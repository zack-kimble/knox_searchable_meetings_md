| 2:32:09| They may not be business owners, but they are artists, they are stay-at-home moms, they are widows,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=9129)|
| 2:32:15| and they are filling an income gap by renting out part of their home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=9135)|
| 2:32:19| To deny STRs the ability to operate in residential districts would deny me the chance to grow my business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=9139)|
| 2:32:25| and others the ability to provide for themselves in the way that we have been.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=9145)|
| 2:32:30| We live in a day and age where simply moving up the ladder does not provide the American dream.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=9150)|
| 2:32:35| As citizens, we must have the opportunity to creatively provide for ourselves and create jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=9155)|
| 2:32:41| I want to see our city of Knoxville support this and find ways to regulate it in a fair manner, and I believe that we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=9161)|
| 2:32:48| The proposed ordinance already calls for non-owner occupants to concede their listings in residential areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=9168)|
| 2:32:55| Please do not let this go further and affect all people in residential zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=9175)|
| 2:33:00| The proposal put together by the short-term rental committee was very generous to both sides and took all concerns into account.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=9180)|
| 2:33:08| The number of STRs will be drastically reduced already by the permitting system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=9188)|
| 2:33:13| It seems to me like the community of STR owners have conceded a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=9193)|
| 2:33:19| On the other side, I see a small group of neighborhood activists acting out of concern for their neighborhoods,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=9199)|
| 2:33:24| but they don't seem willing to concede anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=9204)|
| 2:33:27| We have 105 neighborhoods in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=9207)|
| 2:33:31| As far as I know, based on the agenda packet, only six of them have written in letters against.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=9211)|
| 2:33:37| The other are either for it or they have been silent on the issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=9217)|
| 2:33:41| Please recognize the current proposal recommended by MPC as a fair compromise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=9221)|
| 2:33:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=9226)|
| 2:33:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=9227)|
| 2:33:52| Now, Anne Langendorfer. Did I get that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=9232)|
| 2:33:56| It's Langendorfer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=9236)|
| 2:33:57| Langendorfer, sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=9237)|
| 2:33:58| Yeah, hi. I'm Anne Langendorfer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=9238)|
| 2:34:00| I live at 2921 Arbor Place, which is near the Whittlesprings Golf Course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=9240)|
| 2:34:07| I wasn't planning on speaking tonight, but I think that I could add, I think, a slightly different voice here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=9247)|
| 2:34:16| and that is I am not currently an Airbnb host.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=9256)|
| 2:34:20| The property that we own and have owned for the last two years in North Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=9260)|
| 2:34:26| has a small what's usually called mother-in-law suite in it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=9266)|
| 2:34:32| and we have been renting that out to a colleague of mine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=9272)|
| 2:34:36| Recently, when she moved out, we got talking to friends here in Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=9276)|
| 2:34:41| and they said, have you ever considered renting that little apartment to an Airbnb folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=9281)|
| 2:34:49| instead of a long-term renter?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=9289)|
| 2:34:52| Frankly, I find it kind of compelling because myself and my husband,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=9292)|
| 2:34:57| we've done Airbnb in Charleston, in Sydney, Australia, in Berlin, Germany,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=9297)|
| 2:35:05| and we've had really great experiences.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=9305)|
| 2:35:07| We've been able to stay in parts of the cities that you would never see if you stayed in the hotel core.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=9307)|
| 2:35:13| So one of the things that I find really compelling about the idea of Airbnbs being allowed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=9313)|
| 2:35:19| to operate in residential neighborhoods like mine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=9319)|
| 2:35:22| is the idea that you're bringing people into your community in a much more broad way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=9322)|
| 2:35:28| So we live in a neighborhood that if you came and visited Knoxville as a tourist, you would never see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=9328)|
| 2:35:34| You would never go and have an excellent meal at La Esperanza off of Whittle Springs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=9334)|
| 2:35:40| You would never know about the little places right around the corner from us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=9340)|
| 2:35:46| that offer great hospitality for breakfast,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=9346)|
| 2:35:49| or you'd never get to walk down Fairmont and Emeryland| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=9349)|
| 2:35:53| and see the beautiful architecture that we've been arguing about here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=9353)|
| 2:35:57| So I think that one of the things I'd like to say to city council tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=9357)|
| 2:36:03| is just to understand that the way people travel varies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=9363)|
| 2:36:09| depending on the kind of money they have in their pocket| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=9369)|
| 2:36:12| and the kind of experience they want to have when they travel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=9372)|
| 2:36:15| So if you pass this tonight, I think that we will, my spouse and I,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=9375)|
| 2:36:20| will consider, continue moving towards opening our home,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=9380)|
| 2:36:25| our little mother-in-law suite to Airbnb travelers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=9385)|
| 2:36:31| And when we do that, we will spend our money to furnish that apartment here in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=9391)|
| 2:36:37| Today, I spent $200 at CARM for used furniture and some artwork.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=9397)|
| 2:36:45| All of that would be used for this property, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=9405)|
| 2:36:49| So we would be putting our money here into Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=9409)|
| 2:36:52| We would use money that we made off of our Airbnb earnings to fix up our house,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=9412)|
| 2:36:58| to repair the cracks in the basement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=9418)|
| 2:37:01| to think about whether we could do some better landscaping,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=9421)|
| 2:37:06| whether we could replace our kind of crummy vinyl siding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=9426)|
| 2:37:11| with something that's more appropriate for our beautiful 1947 house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=9431)|
| 2:37:16| So I just ask you tonight to consider the kinds of people who would benefit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=9436)|
| 2:37:20| It's not just owners, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=9440)|
| 2:37:23| People who live in neighborhoods, but also the kind of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=9443)|
| 2:37:27| that we are advertising to tourists who come here for an experience| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=9447)|
| 2:37:32| that they're not going to get in Asheville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=9452)|
| 2:37:34| You go to Asheville, you know you're going to get a certain kind of tourist experience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=9454)|
| 2:37:37| We're going to provide something very different here in Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=9457)|
| 2:37:40| and we can continue to offer a scruffier version of a tourist city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=9460)|
| 2:37:47| if we do it in our individual neighborhoods in these kind of home share situations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=9467)|
| 2:37:51| So I want to say thank you again for considering this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=9471)|
| 2:37:55| and I hope that if you pass this tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=9475)|
| 2:37:59| that you would perhaps offer a grace period| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=9479)|
| 2:38:02| to any non-owner-occupied Airbnb operators,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=9482)|
| 2:38:07| perhaps six months or a year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=9487)|
| 2:38:10| to allow them time to transition their properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=9490)|
| 2:38:14| I think that people who are operating responsibly right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=9494)|
| 2:38:17| with these non-owner-operated properties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=9497)|
| 2:38:20| are going to be put into a bit of a financial crunch| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=9500)|
| 2:38:23| if they don't have some time to negotiate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=9503)|
| 2:38:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=9506)|
| 2:38:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=9507)|
| 2:38:32| Okay, we now move to our next three speakers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=9512)|
| 2:38:34| Larry Silverstein.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=9514)|
| 2:38:37| Thank you for being here, Larry, and you know the routine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=9517)|
| 2:38:46| My name is Larry Silverstein, 7808 Sheffield.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=9526)|
| 2:38:49| Sorry, Larry, I always get that wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=9529)|
| 2:38:52| I try really hard to think that through, but Silverstein.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=9532)|
| 2:38:55| 7808 Sheffield Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=9535)|
| 2:38:57| I speak to you tonight on behalf of Community Forum,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=9537)|
| 2:39:00| which is an advocate for neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=9540)|
| 2:39:02| Our members have always been active in their own neighborhood association| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=9542)|
| 2:39:06| and have a finger on the pulse of our neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=9546)|
| 2:39:09| Our members have frequently served their associations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=9549)|
| 2:39:12| as president and board members for many years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=9552)|
| 2:39:15| Community Forum does not often take official positions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=9555)|
| 2:39:19| but when we go to City Council, Knox County Commission, or MPC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=9559)|
| 2:39:23| it is because an issue will have a significant impact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=9563)|
| 2:39:26| on many residents of the city of Knoxville or Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=9566)|
| 2:39:29| not just a specific neighborhood or property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=9569)|
| 2:39:33| I make these points about Community Forum because tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=9573)|
| 2:39:37| the proposed ordinance before you is indeed a very serious| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=9577)|
| 2:39:41| and important issue for many people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=9581)|
| 2:39:43| We became involved with this issue over a year ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=9583)|
| 2:39:46| long before there was a draft ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=9586)|
| 2:39:48| This ordinance will impact the character of every city neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=9588)|
| 2:39:52| if an amendment is not adopted to exclude short-term rentals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=9592)|
| 2:39:56| from R1 and R1E neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=9596)|
| 2:39:59| We urge you to approve that amendment and others which may be offered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=9599)|
| 2:40:03| if they strengthen the protections for these neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=9603)|
| 2:40:07| For the past seven months since the first draft was published,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=9607)|
| 2:40:10| you have heard much about this ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=9610)|
| 2:40:12| whether at public meetings and workshops or talking to homeowners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=9612)|
| 2:40:16| Tonight, as you debate and consider this ordinance and amendments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=9616)|
| 2:40:20| I hope that you will recognize and focus on the fact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=9620)|
| 2:40:24| that this is clearly and simply a zoning issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=9624)|
| 2:40:28| even if the city's zoning ordinance is not being amended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=9628)|
| 2:40:31| The ordinance should be analyzed as such,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=9631)|
| 2:40:34| not just whether this is a good way for some people to earn money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=9634)|
| 2:40:37| or to meet new people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=9637)|
| 2:40:39| Whether people enjoy staying in short-term rentals or hosting them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=9639)|
| 2:40:42| is irrelevant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=9642)|
| 2:40:44| What matters is whether short-term rentals should be allowed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=9644)|
| 2:40:47| in our R1 and R1E neighborhoods, which are not designed for such uses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=9647)|
| 2:40:52| and which do not presently allow similar uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=9652)|
| 2:40:56| While zoning issues are sometimes difficult issues to decide,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=9656)|
| 2:41:00| many zoning issues that come before MPC and City Council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=9660)|
| 2:41:03| directly affect only a relatively small number of people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=9663)|
| 2:41:08| This zoning issue tonight affects literally tens of thousands of people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=9668)|
| 2:41:13| who reside in some of Knoxville's largest and long-established| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=9673)|
| 2:41:16| R1 and R1E neighborhoods across the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=9676)|
| 2:41:20| Some who disagree with our position say we are just afraid and fear the unknown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=9680)|
| 2:41:25| The members of Community Forum and the residents of ten neighborhoods,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=9685)|
| 2:41:29| Alice Bell Spring Hill, Forest Heights, Fountain City Town Hall,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=9689)|
| 2:41:33| Kingston Pike Sequoia Hills, Norwood, Pond Gap,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=9693)|
| 2:41:37| Tazewell Pike Beverly Station, Wesley Neighbors, West Hills,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=9697)|
| 2:41:41| and Westmoreland Hills have approved resolutions in support of an amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=9701)|
| 2:41:46| to exclude short-term rentals from R1 and R1E zoning districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=9706)|
| 2:41:51| They have adopted resolutions not because they have irrational fears,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=9711)|
| 2:41:55| but because they wanted to communicate to City Council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=9715)|
| 2:41:58| their legitimate concerns about the future of their homes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=9718)|
| 2:42:01| which are often their most valued investment and asset,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=9721)|
| 2:42:05| and concerns about the character and integrity of their neighborhoods,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=9725)|
| 2:42:09| which many of us have lived in for many years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=9729)|
| 2:42:12| We have studied this issue extensively and read articles from all over the country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=9732)|
| 2:42:17| There are many examples of what can go wrong once short-term rentals are allowed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=9737)|
| 2:42:21| particularly if the owner of the property does not have to be present during the rental.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=9741)|
| 2:42:26| We do not want to take an unnecessary risk of safety, traffic, noise,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=9746)|
| 2:42:32| or parking problems next door or down the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=9752)|
| 2:42:35| We do not want our long-standing city zoning ordinance undermined by this ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=9755)|
| 2:42:40| Allowing short-term rentals in R1 and R1E neighborhoods would set a dangerous legal precedent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=9760)|
| 2:42:47| for allowing other similar uses, such as boarding houses and bed-and-breakfasts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=9767)|
| 2:42:51| Our concerns are not irrational and should not be ignored or dismissed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=9771)|
| 2:42:56| We are not advocating a prohibition of all short-term rentals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=9776)|
| 2:43:01| We support fair and reasonable regulations that protect our established neighborhoods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=9781)|
| 2:43:06| from uses that have never been allowed before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=9786)|
| 2:43:09| This ordinance, as drafted, is not adequate to address our concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=9789)|
| 2:43:13| We urge you to please approve the amendment to exclude short-term rentals from R1 and R1E neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=9793)|
| 2:43:20| It is the only way to truly protect the character and integrity of our neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=9800)|
| 2:43:25| I thank you very much for your consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=9805)|
| 2:43:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=9807)|
| 2:43:34| Sandy Gillespie, 4272 Holloway Drive, Knoxville 37919.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=9814)|
| 2:43:41| I'm president of the Kingston Pike Sequoia Hills Association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=9821)|
| 2:43:45| Our board has voted against including R1 and R1E in the short-term rental ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=9825)|
| 2:43:53| I'm reading from a workshop presentation saying the current ordinance does not provide for STR.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=9833)|
| 2:44:02| Complaints are handled individually and enforcement usually involves informing operators| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=9842)|
| 2:44:08| that they are operating a motel in violation of the city's zoning code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=9848)|
| 2:44:15| The R in R1 and R1E stands for residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=9855)|
| 2:44:21| In the current zoning code, the general description for R1 begins with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=9861)|
| 2:44:26| this is the most restrictive residential district and continues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=9866)|
| 2:44:31| And for R1E, this is a restrictive residential district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=9871)|
| 2:44:38| Short-term rentals, referred to as motels, are a commercial enterprise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=9878)|
| 2:44:44| and are not compatible with the current zoning code in our most restrictive residential neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=9884)|
| 2:44:53| Is this proposed ordinance a change in uses permitted in the zoning ordinance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=9893)|
| 2:44:59| I think so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=9899)|
| 2:45:01| Today, short-term rentals are not permitted in R1 or R1E neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=9901)|
| 2:45:08| If you pass this ordinance as is, a new use will be permitted, thus setting a precedent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=9908)|
| 2:45:18| For the first time, a freestanding ordinance will change the uses allowed in residential districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=9918)|
| 2:45:26| Thank you and appreciate your consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=9926)|
| 2:45:28| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=9928)|
| 2:45:34| Dr. Phil Nordstrom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=9934)|
| 2:45:38| Thank you, sir, for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=9938)|
| 2:45:43| Please state your name and address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=9943)|
| 2:45:45| I am Dr. Phil Nordstrom, 5046 Ridgemont Drive, and so Dr. Phil wants to weigh in on this whole thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=9945)|
| 2:45:56| I am speaking against the Airbnb ordinance as proposed, not because I'm against Airbnb,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=9956)|
| 2:46:02| but because I'm a non-owner-occupied, we're operating one, non-owner-occupied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=9962)|
| 2:46:11| When we opened ours just a little over a year ago, I believe that it was a reasonable assumption that it would be legal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=9971)|
| 2:46:18| I think we were told that we were supposed to assume that it was illegal until we were told it was legal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=9978)|
| 2:46:23| But having stated non-owner-occupied Airbnbs all over the country and all over the world, as I'm sure many of you have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=9983)|
| 2:46:31| it was, I thought, a reasonable assumption, especially when we went to Airbnb| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=9991)|
| 2:46:34| and saw all the non-owner-occupied Airbnbs that were in existence already in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=9994)|
| 2:46:42| We came to Knoxville about five years ago at great sacrifice to plant a church in North Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=10002)|
| 2:46:49| In order to plant a church, you have to be entrepreneurial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=10009)|
| 2:46:53| I Uber drive and Lyft drive, and my wife runs an Airbnb.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=10013)|
| 2:47:00| She has achieved super-host status, but instead of receiving a commendation from the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=10020)|
| 2:47:06| we're being told that we are now illegal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=10026)|
| 2:47:09| Many are here to support owner-occupied Airbnbs, and you say this is a great compromise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=10029)|
| 2:47:16| That's because you don't own a non-owner-occupied Airbnb, of course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=10036)|
| 2:47:23| One of our latest bookings is from a family that's coming for Thanksgiving with their 87-year-old mother| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=10043)|
| 2:47:30| to celebrate Thanksgiving with their kids that live in halls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=10050)|
| 2:47:35| They're going to cook a Thanksgiving meal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=10055)|
| 2:47:37| How can you do that in a hotel?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=10057)|
| 2:47:39| What are we going to tell these folks, that they all have to rent hotels downtown for like four different rooms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=10059)|
| 2:47:45| for all the residents that were doing that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=10065)|
| 2:47:47| Another was from a family member who had died.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=10067)|
| 2:47:49| Their family lived in the neighborhood, had too many people in their homes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=10069)|
| 2:47:52| and they were able to stay in our Airbnb and have a place not to live with an owner while they're grieving,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=10072)|
| 2:47:59| but to have a private place with which they could do that grieving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=10079)|
| 2:48:05| I will just want to say that it's a little awkward giving my address, and I'll say that for this reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=10085)|
| 2:48:12| My daughter spoke at a recent meeting and the next week received a letter from, I guess, the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=10092)|
| 2:48:19| with a cease and desist threatening a criminal behavior and a fine if she was going to continue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=10099)|
| 2:48:27| To me, this is a social justice issue that I feel very strongly about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=10107)|
| 2:48:32| There's not a lot of issues I'd go to jail for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=10112)|
| 2:48:34| I think this is one that I would, not just because of the economic impact,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=10114)|
| 2:48:38| but because of some of these other issues that have been brought up tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=10118)|
| 2:48:41| I feel like there's a theme, actually, in the meeting tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=10121)|
| 2:48:44| because we are able to help a lot of people that come in that can't afford to stay in hotels,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=10124)|
| 2:48:49| and they're able to stay even if they're lower income in some of our Airbnbs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=10129)|
| 2:48:54| I think we're offering a great service to the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=10134)|
| 2:48:57| We have not received, not only have we not received complaints, my wife's the super host.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=10137)|
| 2:49:02| You'd be honored to stay in our Airbnb.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=10142)|
| 2:49:05| I would challenge any of you to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=10145)|
| 2:49:07| And we're not hurting your neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=10147)|
| 2:49:09| We're helping your neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=10149)|
| 2:49:11| We're good neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=10151)|
| 2:49:12| We'll be good neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=10152)|
| 2:49:14| And we're increasing the value of the homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=10154)|
| 2:49:17| And there's just a slight whiff of, I don't even want to say it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=10157)|
| 2:49:23| but I was in the play one time, A Raisin in the Sun,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=10163)|
| 2:49:26| and I played the one white member of that cast who is the welcoming committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=10166)|
| 2:49:32| to the black family that's coming into their neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=10172)|
| 2:49:35| and very subtly says, rightly or wrongly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=10175)|
| 2:49:39| shouldn't people be able to live in the neighborhoods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=10179)|
| 2:49:43| or keep the neighborhoods the way they want their neighborhoods to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=10183)|
| 2:49:46| And at the end of that quote, he basically said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=10186)|
| 2:49:57| and we think that you Negroes are much happier| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=10197)|
| 2:50:01| if you live in communities with similar people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=10201)|
| 2:50:04| There's just been a sense in this whole meeting tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=10204)|
| 2:50:07| of let's keep our neighborhood the way that we want to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=10207)|
| 2:50:10| but there are people that are coming into our communities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=10210)|
| 2:50:13| that maybe can't afford five hotel rooms downtown| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=10213)|
| 2:50:16| that need places to stay with their families.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=10216)|
| 2:50:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=10218)|
| 2:50:19| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=10219)|
| 2:50:20| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=10220)|
| 2:50:23| Mayor, we cut out a fourth person| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=10223)|
| 2:50:26| because he was supposedly on the other side of this issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=10226)|
| 2:50:30| but he's clearly on the pro side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=10230)|
| 2:50:32| We should let the fourth person speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=10232)|
| 2:50:34| Well, he was against it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=10234)|
| 2:50:35| He was against it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=10235)|
| 2:50:36| He was against it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=10236)|
| 2:50:37| He's against being excluded, but he's for Bear B&Bs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=10237)|
| 2:50:40| I was told to speak for the side against it, like you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=10240)|
| 2:50:45| He's opposed to the ordinance as it's proposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=10245)|
| 2:50:47| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=10247)|
| 2:50:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=10251)|
| 2:50:54| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=10254)|
| 2:50:55| So those are the end of the speakers from the public tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=10255)|
| 2:51:05| So, okay, Vice Mayor Grieve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=10265)|
| 2:51:08| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=10268)|
| 2:51:10| I want to say that this has been an extremely difficult.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=10270)|
| 2:51:14| Pardon me, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=10274)|
| 2:51:16| Why are you approaching?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=10276)|
| 2:51:19| I am clearly on one side rather than the side that Dr. Nordstrom is taking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=10279)|
| 2:51:28| Well, that's the complexity of this issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=10288)|
| 2:51:30| that there are for and against are not as clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=10290)|
| 2:51:34| He's against the ordinance for a different reason than you're against the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=10294)|
| 2:51:38| So I'm going to ask for the wishes of council on how to handle this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=10298)|
| 2:51:45| We've heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=10305)|
| 2:51:47| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=10307)|
| 2:51:48| Let's move on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=10308)|
| 2:51:49| I think, ma'am, they all feel like they have heard from all sides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=10309)|
| 2:51:53| We heard three people who are against the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=10313)|
| 2:51:55| Often people who are against are there for different reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=10315)|
| 2:51:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=10318)|
| 2:51:59| I would be speaking for security, safety, and the welfare of children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=10319)|
| 2:52:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=10323)|
| 2:52:04| Thank you, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=10324)|
| 2:52:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=10326)|
| 2:52:07| So.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=10327)|
| 2:52:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=10332)|
| 2:52:13| Who wants to speak first?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=10333)|
| 2:52:14| Vice Mayor Grave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=10334)|
| 2:52:16| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=10336)|
| 2:52:17| As I was getting ready to say, this has been a very, very tough kind of situation to deal with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=10337)|
| 2:52:22| And as I've mentioned before in the last eight years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=10342)|
| 2:52:25| that this is one issue that affects almost all of us that live in the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=10345)|
| 2:52:30| much more so than when you referred to the sign ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=10350)|
| 2:52:34| And I do want to say that I personally feel and philosophically am opposed to the short-term rentals in the R1 and the R1E.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=10354)|
| 2:52:45| I'm not against short-term rentals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=10365)|
| 2:52:47| but I do think that we have a situation here where there's a potential slippery slope that we might be headed down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=10367)|
| 2:52:54| in terms of allowing uses in the R1 and the R1E.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=10374)|
| 2:53:00| And as a number of the issues that have already been talked about, I'm not going to repeat,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=10380)|
| 2:53:04| but I do want to just say that I want to read two items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=10384)|
| 2:53:09| One has to do with R1 low-density residential districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=10389)|
| 2:53:13| This is the most restrictive residential district intended for low-density residential land uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=10393)|
| 2:53:19| Additional permitted uses by review of the planning commission include related non-commercial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=10399)|
| 2:53:26| recreational, religious, and educational facilities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=10406)|
| 2:53:29| normally required to provide the basic elements of a balanced and attractive residential area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=10409)|
| 2:53:36| That's a direct quote from our zoning ordinance that has to do with the R1 low-density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=10416)|
| 2:53:42| In the R1E low-density exclusive residential districts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=10422)|
| 2:53:46| this is a restrictive residential district intended to be used for establishing low-density residential subdivisions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=10426)|
| 2:53:53| in areas immediately adjacent to such development intended to be defined| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=10433)|
| 2:53:58| and protected from encroachment uses not performing a function necessary to the low-density residential environment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=10438)|
| 2:54:07| I think that if we, if the administration, and if this council passes this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=10447)|
| 2:54:12| I think one of the things that we've done is we've gutted what our zoning ordinance is all about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=10452)|
| 2:54:17| and that I really feel that where do we stop?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=10457)|
| 2:54:20| Where do we add other kinds of uses that we might want to not only add to our residential areas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=10460)|
| 2:54:27| but other areas that we now restrict certain uses on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=10467)|
| 2:54:31| And so what I'd like to do is I have several amendments, and by the way, Mayor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=10471)|
| 2:54:35| I want to thank you and your administration and staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=10475)|
| 2:54:40| We've worked together the last couple of weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=10480)|
| 2:54:43| I apologize to my colleagues that I finally got these amendments onto the forum,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=10483)|
| 2:54:48| which, by the way, that was the first and will be the last time I use the forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=10488)|
| 2:54:53| But I did get that on there today, and you do have copies of that in front.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=10493)|
| 2:54:58| And I think that if, to me, one of the most important things about anything that we do in government has to do with compromise,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=10498)|
| 2:55:07| and I know that you've talked about that there have been compromises in order to bring this together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=10507)|
| 2:55:13| And I think that we have an opportunity tonight on first reading to look at this ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=10513)|
| 2:55:18| and possibly have certain compromises.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=10518)|
| 2:55:21| If certain things don't go the way some of us would like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=10521)|
| 2:55:24| then maybe there's other possibilities that we can look at it in terms of what I'm talking about for the compromises.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=10524)|
| 2:55:31| So, as I mentioned to you, I have a number of different amendments that I'd like to attach to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=10531)|
| 2:55:37| I know there's been talk on why this hasn't been done sooner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=10537)|
| 2:55:41| I think that all of us need to understand that a lot of times that until what you might call the heat starts to rise,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=10541)|
| 2:55:48| that's when we really get totally involved in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=10548)|
| 2:55:51| So I don't know if some of my colleagues want to have some comments before I place some of these amendments on the table,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=10551)|
| 2:55:57| but I would like to propose several amendments on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=10557)|
| 2:56:00| Anybody want to say anything before he begins?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=10560)|
| 2:56:02| And I can go ahead and put the first one on if you want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=10562)|
| 2:56:04| Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=10564)|
| 2:56:06| I want to go back to Gerald and Krista to address this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=10566)|
| 2:56:14| They keep talking about, and we've talked a lot about this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=10574)|
| 2:56:16| and you and I have had conversations, had conversations with Frost and different ones about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=10576)|
| 2:56:21| Is this a zoning issue? Is this a land issue?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=10581)|
| 2:56:24| And why are we not putting it in the zoning ordinance per se and saying as we would?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=10584)|
| 2:56:33| I mean, why are we looking at it the way we're looking at it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=10593)|
| 2:56:36| I think Charles Swanson called it police powers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=10596)|
| 2:56:39| I mean, why are we taking this tack?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=10599)|
| 2:56:41| And, you know, what's your opinion on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=10601)|
| 2:56:43| What's the legal opinion on that and how we got to this position of looking at it outside of truly a zoning ordinance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=10603)|
| 2:56:53| I'll let Krista go first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=10613)|
| 2:56:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=10615)|
| 2:56:56| Thank you, Gerald.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=10616)|
| 2:57:00| I was expecting this question to come up, so I have some talking points,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=10620)|
| 2:57:05| and I'm just going to run through them even though I think I've talked about some of this on prior occasions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=10625)|
| 2:57:11| And I'll reiterate what Charles has said, that this is an exercise of our police powers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=10631)|
| 2:57:15| and falls in line with a lot of our other permitting and licensing processes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=10635)|
| 2:57:20| such as food trucks, taxis, secondhand sales businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=10640)|
| 2:57:24| And to the extent that it is a land use regulation, which I think, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=10644)|
| 2:57:28| I think it would be somewhat disingenuous to say that this is not land use related,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=10648)|
| 2:57:34| because the city has followed the statutory procedures required by law,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=10654)|
| 2:57:37| which is why it has gone to the planning commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=10657)|
| 2:57:41| But land use regulations are not necessarily required to be in Appendix B of the zoning code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=10661)|
| 2:57:47| For example, the city prohibits commercial indoor shooting ranges in Chapter 19 of our zoning code,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=10667)|
| 2:57:55| which is – or Chapter 19 of our city code, which is not in our zoning code,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=10675)|
| 2:57:59| but is arguably a limitation on how people can use their land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=10679)|
| 2:58:03| So that's just an example of something that exists that regulates land but is not in our zoning code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=10683)|
| 2:58:10| So we're not required to put it in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=10690)|
| 2:58:13| And I think the benefit to housing the ordinance outside of the zoning code| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=10693)|
| 2:58:16| is the flexibility that it gives us in changing the ordinance in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=10696)|
| 2:58:21| Amending the zoning code for this ordinance could lead to vested rights arguments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=10701)|
| 2:58:25| which is a bell that's very difficult to un-ring, and we've seen that in Nashville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=10705)|
| 2:58:30| I think that they're really struggling with amending their ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=10710)|
| 2:58:34| and handling the permits and existing operations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=10714)|
| 2:58:40| And then finally, this doesn't need to be in the zoning code| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=10720)|
| 2:58:42| because the short-term rental is an extension of the residential use that's already permitted at the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=10722)|
| 2:58:48| We allow long-term rentals, but don't call that out in our zoning code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=10728)|
| 2:58:52| And especially for the residential districts where the owner-occupied limitation is imposed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=10732)|
| 2:58:56| the primary use remains the residential use by the owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=10736)|
| 2:59:02| And the rental, the short-term rental, is simply auxiliary or accessory to that primary residential use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=10742)|
| 2:59:09| So ultimately, the law has recognized short-term rentals and rentals as a property right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=10749)|
| 2:59:16| that goes along with the bundle of rights that someone has when they own property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=10756)|
| 2:59:21| And the city, of course, can reasonably regulate how those activities are conducted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=10761)|
| 2:59:26| which is what we're doing here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=10766)|
| 2:59:28| So do you think if we were in the zoning ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=10768)|
| 2:59:33| would that open up restrictions on long-term rentals?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=10773)|
| 2:59:40| Would that give us problems when we'd have no restrictions now on long-term rentals?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=10780)|
| 2:59:46| Would that be more problematic for long-term rentals?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=10786)|
| 2:59:50| Do you think that would be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=10790)|
| 2:59:52| I think that that's probably an entirely different discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=10792)|
| 2:59:58| I know it has been ongoing as far as the Office of Neighborhoods and Community Development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=10798)|
| 3:00:03| how we look at long-term rentals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=10803)|
| 3:00:05| But I think it could create some problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=10805)|
| 3:00:08| My primary concern from a legal perspective is vested rights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=10808)|
| 3:00:12| This doesn't change the way we look at long-term rentals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=10812)|
| 3:00:16| That's maybe a better way to look at that and say that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=10816)|
| 3:00:19| This ordinance, the way it's being proposed tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=10819)|
| 3:00:22| doesn't have us to look at long-term rentals in a different way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=10822)|
| 3:00:26| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=10826)|
| 3:00:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=10827)|
| 3:00:28| And it doesn't change any of the rights that people have now with long-term rentals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=10828)|
| 3:00:31| It doesn't affect that at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=10831)|
| 3:00:34| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=10834)|
| 3:00:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=10835)|
| 3:00:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=10836)|
| 3:00:37| That's really most of my questions for now, and then you can go back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=10837)|
| 3:00:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=10839)|
| 3:00:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=10840)|
| 3:00:41| Any others before?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=10841)|
| 3:00:44| Do you want to talk?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=10844)|
| 3:00:45| I just want to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=10845)|
| 3:00:48| I guess, Mayor, this is a question to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=10848)|
| 3:00:50| We've talked about and several people mentioned that if we go forward with this ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=10850)|
| 3:00:55| that we have the opportunity in the future to tweak it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=10855)|
| 3:00:58| So the question I have is why don't we tweak it now and not have the R1 and the R1E in it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=10858)|
| 3:01:05| but go ahead and proceed with it without those two?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=10865)|
| 3:01:08| What was your thinking about that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=10868)|
| 3:01:11| Well, I'll call on Dr. Lyons to address that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=10871)|
| 3:01:16| We do not think it would be best practice at all to exclude R1 and R1E.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=10876)|
| 3:01:21| This has been done twice, and Gerald has opined at the workshop, as you may recall,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=10881)|
| 3:01:26| but there's nothing about that designation that would lead to a rationale for separating R1| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=10886)|
| 3:01:32| and R1E from a perspective of land use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=10892)|
| 3:01:35| I don't want to speak for Gerald any further than that, but that is one thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=10895)|
| 3:01:39| Also, from a policy perspective, it would exclude well over 60 percent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=10899)|
| 3:01:44| just as a quick estimate, of the houses in the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=10904)|
| 3:01:48| from people being able to have an owner-occupied short-term rental.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=10908)|
| 3:01:54| It would do so in a way that's scattered and leads to very difficult situations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=10914)|
| 3:01:58| one house being right next to another, one would be R1, one would be another designation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=10918)|
| 3:02:04| and it would lead to great enforcement difficulties in doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=10924)|
| 3:02:08| So we think that exclusion would be far too great,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=10928)|
| 3:02:12| would limit the ability of people in other neighborhoods to have the ability to participate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=10932)|
| 3:02:21| and to make their home available and to get the income along with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=10941)|
| 3:02:25| But mostly we think it is not anything that would be enforceable without great difficulty| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=10945)|
| 3:02:33| and would lead to an exclusion of a massive number of homes for no real rationale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=10953)|
| 3:02:39| Gerald, what was your take?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=10959)|
| 3:02:42| Similar to Dr. Lyons, that all our residential districts are designed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=10962)|
| 3:02:47| to protect the residential use of those properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=10967)|
| 3:02:50| As Krista said, the short-term rental is an extension of that residential use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=10970)|
| 3:02:55| Trying to make distinctions among the residential districts I think would be difficult,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=10975)|
| 3:03:00| would be unfair to those residents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=10980)|
| 3:03:02| I'll again reiterate what Dr. Lyons said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=10982)|
| 3:03:05| In my neighborhood, a block and a half away is R1A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=10985)|
| 3:03:12| There's no difference in that neighborhood than in my R1 neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=10992)|
| 3:03:17| How could I justify telling the person in the R1A that they could have a short-term rental| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=10997)|
| 3:03:23| right across the street in the R1 and they could not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=11003)|
| 3:03:27| How would we justify that distinction among those residential districts?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=11007)|
| 3:03:32| Going even further, how could we justify the distinction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=11012)|
| 3:03:36| if these are again perceived as extensions of residential uses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=11016)|
| 3:03:40| between an R1 district and an R2 district?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=11020)|
| 3:03:44| Doesn't the R2, the resident of a single-family home in the R2 district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=11024)|
| 3:03:49| deserve to be treated the same as the resident of a single-family home in an R1 district?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=11029)|
| 3:03:54| I just can't find those distinctions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=11034)|
| 3:03:56| Well, I guess I respectfully disagree with you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=11036)|
| 3:03:59| because an R1 is set up just like what I read in the zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=11039)|
| 3:04:03| It seems to me that when you're talking about trying to respect those other people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=11043)|
| 3:04:09| in the other areas to allow this to happen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=11049)|
| 3:04:13| what are we doing to respect those people that have bought homes in an R1| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=11053)|
| 3:04:17| and expect it to be a single-family residential area?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=11057)|
| 3:04:20| It's still a single-family residential area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=11060)|
| 3:04:23| As Krista pointed out, this is perceived as an extension of that residential use of that property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=11063)|
| 3:04:28| so they're still in a residential district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=11068)|
| 3:04:31| But in our zoning ordinance, it doesn't talk about that as far as being a use, does it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=11071)|
| 3:04:36| And this, again, is not an amendment to the zoning ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=11076)|
| 3:04:40| It's being moved forward under Chapter 16| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=11080)|
| 3:04:45| as licensing of a use that would be permitted on a par and evenly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=11085)|
| 3:04:51| in all residential districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=11091)|
| 3:04:53| So if I want to come to the city and say that I want to allow small engine repair shops in R1,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=11093)|
| 3:05:01| I would go to this method as opposed to go to zoning for approval by the Zoning Commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=11101)|
| 3:05:07| I mean, where do we draw the line?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=11107)|
| 3:05:10| And any citizen can petition for any change in the ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=11110)|
| 3:05:14| that they feel is appropriate and justified, and that's up to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=11114)|
| 3:05:19| Unfortunately, you are the stopping point for those who are requesting it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=11119)|
| 3:05:25| As you're finding this evening, they're difficult.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=11125)|
| 3:05:30| Councilman Della Vothe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=11130)|
| 3:05:31| Yeah, thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=11131)|
| 3:05:32| I want to go back to the point that was raised by Mr. Wallace and answered in part, I think, by Krista.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=11132)|
| 3:05:39| George, I think the distinction she's trying to make, but she hadn't said it plain enough for us to understand,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=11139)|
| 3:05:44| is if you put it in the zoning ordinance and then someone does it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=11144)|
| 3:05:49| and later you change it, they're grandfathered under the Dern State Law and they can keep doing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=11149)|
| 3:05:55| And she's saying, and Mr. Swanson's saying, if it's a license, it's a permission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=11155)|
| 3:06:00| and you can grant it and then you cannot grant it the next year and change your licensing laws.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=11160)|
| 3:06:06| So it's at least a movable feast rather than one where people acquire what she called vested rights,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=11166)|
| 3:06:13| which is lawyer talk for you get grandfathered in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=11173)|
| 3:06:17| I think that's the thrust of the distinction she's trying to make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=11177)|
| 3:06:21| The point, though, and it's been batted around by Dr. Lyons, it's been batted around by Gerald Green,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=11181)|
| 3:06:27| is what are we doing here, and I don't know that I still get it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=11187)|
| 3:06:32| and that is people move into a neighborhood based on the character of what they see,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=11192)|
| 3:06:39| the type of housing, the type of restrictions, the type of uses that are allowed there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=11199)|
| 3:06:44| and they spend a lot of their personal fortune on buying and fixing up their house,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=11204)|
| 3:06:50| and in some cases they live there for decades.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=11210)|
| 3:06:53| And we're coming in now with a licensing law, a permit law, that changes that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=11213)|
| 3:07:00| And that's where the tension comes in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=11220)|
| 3:07:03| I mean, you know, what's going to happen next door?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=11223)|
| 3:07:07| We have spent inordinate energy and healthy energy, I might say, in this city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=11227)|
| 3:07:12| trying to encourage neighborhoods to be healthy, to be cohesive, to have neighborhood groups,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=11232)|
| 3:07:18| to have watch groups, to keep an eye on when strangers are in your neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=11238)|
| 3:07:23| and report suspicious activity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=11243)|
| 3:07:28| I mean, that person doesn't belong here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=11248)|
| 3:07:30| That blue car has never been here, and all of a sudden it's riding back and forth to that house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=11250)|
| 3:07:34| Maybe those folks are in Florida.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=11254)|
| 3:07:36| Are they robbing the house?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=11256)|
| 3:07:38| You make it more difficult to be a cohesive neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=11258)|
| 3:07:42| Now, maybe that's the sign of the times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=11262)|
| 3:07:43| Maybe that's where we're going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=11263)|
| 3:07:45| But that's the objection that's gnawing at some of these groups,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=11265)|
| 3:07:49| is that they depended on the zoning structure as a way of both protecting their investment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=11269)|
| 3:07:58| and exercising their choice of how they want to live.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=11278)|
| 3:08:01| And then we have not just young folks, but a lot of young folks who say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=11281)|
| 3:08:06| look, economy's tough, I ain't getting raises, I'm starting my own business, I want a source of income.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=11286)|
| 3:08:12| And they want to run, for lack of a better word, a business, a hotel, a motel, something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=11292)|
| 3:08:18| a part-time business in their house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=11298)|
| 3:08:21| And the question I hear Duane raising, where do we draw that line?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=11301)|
| 3:08:24| We have some uses that are permitted on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=11304)|
| 3:08:28| If it's a home business or occupation that doesn't bring in cars or traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=11308)|
| 3:08:34| But we struggle with that all the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=11314)|
| 3:08:36| And I don't think there's an easy answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=11316)|
| 3:08:38| But we are changing how people perceive where they live and what's appropriate to happen there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=11318)|
| 3:08:48| And I'm certainly sensitive to the fact that we've got to be very cautious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=11328)|
| 3:08:53| You know, one of the things that we talk about is owner-occupied as being a criteria.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=11333)|
| 3:08:59| Well, and we've said this before, if you go into someone else's house and they're there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=11339)|
| 3:09:05| presumably your mom raised you right and you don't wreck the place or make too much noise or make a mess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=11345)|
| 3:09:10| you're on good behavior.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=11350)|
| 3:09:12| When you start renting whole houses in unoccupied, not owner-occupied places,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=11352)|
| 3:09:18| you know, and you and your buddies get together and pour a little brown liquor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=11358)|
| 3:09:23| I mean, who knows what happens, but it happens at 2 and 3 a.m., hooting and hollering on the porch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=11363)|
| 3:09:28| And that's great for you, but it ain't great for the neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=11368)|
| 3:09:31| So how they're run and, you know, and I heard people say they're very respectful about what they do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=11371)|
| 3:09:36| and who they invite in their house and the rules of the house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=11376)|
| 3:09:39| But not everyone's going to be that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=11379)|
| 3:09:41| We've had one guy come to one of these workshops or hearings we had who bought two houses in Fort Sanders,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=11381)|
| 3:09:48| and he lives in Nashville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=11388)|
| 3:09:49| He just wanted to make some money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=11389)|
| 3:09:50| It was an opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=11390)|
| 3:09:51| Why not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=11391)|
| 3:09:52| I'm going to rent houses there when they come on football weekends.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=11392)|
| 3:09:55| I'm going to get $1,500 for a handful of folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=11395)|
| 3:09:58| So how we allow it or if we allow it and what are the restrictions are important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=11398)|
| 3:10:04| Krista's point is let's not make it permanent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=11404)|
| 3:10:06| We ought to make it at least changeable if we're going to do this by making it a permit you can revoke,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=11406)|
| 3:10:11| a permit you can change the ground rules on rather than a land right that you've been grandfathered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=11411)|
| 3:10:18| based on the wisdom of our legislature that thinks that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=11418)|
| 3:10:21| we have more billboards than we need because they think you can be grandfathered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=11421)|
| 3:10:25| I mean, that's what happens in zoning law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=11425)|
| 3:10:28| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=11428)|
| 3:10:30| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=11430)|
| 3:10:31| Thank you, George.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=11431)|
| 3:10:33| I'm going to go back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=11433)|
| 3:10:34| I was trying to get Nick to take a breath there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=11434)|
| 3:10:36| I had to exhale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=11436)|
| 3:10:40| Take a breath.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=11440)|
| 3:10:41| Well, I'm going to go back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=11441)|
| 3:10:42| I mean, I think it's a real important issue that Krista said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=11442)|
| 3:10:46| and she said that it's an extension of a residential use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=11446)|
| 3:10:52| And, I mean, go back to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=11452)|
| 3:10:56| That's what you're basing this on is that, you know, and you're saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=11456)|
| 3:11:00| you're arguing, if I hear it, why it should be allowed in R1 and R1E| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=11460)|
| 3:11:05| because it should be allowed in any residential zone because it's an extension of residential use's owner's right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=11465)|
| 3:11:13| to lease, to rent the property themselves for their residential use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=11473)|
| 3:11:19| Unlike Mr. Greaves' example of a commercial use, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=11479)|
| 3:11:26| there's a key distinction there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=11486)|
| 3:11:29| I guess I want to go back to what Nick was saying, and I want you to reemphasize that about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=11489)|
| 3:11:34| because I think that's, to me, that's kind of the crux of the matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=11494)|
| 3:11:38| And I guess I wanted you to expand on that just a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=11498)|
| 3:11:42| Not near as long as Nick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=11502)|
| 3:11:44| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=11504)|
| 3:11:45| I mean, I think it's a pretty fundamental principle that when you own property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=11505)|
| 3:11:50| you get sort of what's referred to as the bundle of sticks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=11510)|
| 3:11:53| and that means you get to do certain things with your property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=11513)|
| 3:11:57| You get to transfer it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=11517)|
| 3:11:58| You get to use and enjoy it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=11518)|
| 3:12:00| You get to lease it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=11520)|
| 3:12:02| And so those are some of the things that you get to do with your property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=11522)|
| 3:12:07| And courts have looked at leasing and renting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=11527)|
| 3:12:11| and determined that that is most definitely part of that bundle of sticks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=11531)|
| 3:12:15| Now, obviously, with this being kind of an emerging business model,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=11535)|
| 3:12:20| there's not been a lot of case law on this yet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=11540)|
| 3:12:24| but I think it's very reasonable to conclude that long-term rental| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=11544)|
| 3:12:29| and short-term rental would be treated similarly by courts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=11549)|
| 3:12:33| but that's not been decided in Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=11553)|
| 3:12:35| I do want to be clear about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=11555)|
| 3:12:38| But I think that is how we are looking at this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=11558)|
| 3:12:43| As a property owner of a residential property, you get to do those things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=11563)|
| 3:12:47| and so this is just an extension of your residential use of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=11567)|
| 3:12:56| Vice Mayor Grave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=11576)|
| 3:12:59| Krista, first of all, I appreciate us working together the last couple of weeks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=11579)|
| 3:13:02| but if what you're saying is true,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=11582)|
| 3:13:07| then those people that are operating short-term rentals now, why are they illegal?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=11587)|
| 3:13:15| Well, I think under our current code, as we have it structured,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=11595)|
| 3:13:22| we don't have a method to regulate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=11602)|
| 3:13:25| We don't have the right tools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=11605)|
| 3:13:27| We do get to regulate how people use their property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=11607)|
| 3:13:31| So you can own property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=11611)|
| 3:13:33| You can lease it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=11613)|
| 3:13:34| But we do get to have a say as a local government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=11614)|
| 3:13:38| But you're saying we can lease it now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=11618)|
| 3:13:40| And you're saying that a long-term rental is similar to a short-term rental,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=11620)|
| 3:13:46| so therefore then those people that are operating now are legal?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=11626)|
| 3:13:51| I don't believe that to be true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=11631)|
| 3:13:53| What I'm saying is you get to rent your property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=11633)|
| 3:13:57| The city gets to regulate your property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=11637)|
| 3:14:00| As of right now, we don't have the right tools to regulate the property, the rental,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=11640)|
| 3:14:06| because we have the sort of bulky use of motel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=11646)|
| 3:14:11| which is not quite the right definition to address these types of uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=11651)|
| 3:14:14| So we're coming up with a regulatory scheme to regulate the rentals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=11654)|
| 3:14:18| which we are authorized to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=11658)|
| 3:14:20| Do we not regulate our properties now by our zoning ordinance, though?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=11660)|
| 3:14:25| That's one way we do it, but this is a permitting scheme.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=11665)|
| 3:14:29| Permitting versus zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=11669)|
| 3:14:31| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=11671)|
| 3:14:32| Okay, but I guess the bottom line for me is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=11672)|
| 3:14:34| how are we going to protect those folks who have bought in residential areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=11674)|
| 3:14:39| under the auspices of the R1, such as what Mr. Dellavopi was talking about?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=11679)|
| 3:14:43| How are those people going to be protected?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=11683)|
| 3:14:45| I think one way that we've done that is by incorporating the owner-occupied requirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=11685)|
| 3:14:50| And I don't know if Bill and Jesse want to talk more about this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=11690)|
| 3:14:54| but you have to demonstrate in seeking a Type 1 permit that you own| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=11694)|
| 3:14:59| and occupy on a full-time basis the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=11699)|
| 3:15:02| And we're going to be looking at specific documentation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=11702)|
| 3:15:04| such as vehicle registration, voter registration, to confirm that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=11704)|
| 3:15:08| so that the neighbor who lives in your home will still be living in your home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=11708)|
| 3:15:13| They just may be renting it out from time to time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=11713)|
| 3:15:16| So the owner-occupied requirement, I think, addresses what you've raised.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=11716)|
| 3:15:21| And I don't know if Bill or Jesse want to weigh in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=11721)|
| 3:15:23| Rob Frost would like to respond first, and then we'll call on Dr. Lyons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=11723)|
| 3:15:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=11726)|
| 3:15:27| Just a little bit in response to Vice Mayor, Mr. Grieve,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=11727)|
| 3:15:29| Councilman Wallace, and Ms. Kucrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=11729)|
| 3:15:33| Admittedly, it's a little gray,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=11733)|
| 3:15:36| but what the city, the drafters of this ordinance have set up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=11736)|
| 3:15:40| is something under police powers rather than a planning type of ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=11740)|
| 3:15:47| or planning type of issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=11747)|
| 3:15:48| Let me give you an example of what came earlier in the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=11748)|
| 3:15:52| We had the discussion of the C-4 issue out in the 5th District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=11752)|
| 3:15:57| And that was a land use issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=11757)|
| 3:16:00| And, for example, that land use issue had to be referred back to MPC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=11760)|
| 3:16:05| as part of the planning process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=11765)|
| 3:16:07| Later on in the agenda, we had an ordinance on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=11767)|
| 3:16:12| One dealt with Scrivener's errors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=11772)|
| 3:16:14| One dealt with something, I believe, to do with cars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=11774)|
| 3:16:18| That was a police power type of ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=11778)|
| 3:16:22| And police power ordinances, I mean, using the word police is a slight misnomer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=11782)|
| 3:16:27| That comes from basically the 10th Amendment to the Constitution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=11787)|
| 3:16:31| how things get delegated to the state,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=11791)|
| 3:16:34| who in turn delegate it to local governments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=11794)|
| 3:16:38| But in the 5th District land use situation, as everybody heard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=11798)|
| 3:16:46| everybody was fine with the applicant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=11806)|
| 3:16:48| but there was a concern about what might the next property owner do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=11808)|
| 3:16:54| because there was the issue of the grandfathering in TCA 13-7-208| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=11814)|
| 3:17:01| versus the way the drafters have set up the short-term rental ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=11821)|
| 3:17:07| is that it would be a permitting issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=11827)|
| 3:17:09| It discusses in there that there's no vested rights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=11829)|
| 3:17:12| So the person with the C-4 zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=11832)|
| 3:17:15| can go and do whatever they want under the C-4 zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=11835)|
| 3:17:19| What the drafters of the short-term rental ordinances are proposing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=11839)|
| 3:17:23| is a permit system where if you don't comply with the permit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=11843)|
| 3:17:27| it's not grandfathered and you can go through a process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=11847)|
| 3:17:31| but it can get yanked away from you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=11851)|
| 3:17:34| So I think that helped further explain the questions that were going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=11854)|
| 3:17:42| I might just add briefly to the question of Councilman Grieve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=11862)|
| 3:17:46| about how we're protecting the rights of the property rights| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=11866)|
| 3:17:51| or of the people who are in the R1 and R1E.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=11871)|
| 3:17:54| I think there are two ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=11874)|
| 3:17:55| By excluding the non-owner-occupied,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=11875)|
| 3:17:57| we thought that did actually create a potential hazard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=11877)|
| 3:18:02| for neighborhoods and cohesion in neighborhoods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=11882)|
| 3:18:05| by having the owner-occupied requirement that it's the same owner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=11885)|
| 3:18:10| and people coming and visiting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=11890)|
| 3:18:12| We don't think it has that impact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=11892)|
| 3:18:14| But also, as Mr. Frost just mentioned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=11894)|
| 3:18:17| by having the ability to have a permit that can be withdrawn| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=11897)|
| 3:18:21| if there are issues that occur that they violate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=11901)|
| 3:18:25| in the conduct of running that short-term rental,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=11905)|
| 3:18:29| then that permit can be withdrawn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=11909)|
| 3:18:31| So it gives us flexibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=11911)|
| 3:18:33| And as Krista referenced the permitting system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=11913)|
| 3:18:37| we put things in place to regulate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=11917)|
| 3:18:40| And those regulations, if they're violated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=11920)|
| 3:18:42| give the city the ability to correct any possible damage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=11922)|
| 3:18:46| that might be done along with the existing laws we have for noise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=11926)|
| 3:18:49| and for blocking driveways and other things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=11929)|
| 3:18:51| So we think with the exclusion of the non-owner-occupied,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=11931)|
| 3:18:55| which, as you know, many people disagree with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=11935)|
| 3:18:58| we think the integrity and the fabric of neighborhoods is protected| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=11938)|
| 3:19:01| because you still have the same residential use that you had before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=11941)|
| 3:19:04| which is, of course, the essence of what we're talking about here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=11944)|
| 3:19:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=11950)|
| 3:19:11| Well, I will go ahead and proceed with my amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=11951)|
| 3:19:14| Let's do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=11954)|
| 3:19:15| And we'll see where we get to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=11955)|
| 3:19:17| 934, let's start on those amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=11957)|
| 3:19:19| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=11959)|
| 3:19:20| Let's start with the first one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=11960)|
| 3:19:22| My first motion is I move to amend 2.3.A1| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=11962)|
| 3:19:27| to exclude the R1 and R1E zoning districts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=11967)|
| 3:19:32| as districts where short-term rental units are allowed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=11972)|
| 3:19:36| That's my first amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=11976)|
| 3:19:40| My first motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=11980)|
| 3:19:41| That's what we have here, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=11981)|
| 3:19:42| Exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=11982)|
| 3:19:43| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=11983)|
| 3:19:44| Krista, we changed it, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=11984)|
| 3:19:45| It looks a little different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=11985)|
| 3:19:46| He said it differently, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=11986)|
| 3:19:47| But everyone understands it's basically to exclude R1 and R1E from the SDRs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=11987)|
| 3:19:52| We took it out of the definition aspect and put it into the proper place, right, Krista?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=11992)|
| 3:19:56| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=11996)|
| 3:19:58| So that's my motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=11998)|
| 3:20:00| And staff has already addressed it, so I guess we don't need to say that again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=12000)|
| 3:20:06| So, Councilman Powers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=12006)|
| 3:20:08| I would like to offer up an amendment to that motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=12008)|
| 3:20:12| I still, you know, since the get-go of this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=12012)|
| 3:20:17| I still think that it's the right thing to do to let the ones that are currently in business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=12017)|
| 3:20:25| whatever the zone is, there's been, you know, I know there's been a lot of investment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=12025)|
| 3:20:31| I live in R1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=12031)|
| 3:20:32| I've got a big investment, and I've heard about all the investments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=12032)|
| 3:20:35| But still, I think that it's the right thing to do to allow those that are up and running now a grace period,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=12035)|
| 3:20:44| not only for them, but it would, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=12044)|
| 3:20:47| you would have to include others that have sat on the sidelines watching this whole process work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=12047)|
| 3:20:54| I don't know how many people that is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=12054)|
| 3:20:57| I wouldn't suspect it would be a huge amount.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=12057)|
| 3:21:00| But, you know, perhaps I eat those words, but I don't think so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=12060)|
| 3:21:04| But I think that it's just fair that we let that investment that they've made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=12064)|
| 3:21:12| I feel strongly that they've made their neighborhoods better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=12072)|
| 3:21:17| We've heard that there hasn't been huge enforcement problems or complaints.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=12077)|
| 3:21:23| So, you know, I want to make the motion or amend that motion to ‑‑| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=12083)|
| 3:21:29| There was no second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=12089)|
| 3:21:30| Actually, first, yeah, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=12090)|
| 3:21:32| That was my mistake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=12092)|
| 3:21:33| First, we need a second to Vice Mayor Grieve's motion, which is to remove, exclude R1 and R1E.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=12093)|
| 3:21:43| My fault.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=12103)|
| 3:21:44| I thought there was a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=12104)|
| 3:21:45| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=12105)|
| 3:21:46| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=12106)|
| 3:21:47| I should have ‑‑ is there a second to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=12107)|
| 3:21:51| There's no second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=12111)|
| 3:21:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=12112)|
| 3:21:53| So that motion fails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=12113)|
| 3:21:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=12114)|
| 3:21:55| Point of order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=12115)|
| 3:21:58| Are we going to vote on the amendments individually as we put them up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=12118)|
| 3:22:04| Like, are we going to vote on this and then kind of go and just order different ones?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=12124)|
| 3:22:09| I didn't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=12129)|
| 3:22:10| Yeah, sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=12130)|
| 3:22:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=12131)|
| 3:22:12| So like we typically do, we have the main motion, which is as presented,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=12132)|
| 3:22:17| and then we will go through as many amendments as you all want to propose,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=12137)|
| 3:22:23| and we vote on the amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=12143)|
| 3:22:25| In this case, it was an amendment to the amendment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=12145)|
| 3:22:27| but if your original amendment excluding the R1s and R1Es does not get a second,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=12147)|
| 3:22:35| then that fails, and then we can go on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=12155)|
| 3:22:38| You can always bring that up later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=12158)|
| 3:22:40| Well, do we vote on Nick's as we go?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=12160)|
| 3:22:42| Is that the plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=12162)|
| 3:22:44| That will come up again because the first motion failed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=12164)|
| 3:22:47| He can bring that up again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=12167)|
| 3:22:49| So he's bringing it up again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=12169)|
| 3:22:51| Do you want to make that motion now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=12171)|
| 3:22:53| or do you want to wait for him, Vice Mayor Grave, to continue?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=12173)|
| 3:22:55| I'll work through the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=12175)|
| 3:22:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=12176)|
| 3:22:57| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=12177)|
| 3:22:58| So the motion to exclude R1s and R1Es fails due to lack of a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=12178)|
| 3:23:02| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=12182)|
| 3:23:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=12185)|
| 3:23:06| Do you want to go on then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=12186)|
| 3:23:07| I'll continue on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=12187)|
| 3:23:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=12188)|
| 3:23:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=12190)|
| 3:23:11| My next motion is I move to amend Division IV operational requirements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=12191)|
| 3:23:14| at Section 4.3 maximum occupancy to allow a maximum occupancy of eight transients.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=12194)|
| 3:23:22| That is based on the fact that the majority of, of course,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=12202)|
| 3:23:25| the majority of what we understand of short-term rentals are two bedrooms,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=12205)|
| 3:23:29| but there is the possibility of three bedrooms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=12209)|
| 3:23:31| So this would be reducing it from 12 to eight as a compromise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=12211)|
| 3:23:37| Is there a second to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=12217)|
| 3:23:40| Or are there any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=12220)|
| 3:23:41| I want to find out how he got that number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=12221)|
| 3:23:43| Why not six or five?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=12223)|
| 3:23:45| Three bedrooms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=12225)|
| 3:23:46| Three bedrooms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=12226)|
| 3:23:47| Two people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=12227)|
| 3:23:48| And then they're allowing for two additional.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=12228)|
| 3:23:51| You know, they might sleep on the couch or something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=12231)|
| 3:23:54| And so they're allowing eight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=12234)|
| 3:23:55| That's how they came up with 12 versus the number of bedrooms plus two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=12235)|
| 3:23:58| No, the reason they said 12 in the past, which was a huge number as far as I'm concerned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=12238)|
| 3:24:03| was that the fire marshal finally said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=12243)|
| 3:24:05| well, you can't have that many people in a building without burning down the world| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=12245)|
| 3:24:09| and killing a bunch of folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=12249)|
| 3:24:10| But that was the only restriction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=12250)|
| 3:24:12| And I'm agreeing with you that there needs to be some restriction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=12252)|
| 3:24:15| of the number of transients you have there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=12255)|
| 3:24:17| But I didn't know if there was a magic reason for eight as opposed to six.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=12257)|
| 3:24:20| Well, no, I just based that on the fact of three bedrooms plus two additional people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=12260)|
| 3:24:25| That would be eight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=12265)|
| 3:24:26| Dr. Limes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=12266)|
| 3:24:28| He's over there laughing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=12268)|
| 3:24:29| We certainly don't have an objection to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=12269)|
| 3:24:32| I think Counselor DelVolpe did state the reason that it was originally set.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=12272)|
| 3:24:36| We do think there are some enforcement challenges with it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=12276)|
| 3:24:38| but those enforcement challenges would exist with 12 as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=12278)|
| 3:24:41| The 12 was a pure safety thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=12281)|
| 3:24:44| The fire marshal says we can't have that many bodies in one building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=12284)|
| 3:24:48| But it was based on you still had to have the right number of bedrooms in order to get the 12.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=12288)|
| 3:24:53| And so what I'm saying is we're trying to find some compromises here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=12293)|
| 3:24:58| I think this is a compromise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=12298)|
| 3:25:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=12301)|
| 3:25:02| Is there a second to his amendment to reduce the number of transients from 12 to eight?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=12302)|
| 3:25:08| I'll second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=12308)|
| 3:25:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=12309)|
| 3:25:10| Do you want to speak to that, Councilman Saunders?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=12310)|
| 3:25:13| Yes, thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=12313)|
| 3:25:15| I'm not bothered by that, but it gets to exactly what Dr. Limes said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=12315)|
| 3:25:20| How do you enforce it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=12320)|
| 3:25:23| You can't enforce any of this stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=12323)|
| 3:25:24| How do you enforce 12?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=12324)|
| 3:25:25| Someone's got to go out there and look.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=12325)|
| 3:25:30| Peter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=12330)|
| 3:25:31| Peter Ahrens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=12331)|
| 3:25:34| Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=12334)|
| 3:25:35| Peter Ahrens, Director of Plans Review and Inspections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=12335)|
| 3:25:39| Let me backtrack just a brief moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=12339)|
| 3:25:42| When we get over 12, the building code changes from the International Residential Code to the International Building Code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=12342)|
| 3:25:48| So we came up with a 12 number to keep it under the residential code to maintain the integrity of the residential neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=12348)|
| 3:25:57| As far as enforcement goes, we can track the numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=12357)|
| 3:26:03| We're anticipating utilizing a third party who can track that for us and let us know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=12363)|
| 3:26:14| But if the number, if the council wants to have a lower number, that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=12374)|
| 3:26:21| We can adjust.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=12381)|
| 3:26:23| We prefer not to go over 12.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=12383)|
| 3:26:27| So do I.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=12387)|
| 3:26:29| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=12389)|
| 3:26:30| Thank you, Peter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=12390)|
| 3:26:31| Peter, don't go far.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=12391)|
| 3:26:32| Two-thirds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=12392)|
| 3:26:33| Two-thirds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=12393)|
| 3:26:34| May be called upon again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=12394)|
| 3:26:37| Mayor, aren't there some five-bedroom houses?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=12397)|
| 3:26:41| Yeah, and that's too many.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=12401)|
| 3:26:43| That's too many to have a five-bedroom house?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=12403)|
| 3:26:45| I mean, there's some houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=12405)|
| 3:26:46| For your family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=12406)|
| 3:26:47| You can have your family in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=12407)|
| 3:26:49| That's the point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=12409)|
| 3:26:50| I mean, it's really per bedroom, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=12410)|
| 3:26:52| I mean, there's five-bedroom houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=12412)|
| 3:26:54| I mean, we have plenty of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=12414)|
| 3:26:57| You want the permit or not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=12417)|
| 3:26:59| I'm just asking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=12419)|
| 3:27:01| Make it 10.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=12421)|
| 3:27:03| Some in my neighborhood are that big, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=12423)|
| 3:27:07| That's my motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=12427)|
| 3:27:08| Okay, so we have a motion and a second to reduce the number from 12 to 8.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=12428)|
| 3:27:15| You ready to vote on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=12435)|
| 3:27:17| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=12437)|
| 3:27:18| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=12438)|
| 3:27:20| All opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=12440)|
| 3:27:21| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=12441)|
| 3:27:22| I think there were three for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=12442)|
| 3:27:24| There were two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=12444)|
| 3:27:26| Who said no?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=12446)|
| 3:27:27| I was four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=12447)|
| 3:27:28| Who said aye?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=12448)|
| 3:27:29| Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=12449)|
| 3:27:30| I was four for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=12450)|
| 3:27:32| I'm saying four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=12452)|
| 3:27:33| You're for just having eight?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=12453)|
| 3:27:35| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=12455)|
| 3:27:36| Okay, it was Mayor Brown, Grieve, and Gallivofi, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=12456)|
| 3:27:40| They voted for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=12460)|
| 3:27:42| Isn't that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=12462)|
| 3:27:43| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=12463)|
| 3:27:44| Okay, so the vote is three to six, so the motion fails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=12464)|
| 3:27:48| Okay, two down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=12468)|
| 3:27:51| Okay, moving on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=12471)|
| 3:27:53| Moving on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=12473)|
| 3:27:54| Okay, my next motion is to I move to amend Division 2,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=12474)|
| 3:27:59| Permit Types, Applications, and Insurance at Section 2.3A1,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=12479)|
| 3:28:05| Type 1 Operating Permit, Owner Occupied,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=12485)|
| 3:28:08| so that the owner is required to remain on the permitted premises| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=12488)|
| 3:28:12| during the transient's occupancy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=12492)|
| 3:28:16| And we've added to that in terms of where we say that they're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=12496)|
| 3:28:24| allowed for occasional errands or occupational obligations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=12504)|
| 3:28:28| none of which shall require the owner to be away from the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=12508)|
| 3:28:30| short-term rental unit for more than 12 consecutive hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=12510)|
| 3:28:34| But basically we want the owner to be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=12514)|
| 3:28:40| That's the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=12520)|
| 3:28:41| Okay, is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=12521)|
| 3:28:42| I'll second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=12522)|
| 3:28:43| Okay, we have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=12523)|
| 3:28:45| Is there a discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=12525)|
| 3:28:47| Yes, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=12527)|
| 3:28:48| Isn't that already covered in the proposed amendment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=12528)|
| 3:28:52| the owner occupied?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=12532)|
| 3:28:54| You don't specify time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=12534)|
| 3:28:55| Once again, enforcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=12535)|
| 3:28:57| I think, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=12537)|
| 3:28:59| What this deals with is having that owner actually physically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=12539)|
| 3:29:02| present at all times, minus the exceptions that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=12542)|
| 3:29:06| Councilman Reed pointed out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=12546)|
| 3:29:07| And we do not think this is a wise thing to do because it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=12547)|
| 3:29:10| creates tremendous enforcement challenges Peter could address| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=12550)|
| 3:29:14| and will address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=12554)|
| 3:29:21| I don't know of a practical way to monitor each short-term rental| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=12561)|
| 3:29:27| and verify the presence of an owner the way it's set up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=12567)|
| 3:29:32| We verify that they truly do own it and they live there on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=12572)|
| 3:29:35| front end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=12575)|
| 3:29:37| But if they go to a motel that night or they go to a friend's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=12577)|
| 3:29:41| house, there's no way for us to track that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=12581)|
| 3:29:44| Okay, but what can happen is at least the neighbor next door| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=12584)|
| 3:29:48| knows that that person is supposed to be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=12588)|
| 3:29:50| If they're gone, they can turn it in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=12590)|
| 3:29:53| just like a number of our other kinds of codes that we have to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=12593)|
| 3:29:56| deal with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=12596)|
| 3:29:57| It's by complaint driven.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=12597)|
| 3:29:58| But if I know my neighbor is supposed to be there and for some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=12598)|
| 3:30:01| reason they're not there or there's something that goes on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=12601)|
| 3:30:04| I can contact that person right away through that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=12604)|
| 3:30:07| And so what we're saying is what we're asking for is that in that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=12607)|
| 3:30:11| particular situation that the owner be required to be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=12611)|
| 3:30:14| Yeah, now are you going to go around all over town looking to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=12614)|
| 3:30:17| see if those owners are there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=12617)|
| 3:30:18| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=12618)|
| 3:30:19| But if it should happen that I as a neighbor want to contact that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=12619)|
| 3:30:23| person and they're not there, then I can file a complaint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=12623)|
| 3:30:28| That's true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=12628)|
| 3:30:31| I'm not trying to be smart, but I don't know how I would verify| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=12631)|
| 3:30:36| that after the fact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=12636)|
| 3:30:43| Jesse?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=12643)|
| 3:30:46| Jesse Mayshark, Director of Communications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=12646)|
| 3:30:48| I just, because this issue has come up a couple of times,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=12648)|
| 3:30:51| and I think one thing to keep in mind, as we said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=12651)|
| 3:30:54| we want an ordinance that we can enforce.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=12654)|
| 3:30:56| And I think one thing to think about is the form of that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=12656)|
| 3:30:59| enforcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=12659)|
| 3:31:00| And for something like this, I'm not quite sure which city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=12660)|
| 3:31:05| official, whether that's a police officer or somebody working late| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=12665)|
| 3:31:09| night overtime in Peter's department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=12669)|
| 3:31:11| is the one who shows up at the house and knocks on the door to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=12671)|
| 3:31:15| check if the owner is home, which department we're going to put| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=12675)|
| 3:31:19| that responsibility on, and just whether that is the kind of city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=12679)|
| 3:31:24| that we want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=12684)|
| 3:31:25| So I think when you talk about these kinds of things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=12685)|
| 3:31:28| it's important to think about the form that that enforcement is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=12688)|
| 3:31:31| going to take.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=12691)|
| 3:31:32| On the other hand, would you clarify what is required in terms of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=12692)|
| 3:31:35| there's a backup person?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=12695)|
| 3:31:38| Well, so in the proposed ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=12698)|
| 3:31:41| every applicant has to include a local contact name and phone number,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=12701)|
| 3:31:46| email address, and address of somebody who will be the responsive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=12706)|
| 3:31:51| person if the owner happens to be out of town or otherwise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=12711)|
| 3:31:55| unavailable at a time that somebody raises an issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=12715)|
| 3:32:00| One other thing I'll throw out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=12720)|
| 3:32:02| because this hasn't really come up and this is not in the ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=12722)|
| 3:32:06| but there is the possibility of a 24-hour hotline,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=12726)|
| 3:32:11| the enforcement software that we've talked about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=12731)|
| 3:32:13| that we've looked at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=12733)|
| 3:32:14| And we haven't presented this yet because we haven't contracted with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=12734)|
| 3:32:18| this vendor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=12738)|
| 3:32:19| We would have to do an RFP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=12739)|
| 3:32:21| We have to do all of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=12741)|
| 3:32:23| But at least one vendor does offer a 24-hour hotline with a number| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=12743)|
| 3:32:28| that is staffed by a real person who has access to all of the city's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=12748)|
| 3:32:32| short-term rental information and all of the contact numbers and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=12752)|
| 3:32:35| everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=12755)|
| 3:32:36| And that's available for a surcharge on the basic contract with that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=12756)|
| 3:32:40| particular company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=12760)|
| 3:32:42| If that's something that council members are interested in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=12762)|
| 3:32:44| certainly when we issue that RFP,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=12764)|
| 3:32:47| we could include that as something that we're looking for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=12767)|
| 3:32:50| So there may be ways to get to what you're looking for where you have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=12770)|
| 3:32:53| that kind of immediate responsiveness that doesn't put us in the position| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=12773)|
| 3:32:57| of trying to go and find out who's home at certain times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=12777)|
| 3:33:02| Councilwoman Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=12782)|
| 3:33:05| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=12785)|
| 3:33:07| I'm really concerned about these amendments that have come up and some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=12787)|
| 3:33:10| other things that have come before this council as far as enforcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=12790)|
| 3:33:15| We seem to do a really good job of making rules and not thinking about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=12795)|
| 3:33:19| who's going to enforce it, how much that's going to cost,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=12799)|
| 3:33:23| will we need additional personnel to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=12803)|
| 3:33:26| And, Mr. Ahrens, I respect your saying, I have no idea,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=12806)|
| 3:33:30| because we're not going to knock on doors at night and see if the owner is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=12810)|
| 3:33:33| there, and that just is not something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=12813)|
| 3:33:36| We have another ordinance in the city that's on the books,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=12816)|
| 3:33:39| and it's really pretty much unenforceable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=12819)|
| 3:33:41| and that is a maximum number of people who can live in a house or a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=12821)|
| 3:33:45| residence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=12825)|
| 3:33:47| So inspections go out and say, well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=12827)|
| 3:33:49| we have been told that there are nine people living here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=12829)|
| 3:33:52| Oh, well, those are my relatives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=12832)|
| 3:33:54| They're just here for three or four weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=12834)|
| 3:33:57| Something happened to their house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=12837)|
| 3:33:59| We don't need to be in that part of the business of enforcement at all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=12839)|
| 3:34:05| and this council and the one to come behind us needs to really think about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=12845)|
| 3:34:09| that as we're passing ordinances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=12849)|
| 3:34:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=12853)|
| 3:34:14| Are you waiting to speak again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=12854)|
| 3:34:16| I guess I want to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=12856)|
| 3:34:18| You know, I'm concerned that every time someone tries to put a limit on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=12858)|
| 3:34:27| transients coming into the neighborhood to hoot and holler for a weekend,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=12867)|
| 3:34:32| that there's, oh, this is just part of the residential estate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=12872)|
| 3:34:36| We can't enforce it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=12876)|
| 3:34:37| We've had 300 violations, according to your own testimony here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=12877)|
| 3:34:41| that Peter Ahrens has never enforced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=12881)|
| 3:34:44| So the idea of what's enforceable and not is a little bit of a make-wait.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=12884)|
| 3:34:48| The reality is we only wait for a complaint,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=12888)|
| 3:34:51| and even then we're not sure what we're going to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=12891)|
| 3:34:54| We hope to hire someone who's going to give us some software that will say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=12894)|
| 3:34:58| where people are doing an end run, but I'm not sure what the enforcement is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=12898)|
| 3:35:03| The reality is this stuff is going to happen on Friday night and on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=12903)|
| 3:35:06| weekend, and Peter and his crew is going to be home at sleep,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=12906)|
| 3:35:10| where they need to be, and watch football games or baseball games| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=12910)|
| 3:35:13| or whatever they're watching.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=12913)|
| 3:35:14| The level of enforcement is limited, but if our goal is to try to keep the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=12914)|
| 3:35:20| integrity of residential neighborhoods, then there needs to be some limits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=12920)|
| 3:35:25| and maybe we can debate until the cows come home what the exact number is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=12925)|
| 3:35:30| But this proposal, okay, maybe it's awkward in terms of enforcement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=12930)|
| 3:35:36| says, look, we want you to have the ability to have a short-term rental,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=12936)|
| 3:35:40| run a little motel on the side in your house, but keep it to eight people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=12940)|
| 3:35:45| or less, and by God, be there to keep the place in order,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=12945)|
| 3:35:50| or I suppose get this representative down the block to come babysit with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=12950)|
| 3:35:55| But that's the request here that he's making, which is let's have some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=12955)|
| 3:36:00| reasonable controls over what happens in neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=12960)|
| 3:36:04| If you don't want to do that, man, let them run wild.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=12964)|
| 3:36:07| I don't know, but that's the objective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=12967)|
| 3:36:09| And to say, oh, it's enforcement, we may have to hire three or four enforcement people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=12969)|
| 3:36:15| We may have to have people on call on weekends.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=12975)|
| 3:36:17| That's going to be the reality once you let a commercial business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=12977)|
| 3:36:21| which is what this is, this is what the state attorney general said, it's a hotel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=12981)|
| 3:36:25| This is a hotel in a neighborhood where it's supposed to be residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=12985)|
| 3:36:29| but it's a business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=12989)|
| 3:36:30| How do we control that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=12990)|
| 3:36:32| By some limits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=12992)|
| 3:36:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=12994)|
| 3:36:35| We have a motion and a second to require the owner of a Type I owner-occupied operating permit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=12995)|
| 3:36:41| to require them to remain on site during the stay of the transients.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=13001)|
| 3:36:46| Okay, are you all ready to vote on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=13006)|
| 3:36:48| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=13008)|
| 3:36:49| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=13009)|
| 3:36:50| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=13010)|
| 3:36:53| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=13013)|
| 3:36:55| Opposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=13015)|
| 3:36:58| So there were only two ayes, is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=13018)|
| 3:37:01| All right, so it fails two to six.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=13021)|
| 3:37:04| I'm sorry, two to seven, huh?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=13024)|
| 3:37:05| Two to seven.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=13025)|
| 3:37:07| Dave and Della voted aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=13027)|
| 3:37:09| Everybody else, so two to seven.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=13029)|
| 3:37:12| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=13032)|
| 3:37:14| You have to hold your applause.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=13034)|
| 3:37:15| You can't hear the results.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=13035)|
| 3:37:17| Okay, two to seven.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=13037)|
| 3:37:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=13040)|
| 3:37:21| Let's move on to number four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=13041)|
| 3:37:22| Number four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=13042)|
| 3:37:24| I move to amend Division IV operational requirements to add a new section, 4.4,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=13044)|
| 3:37:29| entitled Parking Requirements, to add specifications for parking as follows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=13049)|
| 3:37:34| Parking requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=13054)|
| 3:37:35| If off-street parking exists at the short-term rental unit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=13055)|
| 3:37:38| it shall be used by the owner in all transients for parking vehicles during the occupancy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=13058)|
| 3:37:46| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=13066)|
| 3:37:48| Say now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=13068)|
| 3:37:49| In the yard?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=13069)|
| 3:37:51| Building?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=13071)|
| 3:37:53| You can't park in the yard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=13073)|
| 3:37:54| You can't park on the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=13074)|
| 3:37:55| Is that what you're saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=13075)|
| 3:37:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=13076)|
| 3:37:57| It's if they're available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=13077)|
| 3:37:59| If there's off-street parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=13079)|
| 3:38:02| No second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=13082)|
| 3:38:05| There's no second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=13085)|
| 3:38:07| Okay, there's no second, so that fails for lack of a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=13087)|
| 3:38:11| So we failed on parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=13091)|
| 3:38:13| Okay, the next one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=13093)|
| 3:38:16| I move to amend Division II permit types application and insurance at Section 2.2,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=13096)|
| 3:38:22| to add a new section, 2.2H, entitled Required Notification for Type I Operating Permits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=13102)|
| 3:38:29| which imposes notification requirements to certain neighbors as follows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=13109)|
| 3:38:35| And this is one that we, the administration and myself, we have discussed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=13115)|
| 3:38:41| and so let me read what it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=13121)|
| 3:38:44| Required Notification for Type I Operating Permits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=13124)|
| 3:38:47| The owner shall provide notice of their application for a Type I Operating Permit in the following ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=13127)|
| 3:38:53| By mail, within 48 hours of submitting the application for a Type I Operating Permit to the business license| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=13133)|
| 3:39:00| and tax office, the owner shall send a neighborhood notice form supplied by the business license| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=13140)|
| 3:39:05| and tax office by first-class mail to the neighborhood association, if applicable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=13145)|
| 3:39:10| and all property owners whose property is adjacent to the property at which the short-term rental unit is proposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=13150)|
| 3:39:18| And then by signage, within 72 hours of submitting the application for a Type I Operating Permit to the business license| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=13158)|
| 3:39:25| and tax office, the owner shall post a notification sign supplied by the business license and tax office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=13165)|
| 3:39:31| in a conspicuous location in the front yard of the proposed short-term rental unit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=13171)|
| 3:39:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=13180)|
| 3:39:41| So you're saying tell the neighbors?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=13181)|
| 3:39:42| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=13182)|
| 3:39:43| Let the neighbors know and let the neighborhood association know and post the sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=13183)|
| 3:39:46| Is there a second to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=13186)|
| 3:39:50| Well, I'm not sure of the time periods and stuff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=13190)|
| 3:39:54| but I'll second the idea that he's saying the people that are adjacent to this now house| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=13194)|
| 3:39:59| that has a rental unit in it should notify those neighbors, right, the next-door neighbors?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=13199)|
| 3:40:05| And I think, Jesse, if you'll comment on that in terms of what Portland does, I would appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=13205)|
| 3:40:12| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=13212)|
| 3:40:13| We did, after Vice Mayor Grieve talked about this idea, we looked for other models of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=13213)|
| 3:40:21| and Portland, Oregon, does have a neighbor notification requirement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=13221)|
| 3:40:25| which I provided to Vice Mayor Grieve and to Rob Frost to look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=13225)|
| 3:40:31| It's pretty clear and straightforward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=13231)|
| 3:40:33| The city provides a form letter, and it gives you a little map saying here's all the other property owners you have to notify.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=13233)|
| 3:40:42| And they also do have, I don't think they have a sign requirement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=13242)|
| 3:40:46| but they do require that you notify the neighborhood association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=13246)|
| 3:40:50| So that's a model that we found.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=13250)|
| 3:40:53| It seems pretty straightforward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=13253)|
| 3:40:56| It's not something, frankly, that a lot of other cities do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=13256)|
| 3:41:00| No other city in Tennessee does it that I know of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=13260)|
| 3:41:02| Chattanooga has a requirement, but that's only for non-owner-occupied properties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=13262)|
| 3:41:06| and residential neighborhoods, which, of course, we're not even talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=13266)|
| 3:41:11| So, yeah, there is a model there that Portland's been using for at least a few years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=13271)|
| 3:41:16| But you're saying subpart I, that subpart I is the part that Oregon does tell the neighbors and the neighborhood group?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=13276)|
| 3:41:25| The neighbor notification, yeah, with a letter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=13285)|
| 3:41:27| As opposed to a sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=13287)|
| 3:41:28| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=13288)|
| 3:41:29| They don't have a requirement for a sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=13289)|
| 3:41:31| And I have a question about how long is a sign supposed to be up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=13291)|
| 3:41:35| I had not thought about that previously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=13295)|
| 3:41:40| I'll limit my second to notifying the neighbors and the association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=13300)|
| 3:41:43| I think that seems healthy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=13303)|
| 3:41:46| I'll second that, Nick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=13306)|
| 3:41:47| So I, but not to I.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=13307)|
| 3:41:50| How do we do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=13310)|
| 3:41:51| Okay, legally, let's just think about this for a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=13311)|
| 3:41:53| Can I redo the motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=13313)|
| 3:41:56| Let me break the motion apart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=13316)|
| 3:41:57| Okay, you're going to break the motion, so we'll pull all that back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=13317)|
| 3:41:59| You're going to first make a motion for I, which is to notify by mail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=13319)|
| 3:42:03| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=13323)|
| 3:42:04| And, Councilman Del Volfo, you second that one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=13324)|
| 3:42:07| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=13327)|
| 3:42:08| Okay, so right now we're just voting on the notification requirement by mail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=13328)|
| 3:42:14| Councilman Saunders, do you have a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=13334)|
| 3:42:16| No, just a comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=13336)|
| 3:42:20| This gets to the comments I made earlier when we sent this back to MPC last time about setting some standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=13340)|
| 3:42:26| And I like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=13346)|
| 3:42:28| I have some reluctance to codify it, but I do think it needs to be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=13348)|
| 3:42:33| We're not asking the neighbors to vote on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=13353)|
| 3:42:36| We're just simply notifying them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=13356)|
| 3:42:38| And I think that's the thing you do anyhow as a neighbor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=13358)|
| 3:42:42| You don't just do something that, you know, that might impact your neighbor without mentioning it to your neighbor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=13362)|
| 3:42:48| And I think that's just part of the standard that we should expect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=13368)|
| 3:42:51| So I have kind of mixed emotions about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=13371)|
| 3:42:58| We'll give you a second to decide how you're going to vote, Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=13378)|
| 3:43:02| I will support that because I think it's something that neighbors have asked for as a reasonable notification,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=13382)|
| 3:43:08| that they ought to be notified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=13388)|
| 3:43:10| And I think that's reasonable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=13390)|
| 3:43:11| A first-class letter is reasonable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=13391)|
| 3:43:13| And I will support the first one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=13393)|
| 3:43:18| Councilman Palmer, did you still want to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=13398)|
| 3:43:20| No, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=13400)|
| 3:43:21| Okay, any other discussion on the amendment to notify within 48 hours?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=13401)|
| 3:43:28| That's just the one piece of it, notification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=13408)|
| 3:43:31| Ready to vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=13411)|
| 3:43:32| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=13412)|
| 3:43:33| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=13413)|
| 3:43:34| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=13414)|
| 3:43:35| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=13415)|
| 3:43:36| We're going to need a roll call on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=13416)|
| 3:43:38| I can't figure that one out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=13418)|
| 3:43:39| Councilman Brown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=13419)|
| 3:43:40| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=13420)|
| 3:43:41| Councilman Campin?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=13421)|
| 3:43:42| Nay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=13422)|
| 3:43:43| Councilman De La Volpe?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=13423)|
| 3:43:44| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=13424)|
| 3:43:45| Councilman, excuse me, Vice Mayor Grieve?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=13425)|
| 3:43:46| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=13426)|
| 3:43:47| Councilwoman Palmer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=13427)|
| 3:43:48| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=13428)|
| 3:43:49| Councilman Pavlis?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=13429)|
| 3:43:50| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=13430)|
| 3:43:51| Councilman Saunders?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=13431)|
| 3:43:52| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=13432)|
| 3:43:53| Councilman Starr?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=13433)|
| 3:43:54| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=13434)|
| 3:43:55| Councilman Wallace?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=13435)|
| 3:43:56| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=13436)|
| 3:43:58| Okay, the motion fails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=13438)|
| 3:44:01| That's four to five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=13441)|
| 3:44:07| You want to try the next one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=13447)|
| 3:44:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=13452)|
| 3:44:13| See if you can find your friend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=13453)|
| 3:44:14| You're on a roll, actually, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=13454)|
| 3:44:15| That's not the way you're going to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=13455)|
| 3:44:16| You're on a roll.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=13456)|
| 3:44:17| I hope I have some friends out there somewhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=13457)|
| 3:44:19| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=13459)|
| 3:44:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=13460)|
| 3:44:21| It's dealing with a sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=13461)|
| 3:44:22| You could create a task force for that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=13462)|
| 3:44:23| Oh, yeah, the sign, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=13463)|
| 3:44:26| I do want to ask, Mayor, since all my motions went through so strongly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=13466)|
| 3:44:30| is there a reason for this temporary sign?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=13470)|
| 3:44:36| I noticed that when I came in, but I have nothing to do with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=13476)|
| 3:44:39| Are you sure?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=13479)|
| 3:44:40| Yeah, that's...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=13480)|
| 3:44:43| You'll find out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=13483)|
| 3:44:45| Next meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=13485)|
| 3:44:46| That's what he's afraid of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=13486)|
| 3:44:47| Find out next meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=13487)|
| 3:44:48| Stay tuned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=13488)|
| 3:44:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=13489)|
| 3:44:50| It's only there for 48 hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=13490)|
| 3:44:51| I mean, I want you to notice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=13491)|
| 3:44:52| You're not going to make your...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=13492)|
| 3:44:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=13493)|
| 3:44:54| Is there any other...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=13494)|
| 3:44:55| Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=13495)|
| 3:44:56| Yeah, absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=13496)|
| 3:44:57| Well, let's talk about...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=13497)|
| 3:44:58| You'll have to vote on all of it, on the original motion, as we've just...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=13498)|
| 3:45:03| Actually, we didn't amend it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=13503)|
| 3:45:04| We did...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=13504)|
| 3:45:05| It's never been amended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=13505)|
| 3:45:06| It's not been amended at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=13506)|
| 3:45:07| So, we have to vote back on the original motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=13507)|
| 3:45:10| Nick, do you want to talk about sunsetting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=13510)|
| 3:45:12| I'm glad to...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=13512)|
| 3:45:13| Well, I mean, I'll call on Mr. Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=13513)|
| 3:45:15| I mean, it's my understanding, if the ordinance would pass as presented,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=13515)|
| 3:45:20| that that would be a moot point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=13520)|
| 3:45:24| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=13524)|
| 3:45:25| That's what...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=13525)|
| 3:45:26| Yeah, there...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=13526)|
| 3:45:29| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=13529)|
| 3:45:30| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=13530)|
| 3:45:31| I mean, if...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=13531)|
| 3:45:34| It's not a real solid yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=13534)|
| 3:45:36| No, no, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=13536)|
| 3:45:37| If Mr. Green's first proposed amendment to exclude R1 and R1E zones had passed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=13537)|
| 3:45:43| and you were wanting to allow the continuance of those that are presently in use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=13543)|
| 3:45:49| then you would need to discuss it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=13549)|
| 3:45:51| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=13551)|
| 3:45:52| But because it did not pass, I don't think you need to bring it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=13552)|
| 3:45:58| We're talking about the ones that are operating now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=13558)|
| 3:46:00| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=13560)|
| 3:46:01| That are...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=13561)|
| 3:46:04| They file for a permit like everybody else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=13564)|
| 3:46:06| Non-owner-occupied that are operating now, that we're saying are going to be illegal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=13566)|
| 3:46:12| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=13572)|
| 3:46:13| The non-owner-occupied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=13573)|
| 3:46:14| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=13574)|
| 3:46:15| So, we're talking about non-owner-occupied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=13575)|
| 3:46:16| So, I think we...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=13576)|
| 3:46:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=13577)|
| 3:46:18| I'm willing to propose an amendment for non-owner-occupied| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=13578)|
| 3:46:21| that are in existing operation now for a period of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=13581)|
| 3:46:26| We've got to be able to identify them in a clear way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=13586)|
| 3:46:29| and we have to give them a reasonable period of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=13589)|
| 3:46:31| And I would propose that we give them...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=13591)|
| 3:46:33| They have 12 months, or pick a number, but I think...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=13593)|
| 3:46:37| And they need a reasonable period of time to unwind their operation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=13597)|
| 3:46:40| You're saying the law violators get special treatment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=13600)|
| 3:46:45| Why don't they apply for a permit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=13605)|
| 3:46:46| If they qualify under the terms, they get one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=13606)|
| 3:46:49| If they don't, they don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=13609)|
| 3:46:51| We're making rules here for a permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=13611)|
| 3:46:54| Why does someone who jumps the gun and violates the law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=13614)|
| 3:46:58| until he can get away with it and make a few bucks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=13618)|
| 3:47:00| all of a sudden get special treatment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=13620)|
| 3:47:02| Because it was passively permitted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=13622)|
| 3:47:04| That's why.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=13624)|
| 3:47:05| I mean, we have passively permitted this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=13625)|
| 3:47:07| As the gentleman stood up there before and said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=13627)|
| 3:47:09| I just assumed they were all out there, so I got in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=13629)|
| 3:47:12| Well, you know what happens when you assume you make an ass out of you and me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=13632)|
| 3:47:15| What's that got to do with it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=13635)|
| 3:47:16| Well, this is a yes or no vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=13636)|
| 3:47:17| It's a moral hazard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=13637)|
| 3:47:18| You're teaching everyone, every time this council takes up an issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=13638)|
| 3:47:21| whether it's signs or something else,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=13641)|
| 3:47:23| jump the gun and get in there and get special treatment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=13643)|
| 3:47:27| That's crazy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=13647)|
| 3:47:28| That's bad precedent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=13648)|
| 3:47:30| That's bad government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=13650)|
| 3:47:31| I'd like to call the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=13651)|
| 3:47:33| I'm tired of the yelling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=13653)|
| 3:47:34| Okay, so we have a...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=13654)|
| 3:47:35| Say, what more from our lawyers, what more do we need on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=13655)|
| 3:47:39| The motion is for non-owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=13659)|
| 3:47:41| Is that what you mean?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=13661)|
| 3:47:42| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=13662)|
| 3:47:43| We've got this motion still.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=13663)|
| 3:47:44| In residential zones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=13664)|
| 3:47:46| In residential zones, your non-owner occupant that have been operating,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=13666)|
| 3:47:50| that they have 12 months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=13670)|
| 3:47:52| We'd have to...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=13672)|
| 3:47:53| Residential zones are all non-owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=13673)|
| 3:47:55| Oh, that's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=13675)|
| 3:47:56| It only affects residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=13676)|
| 3:47:57| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=13677)|
| 3:47:58| So non-owner occupied in residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=13678)|
| 3:48:00| That have been operating,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=13680)|
| 3:48:01| that now will be illegal under this new ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=13681)|
| 3:48:04| that they will have 12 months to unwind their operation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=13684)|
| 3:48:07| cease and desist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=13687)|
| 3:48:09| So what you're proposing is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=13689)|
| 3:48:11| allow those individuals to get a 12-month long permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=13691)|
| 3:48:14| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=13694)|
| 3:48:15| Well, I'm assuming they have bookings or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=13695)|
| 3:48:19| They have investments in their property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=13699)|
| 3:48:21| They have an opportunity to get out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=13701)|
| 3:48:23| George, can I ask you a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=13703)|
| 3:48:26| Are you saying that, like, the individual that has four houses now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=13706)|
| 3:48:30| and he's operating supposedly illegally,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=13710)|
| 3:48:35| we're going to allow him to continue for 12 months?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=13715)|
| 3:48:38| He has a period of time to get out, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=13718)|
| 3:48:40| He's got to wind it down and get out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=13720)|
| 3:48:42| He can get a permit for his one and his other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=13722)|
| 3:48:44| He can get a permit for two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=13724)|
| 3:48:46| The ones that will be declared illegal at the end of this vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=13726)|
| 3:48:51| Those are the ones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=13731)|
| 3:48:53| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=13733)|
| 3:48:54| And I think what staff has talked about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=13734)|
| 3:48:56| we want them to then, if this does pass, if that's your desire,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=13736)|
| 3:49:01| that we would want them to get a 12-month permit then,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=13741)|
| 3:49:04| so that we actually know who they are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=13744)|
| 3:49:06| because we're going to start tracking through our special software| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=13746)|
| 3:49:10| and all of the owner-occupied, I mean, all of the STRs, sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=13750)|
| 3:49:15| And so we'll want them to be required to get a permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=13755)|
| 3:49:20| They'll have 12.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=13760)|
| 3:49:21| It'll be a 12-month permit, and that allows them to unwind,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=13761)|
| 3:49:24| but we also know who they are and that they're following all the regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=13764)|
| 3:49:28| Well, so when we say unwind,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=13768)|
| 3:49:30| you're talking about they've got a year to operate and then they're shut down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=13770)|
| 3:49:34| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=13774)|
| 3:49:36| Well, that's not what I was talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=13776)|
| 3:49:39| Oh, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=13779)|
| 3:49:41| Certainly wasn't what I was talking about at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=13781)|
| 3:49:44| Well, I mean, you know, with all due respect to Councilman Della Voppe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=13784)|
| 3:49:48| I don't want to get cursed at too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=13788)|
| 3:49:50| but I still think that the folks that have come up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=13790)|
| 3:49:56| have made significant investment, and I agree with you, Councilman Wallace,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=13796)|
| 3:50:01| and it was passive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=13801)|
| 3:50:03| All of us up here practically could have done something about the ones that operated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=13803)|
| 3:50:09| and we just didn't, so I don't want to point fingers at people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=13809)|
| 3:50:12| But there has been substantial investment made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=13812)|
| 3:50:15| They have not been troublesome to date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=13815)|
| 3:50:19| I mean, there may have been a complaint or two,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=13819)|
| 3:50:21| but I heard five thrown out or whatever it was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=13821)|
| 3:50:24| But they still have improved the property values.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=13824)|
| 3:50:27| They've been good operators.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=13827)|
| 3:50:29| So why do we want to take that down?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=13829)|
| 3:50:32| Why do we want to punish them and say after a year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=13832)|
| 3:50:37| I mean, we heard the stories.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=13837)|
| 3:50:39| I mean, it's a life changer for people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=13839)|
| 3:50:42| A lot of people have invested their savings or whatever to get these up and going,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=13842)|
| 3:50:46| and I just can't see just taking them down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=13846)|
| 3:50:51| You want to amend the motion for 12 months to make it a lifetime,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=13851)|
| 3:50:54| or as long as they own the property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=13854)|
| 3:50:55| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=13855)|
| 3:50:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=13856)|
| 3:50:57| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=13857)|
| 3:50:59| Which part is this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=13859)|
| 3:51:00| Forever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=13860)|
| 3:51:01| Forever?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=13861)|
| 3:51:02| For their lifetime.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=13862)|
| 3:51:03| As long as they own the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=13863)|
| 3:51:04| As long as the property is in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=13864)|
| 3:51:07| Why have rules?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=13867)|
| 3:51:09| You know, I don't know, Nick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=13869)|
| 3:51:11| I just, you know, I've got an opinion, you've got an opinion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=13871)|
| 3:51:14| and, you know, you vote and I'll vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=13874)|
| 3:51:18| Good news is it will be replaced soon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=13878)|
| 3:51:20| Parliamentary procedure here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=13880)|
| 3:51:21| Where is this in the ordinance that we're talking about?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=13881)|
| 3:51:24| It's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=13884)|
| 3:51:25| It's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=13885)|
| 3:51:26| It's just an amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=13886)|
| 3:51:28| What we would have to do if you all passed this is the law would bring it back in the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=13888)|
| 3:51:32| in what we believe the form is that you're requesting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=13892)|
| 3:51:36| And we'll share that with you, obviously, and then you'd vote on it again in two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=13896)|
| 3:51:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=13900)|
| 3:51:41| Well, I'll amend my motion to what Nick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=13901)|
| 3:51:43| I'll go with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=13903)|
| 3:51:44| Let's vote on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=13904)|
| 3:51:45| I'll amend my motion to say that the people that are operating,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=13905)|
| 3:51:49| that have been operating non-owner occupant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=13909)|
| 3:51:53| then they will have to identify who they are and that for as long as they own the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=13913)|
| 3:51:59| their property remains as in their current ownership,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=13919)|
| 3:52:02| then they would be able to operate that short-term rental.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=13922)|
| 3:52:06| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=13926)|
| 3:52:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=13927)|
| 3:52:08| That's the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=13928)|
| 3:52:09| If you want to second it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=13929)|
| 3:52:10| So they put it in their two-year-old kid's name?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=13930)|
| 3:52:13| Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=13933)|
| 3:52:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=13934)|
| 3:52:15| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=13935)|
| 3:52:16| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=13936)|
| 3:52:17| I guess I'd just ask the opinion of the administration or law department or, I don't know, Dr. Lyons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=13937)|
| 3:52:28| Well, we have not, we have not supported,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=13948)|
| 3:52:32| but we thought one option might be the phase-out where we started this discussion to allow a one-year permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=13952)|
| 3:52:38| I think philosophically, obviously,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=13958)|
| 3:52:39| we have trouble with basically grandfathering something that was illegal at the time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=13959)|
| 3:52:45| that was outside the law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=13965)|
| 3:52:46| That, I think, would be our approach to it, and I'll let others address that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=13966)|
| 3:52:51| I don't know, Kristen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=13971)|
| 3:52:52| How one actually does do that was something that was outside the permitted use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=13972)|
| 3:52:58| Well, hold on here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=13978)|
| 3:53:00| I mean, are they really illegal or just out of compliance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=13980)|
| 3:53:03| I mean, they're not criminals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=13983)|
| 3:53:04| And when I hear illegal, that makes me go to the, you know, it's a whole different meaning to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=13984)|
| 3:53:09| You like unlawful better?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=13989)|
| 3:53:10| Out of compliance, perhaps, but I don't like the illegal part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=13990)|
| 3:53:17| How would that be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=13997)|
| 3:53:18| Let me ask this from the law department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=13998)|
| 3:53:21| How would that be structured if you technically can't grandfather in something that wasn't a legally used permit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=14001)|
| 3:53:29| How would that be worded?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=14009)|
| 3:53:30| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=14010)|
| 3:53:31| Okay, how would that be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=14011)|
| 3:53:32| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=14012)|
| 3:53:33| Well, I know that this was an idea that had come up in prior iterations of the ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=14013)|
| 3:53:39| and when we were discussing it, we had proposed creating a type 3 permit, which would be a type 3 permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=14019)|
| 3:53:49| So right now we have the type 1 and the type 2,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=14029)|
| 3:53:51| so adding a type 3 that would be non-owner-occupied and residential districts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=14031)|
| 3:53:56| and then adding the restrictions there that it could only be available for a year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=14036)|
| 3:54:01| or whatever it is that council would decide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=14041)|
| 3:54:04| From a legal perspective and from an administrative perspective,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=14044)|
| 3:54:09| I do have concerns about having it be for the life of the owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=14049)|
| 3:54:16| I think that that's going to be really challenging for us to enforce,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=14056)|
| 3:54:19| and I think we'll run into a lot of problems that we can't even predict at this point with that particular provision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=14059)|
| 3:54:29| So that's my perspective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=14069)|
| 3:54:31| I think you've got an equal protection problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=14071)|
| 3:54:33| Different people can do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=14073)|
| 3:54:34| If I may, since my light's on, could you just give me a specific?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=14074)|
| 3:54:39| I mean, I hear you saying it will cause trouble.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=14079)|
| 3:54:44| Right, so keeping track of the property owners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=14084)|
| 3:54:47| So if property changes hands, we're not necessarily going to know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=14087)|
| 3:54:54| No, what I'm suggesting is that if it did change hands, it reverts back,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=14094)|
| 3:55:00| that the permit would not be good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=14100)|
| 3:55:06| Right, they lose their permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=14106)|
| 3:55:08| It just automatically terminates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=14108)|
| 3:55:11| And it would revert to whatever we pass, just those properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=14111)|
| 3:55:17| Right, so long as that person owned the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=14117)|
| 3:55:21| They have to renew it every year, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=14121)|
| 3:55:22| So every year you have to renew it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=14122)|
| 3:55:25| Obstensibly, I think that's what you all are leaning towards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=14125)|
| 3:55:29| So you're talking about a type three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=14129)|
| 3:55:31| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=14131)|
| 3:55:33| But I do think property could change hands without us knowing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=14133)|
| 3:55:39| and even with the annual renewal, there would be instances or periods of time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=14139)|
| 3:55:44| which could be up to a year, where we wouldn't know that the property had changed hands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=14144)|
| 3:55:50| And then I think it would just be hard for us to keep track of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=14150)|
| 3:55:55| Well, if I could, and I don't want to be argumentative with you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=14155)|
| 3:55:59| but it would be a lot easier to track a transfer of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=14159)|
| 3:56:05| I mean, there's things in place already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=14165)|
| 3:56:09| So, I mean, to me, though you may have to go track it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=14169)|
| 3:56:13| but it seems like there may be a way electronically to flag that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=14173)|
| 3:56:19| And I don't know if there is or isn't, but I think there is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=14179)|
| 3:56:22| And, you know, it's public knowledge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=14182)|
| 3:56:24| It's public record when properties change hands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=14184)|
| 3:56:27| So though it may be the same thing, somebody's got to look after that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=14187)|
| 3:56:32| But I think that we've got to look at the volume, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=14192)|
| 3:56:37| I don't think the volume, and I don't know what the number is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=14197)|
| 3:56:39| Even if it's 200, then, you know, though it may be a little burdensome, but that's not unachievable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=14199)|
| 3:56:48| Can I make a suggestion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=14208)|
| 3:56:51| Instead of dealing with this particular part of the issue right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=14211)|
| 3:56:54| which I do think needs to be dealt with, I don't think there's any question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=14214)|
| 3:56:57| could we not address the ordinance as amended, as not amended,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=14217)|
| 3:57:06| and then address this as a second next time and ask them to come back with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=14226)|
| 3:57:12| we don't even know what the extent of the situation is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=14232)|
| 3:57:15| When you say?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=14235)|
| 3:57:17| Ask the law department to come back and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=14237)|
| 3:57:19| okay, here are how many that would fall into the category we're talking about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=14239)|
| 3:57:22| and then let's address that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=14242)|
| 3:57:24| Because I agree we need to have some consideration given to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=14244)|
| 3:57:29| So we're talking about next, you're talking about in two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=14249)|
| 3:57:31| Right, but it would be a different ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=14251)|
| 3:57:35| You hear what I'm saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=14255)|
| 3:57:36| Instead of amending this ordinance, let's just deal with that separately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=14256)|
| 3:57:42| Well, I mean, is there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=14262)|
| 3:57:44| The other option is that you've talked about it here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=14264)|
| 3:57:48| You could bring it back and then pass the whole ordinance on emergency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=14268)|
| 3:57:53| I would like to know, what is the extent of the situation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=14273)|
| 3:58:00| I think it's reasonable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=14280)|
| 3:58:02| Mr. Frommly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=14282)|
| 3:58:04| Mr. Frommly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=14284)|
| 3:58:05| Just for someone who will probably be working on it, looking for a little guidance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=14285)|
| 3:58:12| I mean, so you have two people owning a piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=14292)|
| 3:58:15| What happens if death, divorce, at what point is that going to trigger loss of that permit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=14295)|
| 3:58:25| Well, if the surviving and or the spouse is still dealing with the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=14305)|
| 3:58:36| they're still owners of that property, still have the deed to that property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=14316)|
| 3:58:40| then the deed's, you know, it's still good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=14320)|
| 3:58:43| But if it goes, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=14323)|
| 3:58:45| If, say, four people own a piece of property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=14325)|
| 3:58:48| and one person sells their interest to another person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=14328)|
| 3:58:53| That person, the four people would be on the deed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=14333)|
| 3:58:57| The four people would be on the deed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=14337)|
| 3:58:59| And if violated, just make it simple.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=14339)|
| 3:59:00| You transfer it, it's over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=14340)|
| 3:59:02| I mean, make it easy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=14342)|
| 3:59:04| Any change in ownership?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=14344)|
| 3:59:07| Could that be part of what we talk about in the third point?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=14347)|
| 3:59:10| It could, but we need a little.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=14350)|
| 3:59:13| How many permutations do we need to draft?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=14353)|
| 3:59:18| Well, you tell me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=14358)|
| 3:59:19| You're the lawyer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=14359)|
| 3:59:22| Phil Cable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=14362)|
| 3:59:27| Oh, it's getting late.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=14367)|
| 3:59:32| By the way, we have a new city council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=14372)|
| 3:59:35| Oh, who are they?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=14375)|
| 3:59:37| I'm wondering if Mr. Ahrens was wanting to address that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=14377)|
| 3:59:41| Can I make one suggestion, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=14381)|
| 3:59:43| Can we put a sunset in so that I'm not addressing folks two years from now that say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=14383)|
| 3:59:51| I've been running this short-term rental and now there's a complaint against me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=14391)|
| 3:59:56| and now I have to enforce it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=14396)|
| 3:59:58| But if we have a sunset for people to come into compliance with these Type 3s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=14398)|
| 4:00:03| What do you mean a sunset?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=14403)|
| 4:00:06| They've got 12 months to get their Type 3 permit versus –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=14406)|
| 4:00:11| I think that's too long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=14411)|
| 4:00:14| Whatever the timeframe is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=14414)|
| 4:00:17| These are all the kinds of things we need to address and bring it back to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=14417)|
| 4:00:21| Clearly, they would have to get it when everybody else was signing up, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=14421)|
| 4:00:25| They'd have to get it right away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=14425)|
| 4:00:26| But I would like the onus to be on the Type 3 operator| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=14426)|
| 4:00:31| versus on city staff to go track people down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=14431)|
| 4:00:34| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=14434)|
| 4:00:35| I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=14435)|
| 4:00:36| I think they would have to come and as soon as we set this up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=14436)|
| 4:00:40| they are required to get a permit to continue to operate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=14440)|
| 4:00:43| however long it is that y'all eventually vote on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=14443)|
| 4:00:46| And if there's a certain amount of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=14446)|
| 4:00:48| Like a window is what you're describing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=14448)|
| 4:00:50| A window, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=14450)|
| 4:00:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=14451)|
| 4:00:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=14452)|
| 4:00:53| Mayor Brown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=14453)|
| 4:00:54| I think that we all understand the spirit of Councilman Pavlage's amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=14454)|
| 4:01:00| We're getting deep into the wording right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=14460)|
| 4:01:03| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=14463)|
| 4:01:04| But that can just be brought back in two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=14464)|
| 4:01:06| I'll bring it back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=14466)|
| 4:01:07| We understand what he's saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=14467)|
| 4:01:09| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=14469)|
| 4:01:10| I understand we're getting deep, deep, deep in the weeds right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=14470)|
| 4:01:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=14472)|
| 4:01:13| So if we'll work, our staff will work with Ron Frost, with Councilman Pavlage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=14473)|
| 4:01:20| any of the, and we'll make you all aware of what the options are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=14480)|
| 4:01:26| what the proposal is, that would then, if you vote on what we have now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=14486)|
| 4:01:31| then next, in two weeks, then that will be an amendment that you add to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=14491)|
| 4:01:38| It's been vetted here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=14498)|
| 4:01:41| And in order for that, that wouldn't make it a first reading on that, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=14501)|
| 4:01:46| It would still be a second reading as amended?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=14506)|
| 4:01:49| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=14509)|
| 4:01:50| It would be a substantial change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=14510)|
| 4:01:52| So either it would have to go to the last meeting for a second reading,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=14512)|
| 4:01:57| or you could pass it on emergency,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=14517)|
| 4:01:59| and given the number of times everyone has been involved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=14519)|
| 4:02:03| that might be something you want to consider so that it's final| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=14523)|
| 4:02:07| and not one more meeting to come back to for the inevitable that's already been voted on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=14527)|
| 4:02:12| So that would be my recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=14532)|
| 4:02:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=14535)|
| 4:02:16| So we're not going to vote on that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=14536)|
| 4:02:18| That will come back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=14538)|
| 4:02:19| But we do have to vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=14539)|
| 4:02:21| Excuse me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=14541)|
| 4:02:22| I withdrew it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=14542)|
| 4:02:23| Yeah, he withdrew it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=14543)|
| 4:02:24| It's been withdrawn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=14544)|
| 4:02:25| Thank you, Ron.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=14545)|
| 4:02:26| So now we're back on the original motion that has not been amended yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=14546)|
| 4:02:30| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=14550)|
| 4:02:31| Well, I'd like to call the question, but before I call,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=14551)|
| 4:02:33| I mean, I want to call the question, but I also want to make a comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=14553)|
| 4:02:39| Well, you can't call the question a comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=14559)|
| 4:02:42| I'm supposed to make them go ahead and vote, but I'm going to give you the floor again, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=14562)|
| 4:02:46| Do you want to vote and then give me the floor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=14566)|
| 4:02:48| No, no, I want to give you the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=14568)|
| 4:02:49| They're calling for the question, but I'm going to use my prerogative to let you speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=14569)|
| 4:02:52| I really feel that, yeah, we have spent a great deal of time on this ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=14572)|
| 4:02:56| We've spent a great deal of time on dealing with short-term rentals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=14576)|
| 4:03:00| and we're told that there are 300 to 400 of these in this city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=14580)|
| 4:03:04| We have 85,000 residents in this city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=14584)|
| 4:03:07| and I really am disappointed that we don't have any of the amendments that were passed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=14587)|
| 4:03:15| I think that we've said to our neighborhoods that, okay, guys, you're sort of on your own,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=14595)|
| 4:03:21| because as changes come along, we're going to be able to go ahead and make those changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=14601)|
| 4:03:26| I just want to say that I just want to voice my opinion and my disappointment in the fact that this council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=14606)|
| 4:03:32| and administration is going to be responsible for the future of what happens in our neighborhoods,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=14612)|
| 4:03:37| and so I call the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=14617)|
| 4:03:39| Okay, I do want to just add one more piece of that for us, because I know it's been discussed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=14619)|
| 4:03:44| is part of that might also be you had to have been in existence at a certain time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=14624)|
| 4:03:49| so somebody doesn't run out tomorrow to start this, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=14629)|
| 4:03:54| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=14634)|
| 4:03:55| Those have already invested in it, so don't run out tomorrow and buy a place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=14635)|
| 4:03:59| and think it's going to be grandfathered in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=14639)|
| 4:04:02| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=14642)|
| 4:04:03| And do we have record of if they're on the Airbnb or whatever other ones, that's up there now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=14643)|
| 4:04:12| So we would know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=14652)|
| 4:04:13| We have that captured.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=14653)|
| 4:04:14| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=14654)|
| 4:04:15| And Jesse, do you want to talk to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=14655)|
| 4:04:17| You could put in there that they would have to provide evidence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=14657)|
| 4:04:22| which would probably be an Airbnb record of some kind that they'd been operating before a certain date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=14662)|
| 4:04:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=14669)|
| 4:04:31| Now we will vote on the original motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=14671)|
| 4:04:35| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=14675)|
| 4:04:36| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=14676)|
| 4:04:37| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=14677)|
| 4:04:38| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=14678)|
| 4:04:41| The whole thing as presented to us initially.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=14681)|
| 4:04:44| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=14684)|
| 4:04:45| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=14685)|
| 4:04:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=14686)|
| 4:04:47| Did I have three no's?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=14687)|
| 4:04:48| How many no's did I have?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=14688)|
| 4:04:49| Two no's?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=14689)|
| 4:04:50| Two no's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=14690)|
| 4:04:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=14691)|
| 4:04:52| So the original motion passes seven to two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=14692)|
| 4:04:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=14695)|
| 4:05:00| It is 1020.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=14700)|
| 4:05:02| Does anybody need a break?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=14702)|
| 4:05:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=14704)|
| 4:05:05| We're going to go on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=14705)|
| 4:05:06| Councilwoman Palmer, let's get this out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=14706)|
| 4:05:08| If you want a break, we can do it afterwards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=14708)|
| 4:05:10| But Councilwoman Palmer has asked, due to her family situation, that we move up 12 S, T, U, and V.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=14710)|
| 4:05:17| Those are in her district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=14717)|
| 4:05:18| If there's no objection, we will do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=14718)|
| 4:05:20| 12 what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=14720)|
| 4:05:21| 12 S, as in Sam.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=14721)|
| 4:05:23| We'll start with 12 S.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=14723)|
| 4:05:25| Is there any objection to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=14725)|
| 4:05:27| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=14727)|
| 4:05:28| Move it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=14728)|
| 4:05:29| 12 S is an ordinance to rezone property located on the southeast side of Old Callahan Drive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=14729)|
| 4:05:33| northeast of Clinton Highway from PC1 District to C3 District, Arthur Seymour, Jr. Applicant, 3rd District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=14733)|
| 4:05:40| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=14740)|
| 4:05:41| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=14741)|
| 4:05:42| Mayor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=14742)|
| 4:05:44| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=14744)|
| 4:05:45| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=14745)|
| 4:05:46| General Green, I understand the staff wanted no additional access to Old Callahan Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=14746)|
| 4:05:54| That was the recommendation the staff made for safety, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=14754)|
| 4:05:58| Yes, for safety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=14758)|
| 4:05:59| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=14759)|
| 4:06:00| Is that condition still in there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=14760)|
| 4:06:01| No, that was not approved by the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=14761)|
| 4:06:04| I would like to add the condition back to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=14764)|
| 4:06:10| to Callahan Drive, that there are existing accesses they can use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=14770)|
| 4:06:14| That is that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=14774)|
| 4:06:17| Do you understand what he's saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=14777)|
| 4:06:20| I think there was a condition that PCA recommended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=14780)|
| 4:06:25| Do you want a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=14785)|
| 4:06:26| Are you speaking to that, Mr. Seymour?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=14786)|
| 4:06:30| If I may, if Councilman Dellavopa gets a second on that, I'd like to speak to why that was taken down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=14790)|
| 4:06:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=14796)|
| 4:06:37| Would you state again what your motion is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=14797)|
| 4:06:38| The motion is to add to this approval the condition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=14798)|
| 4:06:41| John S., 12S?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=14801)|
| 4:06:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=14803)|
| 4:06:44| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=14804)|
| 4:06:45| On the rezoning, that the staff condition, well, it's where it originated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=14805)|
| 4:06:49| but the condition that there be no additional access to Old Callahan Drive be included as a condition to the approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=14809)|
| 4:06:57| That was the recommendation of the MPC staff for safety reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=14817)|
| 4:07:03| It says on page 738, access to the site must come from existing driveways to the northeast and or southwest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=14823)|
| 4:07:14| And that makes it compatible, they said, with surrounding use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=14834)|
| 4:07:17| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=14837)|
| 4:07:21| There's no second, so that fails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=14841)|
| 4:07:23| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=14843)|
| 4:07:24| We're done with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=14844)|
| 4:07:25| So we're back to the original motion, and there's no need to speak there, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=14845)|
| 4:07:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=14849)|
| 4:07:31| We're voting on the original motion as presented there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=14851)|
| 4:07:33| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=14853)|

| 4:07:54| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=14874)|
| 4:07:55| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=14875)|
| 4:07:56| Councilman Della Vothe, are your lights on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=14876)|
| 4:07:58| I'm sorry, that's from before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=14878)|
| 4:07:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=14879)|
| 4:08:00| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=14880)|

| 4:08:03| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=14883)|
| 4:08:04| The ayes have it, and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=14884)|
| 4:08:05| 12U is an ordinance approving the request of DDC Dowell Springs, LLC, for an amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=14885)|

| 4:14:27| Mr. Green, I think this is one where they wanted a more open zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=15267)|
| 4:14:32| and you all recommended C3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=15272)|
| 4:14:34| Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=15274)|
| 4:14:35| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=15275)|
| 4:14:36| The property was split-zoned, SC1 and C3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=15276)|
| 4:14:39| So you wanted to make it uniform as all C3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=15279)|
| 4:14:42| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=15282)|

| 4:15:29| I think we should give them a hand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=15329)|
| 4:15:30| It's only 1030.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=15330)|
| 4:15:31| We've been here four and a half hours, and you stuck it through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=15331)|

| 4:15:48| And you have earned our respect more than ever by being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=15348)|
| 4:15:53| Well, I'd like to start off by saying thank you to all the city council members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=15353)|
| 4:15:56| for everything that you're doing for the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=15356)|
| 4:16:00| And I really appreciate all those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=15360)|
| 4:16:02| Name and address for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=15362)|
| 4:16:03| My name is Billy Ballew.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=15363)|
| 4:16:05| I'm a resident of Knoxville, 5611 Lon Roberts Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=15365)|
| 4:16:11| I come before you on behalf of all of the veterans of America.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=15371)|
| 4:16:15| In America, we have a major crisis epidemic situation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=15375)|
| 4:16:18| with what's going on with our veterans in America.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=15378)|
| 4:16:22| I call upon the city council of Knoxville to step up and stand forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=15382)|
| 4:16:26| for the veterans that are suffering in crisis on the streets,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=15386)|
| 4:16:30| dying from addiction and low self-worth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=15390)|
| 4:16:33| taking their own lives at 22 members of the American Veterans Association a day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=15393)|
| 4:16:40| That is over 10,000 American veterans that are losing their lives| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=15400)|
| 4:16:45| due to the neglect of the people who they have served faithfully| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=15405)|
| 4:16:50| to provide them their liberties, rights, and freedoms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=15410)|
| 4:16:54| Also, we have 327,000 approximately homeless veterans in America.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=15414)|
| 4:17:00| We have a crisis situation on our hands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=15420)|
| 4:17:03| In Knoxville, the numbers are astronomical.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=15423)|
| 4:17:07| I was one of them numbers approximately 10 years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=15427)|
| 4:17:11| I walked across this bridge in Knoxville, Tennessee at 26 degrees during the winter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=15431)|
| 4:17:19| with no comforting support from anybody in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=15439)|
| 4:17:23| At the same time, I am acquainted with a man| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=15443)|
| 4:17:26| who was running for city council seat here approximately 10 years ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=15446)|
| 4:17:31| who come into a crisis situation due to the neglect of the Veterans Administration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=15451)|
| 4:17:36| He reached out to the city of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=15456)|
| 4:17:39| asking for only one month's support in his rent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=15459)|
| 4:17:43| to prevent him from becoming a homeless veteran in the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=15463)|
| 4:17:47| No one in the city of Knoxville would pick up the ball| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=15467)|
| 4:17:51| for this man running as a politician in our city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=15471)|
| 4:17:55| That is a disgrace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=15475)|
| 4:17:57| The things that need to be changed within our city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=15477)|
| 4:17:59| is something that we need to put on the agenda| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=15479)|
| 4:18:02| and the forefront for our veterans of America.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=15482)|
| 4:18:05| This week, we honor the veterans of America| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=15485)|
| 4:18:07| who have provided us our liberties, rights, and freedoms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=15487)|
| 4:18:10| with their lives, their families' lives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=15490)|
| 4:18:14| We cannot continue to watch our veterans on the streets| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=15494)|
| 4:18:18| suffering from drug addiction, mental health,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=15498)|
| 4:18:21| and not being able to obtain the support needs to save their lives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=15501)|
| 4:18:27| I am a suicide prevention counselor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=15507)|
| 4:18:29| and I have been preventing suicides with American veterans in America| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=15509)|
| 4:18:33| for the last three years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=15513)|
| 4:18:36| I have saved Vietnam veterans. I have saved Afghanistan veterans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=15516)|
| 4:18:40| I have saved veterans from the Cold War.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=15520)|
| 4:18:43| All I ask you to do is step up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=15523)|
| 4:18:46| and provide a little bit of assistance for a home for the brave,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=15526)|
| 4:18:51| a home for our heroes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=15531)|
| 4:18:54| We are working on implementing new fund-gathering events| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=15534)|
| 4:19:03| to gather funds to provide dignity homes in the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=15543)|
| 4:19:09| And at the cost of $10,000 apiece,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=15549)|
| 4:19:12| we are out gathering these funds through nonprofit donation contributions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=15552)|
| 4:19:17| and taking the time out of our life to do what is necessary to save our veterans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=15557)|
| 4:19:23| And if we can't take care of our veterans, who can we take care of?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=15563)|
| 4:19:27| Over 10,000 veterans a year are committing suicide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=15567)|
| 4:19:31| If each and every American would stand up and step forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=15571)|
| 4:19:34| as the red, white, and blue serving our veterans,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=15574)|
| 4:19:37| we would not have this crisis in America.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=15577)|
| 4:19:40| It is appalling when the federal government does not approve medical claims| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=15580)|
| 4:19:45| for veterans in crisis to receive medical care| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=15585)|
| 4:19:49| and pushes them away from the hospitals and they die| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=15589)|
| 4:19:52| in the parking lots of our Veterans Administration Hospital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=15592)|
| 4:19:55| In the year 2015, 327,000 veterans in America died| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=15595)|
| 4:20:00| due to the neglect of the Veterans Administration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=15600)|
| 4:20:03| And those processes are still continuing today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=15603)|
| 4:20:07| One minute, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=15607)|
| 4:20:09| I ask each and every city council member on this board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=15609)|
| 4:20:14| to do what is right for our veterans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=15614)|
| 4:20:17| and play your part because it is in every city district in Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=15617)|
| 4:20:24| I want to thank you very much for representing the city of Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=15624)|
| 4:20:28| and that's all I have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=15628)|
| 4:20:30| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=15630)|
| 4:20:31| God bless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=15631)|
| 4:20:32| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=15632)|
| 4:20:35| Mr. Willie Franklin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=15635)|
| 4:20:39| Please state your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=15639)|
| 4:20:41| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=15641)|
| 4:20:42| My name is Anthony Hall, but I'm better known as Willie Franklin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=15642)|
| 4:20:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=15645)|
| 4:20:46| I was a singer-songwriter for years and years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=15646)|
| 4:20:48| and I still tour and play when I can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=15648)|
| 4:20:51| I came into Knoxville 10 years ago, stepped off a bus homeless,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=15651)|
| 4:20:55| stepped on a gay street, didn't know where I was going to go,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=15655)|
| 4:20:58| what I was going to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=15658)|
| 4:21:00| And this city saved my life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=15660)|
| 4:21:03| I got some hope here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=15663)|
| 4:21:05| A few people reached out to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=15665)|
| 4:21:07| I was able to take a break, take a pause,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=15667)|
| 4:21:11| and find my life, find the Lord, find love again, and begin to love again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=15671)|
| 4:21:18| Now I'm chief executive director, broom pusher,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=15678)|
| 4:21:24| and everything else of an organization called Home for Heroes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=15684)|
| 4:21:27| We build tiny houses for disabled veterans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=15687)|
| 4:21:30| Now I'm seeing you all looking at me like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=15690)|
| 4:21:32| yeah, I've seen you on Channel 8, Channel 6.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=15692)|
| 4:21:34| We have built some houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=15694)|
| 4:21:36| We haven't scratched the surface on what we want to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=15696)|
| 4:21:39| We would love to come to Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=15699)|
| 4:21:41| and be able to set up a tiny home community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=15701)|
| 4:21:45| as an example to the rest of the world| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=15705)|
| 4:21:48| on what can be done to help our veterans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=15708)|
| 4:21:53| Billy and I don't even know each other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=15713)|
| 4:21:55| We met accidentally through reacting to each other's comments on Facebook.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=15715)|
| 4:22:01| Billy's a big proponent. He's a veteran.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=15721)|
| 4:22:03| He's a proponent for our veterans who are suffering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=15723)|
| 4:22:08| I come to the streets under the bridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=15728)|
| 4:22:10| I do coat drives. I meet veterans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=15730)|
| 4:22:12| I shake their hands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=15732)|
| 4:22:13| Not only veterans, but the homeless also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=15733)|
| 4:22:15| You can't turn somebody away when they're cold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=15735)|
| 4:22:18| But our veterans are the ones who served us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=15738)|
| 4:22:23| The reason we can come and debate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=15743)|
| 4:22:25| the reason we can come have uniform meetings like this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=15745)|
| 4:22:28| is because somebody paid for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=15748)|

| 4:22:43| I would not have your job for one minute,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=15763)|
| 4:22:46| and you guys earned your money tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=15766)|
| 4:22:50| I would love to reach out to you guys if you allow me to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=15770)|
| 4:22:53| and tell you my plan and my dream| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=15773)|
| 4:22:55| and what we can do to save some of these guys| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=15775)|
| 4:22:58| who are walking past us and end up with needles in their arms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=15778)|
| 4:23:03| Young kids today who went into the service| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=15783)|
| 4:23:05| usually went into the service because of a bad home life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=15785)|
| 4:23:09| They had no alternative when they got out of high school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=15789)|
| 4:23:11| They went into the service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=15791)|
| 4:23:13| So now when they're reentering, they don't have a safety net.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=15793)|
| 4:23:18| There's no program there for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=15798)|
| 4:23:20| We want to be that program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=15800)|
| 4:23:21| We want to give them a place where they can come,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=15801)|
| 4:23:23| have a community center where they can go online| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=15803)|
| 4:23:26| and go back to school and be able to go on events,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=15806)|
| 4:23:29| be able just to take a breath from the war.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=15809)|
| 4:23:32| One day they're in Afghanistan, the next day they're here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=15812)|
| 4:23:35| That's just wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=15815)|
| 4:23:37| We need to help them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=15817)|
| 4:23:39| I appreciate you taking the time to listen to me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=15819)|
| 4:23:42| and good luck with all this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=15822)|
| 4:23:47| To both of you, just a second, counsel, very quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=15827)|
| 4:23:51| To both of you, I want you to know that we very much appreciate that you came.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=15831)|
| 4:23:55| You raised issues that we are very concerned about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=15835)|
| 4:23:57| and that we are working to address them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=15837)|
| 4:24:00| and we would love to have your assistance with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=15840)|
| 4:24:02| We have the Mayor's Roundtable on Homelessness,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=15842)|
| 4:24:05| where we meet quarterly with probably 30 different agencies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=15845)|
| 4:24:10| that serve those who are homeless, including veterans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=15850)|
| 4:24:13| Councilman Finbar Saunders has served on that as well, representing City Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=15853)|
| 4:24:17| In our Office of Homelessness, we have our director of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=15857)|
| 4:24:21| our manager of that is Mike Dunthorne.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=15861)|
| 4:24:24| If you would please give your contact information to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=15864)|
| 4:24:27| who wants to get it to David Brace will take it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=15867)|
| 4:24:32| and I would like to put you in touch with Mike Dunthorne| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=15872)|
| 4:24:36| so that you are aware of what we're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=15876)|
| 4:24:39| I actually just heard today of a potential permanent supportive housing project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=15879)|
| 4:24:42| with one of our local agencies that would particularly serve veterans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=15882)|
| 4:24:46| We have funded similar projects in the past that provide housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=15886)|
| 4:24:51| and support the agencies that support those who are veterans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=15891)|
| 4:24:56| So we want to work with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=15896)|
| 4:24:59| Isn't the Home Group building some homes for veterans?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=15899)|
| 4:25:02| There are several different initiatives going on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=15902)|
| 4:25:05| but as you mentioned, the need is greater than the resources here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=15905)|
| 4:25:10| So we want to work with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=15910)|
| 4:25:12| We appreciate it so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=15912)|
| 4:25:14| I know it's in your heart for you to be here four and a half hours later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=15914)|
| 4:25:18| Thank you, and we'll contact you if you've given him your contact information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=15918)|
| 4:25:24| All right, thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=15924)|
| 4:25:26| Mayor, if I could just ask him, if I could just ask you, sir,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=15926)|
| 4:25:29| are you working with Clayton Homes or anyone to build these tiny homes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=15929)|
| 4:25:32| Do you have a corporate entity that's maybe doing it for you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=15932)|
| 4:25:36| We use volunteers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=15936)|
| 4:25:38| You build them by hand?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=15938)|
| 4:25:39| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=15939)|
| 4:25:40| We hand nail everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=15940)|
| 4:25:41| We beg for lumber and materials, and we get enough, we build one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=15941)|
| 4:25:44| But we have plenty of volunteer help to swing hammers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=15944)|
| 4:25:49| Do you have the money to get the materials?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=15949)|
| 4:25:51| We need materials and we need property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=15951)|
| 4:25:53| And, you know, just the little things that come along with that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=15953)|
| 4:25:57| workstations, computers, you know, all that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=15957)|
| 4:26:00| But the main thing is getting them in a house immediately, you know, as soon as we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=15960)|
| 4:26:06| And we vet them first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=15966)|
| 4:26:08| You know, we find out if they have a drug addiction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=15968)|
| 4:26:10| We help them get to that place where they can come out of that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=15970)|
| 4:26:13| and transition back into our home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=15973)|
| 4:26:16| It's a long process and a hard process, but it can be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=15976)|
| 4:26:20| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=15980)|
| 4:26:21| Thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=15981)|
| 4:26:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=15982)|
| 4:26:24| We are adjourned at 1041.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=15984)|
