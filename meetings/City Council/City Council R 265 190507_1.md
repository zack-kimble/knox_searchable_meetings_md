| 2:37:24| and my concerns were really based on maybe one of the questions that Councilwoman Ryder had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=9444)|
| 2:37:29| and some concerns I heard from businesses in the Cumberland Avenue District around parking. And so,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=9449)|
| 2:37:37| I just want to thank particularly Bill Lyons for working with the University of Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=9457)|
| 2:37:42| and coming to an agreement around parking availability and developing a formal arrangement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=9462)|
| 2:37:50| around that and ensuring that even though the intention always was for this to continue to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=9470)|
| 2:37:57| be a public access road, that that is now in writing and that's part of the agreement. So,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=9477)|
| 2:38:04| I just want to thank you for doing that and thank the University of Tennessee also for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=9484)|
| 2:38:08| negotiating so well on that. Right. And we're very appreciative of your pushing us a little| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=9488)|
| 2:38:14| on that. That's always very helpful. Thank you. And we have Jeff from the University of Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=9494)|
| 2:38:19| is here and we really very much want to express our appreciation for all that UT has done with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=9499)|
| 2:38:27| these roads that we have transferred. If you haven't noticed, they remain open and not only| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=9507)|
| 2:38:32| remain open, but the landscaping, the sidewalks, the walkability is at levels that the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=9512)|
| 2:38:37| taxpayers could never afford to support and they're beautiful and the campus is beautiful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=9517)|
| 2:38:42| And also, and not but last but not least, we've got what are well near a thousand spaces that the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=9522)|
| 2:38:49| university is making available on nights and weekends just a block away from Cumberland Avenue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=9529)|
| 2:38:56| to support the Cumberland Avenue businesses. And one of the things that Councilwoman Welch asked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=9536)|
| 2:39:00| was that we see if we could get that commitment for that over a number of years and UT was very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=9540)|
| 2:39:07| cooperative in doing that as well. That is in the parking garage. That's in the parking garage. So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=9547)|
| 2:39:13| all together the relationship with, and I know Council, you know earlier in the evening we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=9553)|
| 2:39:17| discussed the participation of UT on the infrastructure, the city infrastructure. So we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=9557)|
| 2:39:23| think the town-gown relationship is extremely healthy and we really appreciate the university's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=9563)|
| 2:39:29| cooperation on that and we also appreciate your making sure we codified some things that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=9569)|
| 2:39:33| probably need to codify. So thank you. Thanks. Very good. So we have a motion and a second. All| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=9573)|

| 2:44:46| Okay Council, we are now at public forum. There are two folks who have signed up. The first is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=9886)|
| 2:44:52| David Hayes and then Greg Duthie. Is that the right name? Okay. Mr. Hayes, please come and state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=9892)|
| 2:44:58| your name and address for the record and thank you for being here and you have up to five minutes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=9898)|
| 2:45:03| if you keep an eye on the timer once it gets up there. There we go. My name is David Hayes. I live| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=9903)|
| 2:45:10| in 1213 Hawthorne Avenue. So why is myself and so many people in Knoxville critical of public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=9910)|
| 2:45:19| budgets and also the budget proposed today and this year? There's a few reasons for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=9919)|
| 2:45:27| One of which is incorrect assumptions that resources are too scarce to meet people's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=9927)|
| 2:45:33| needs. We live in a city of millionaires and billionaires and million dollar companies and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=9933)|
| 2:45:37| giving away millions of dollars in tax breaks yet communities are constantly told| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=9937)|
| 2:45:42| that resources are too scarce for us. We see eliminated and underfunded social services,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=9942)|
| 2:45:49| public services and programs. We are seeing resources shared inequitably. Working class| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=9949)|
| 2:45:55| communities, black and brown communities receiving little investment, disinvestment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=9955)|
| 2:45:59| underdevelopment, gentrification and displacement. So this limiting of social services and putting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=9959)|
| 2:46:07| money over people is hurting people who have the least the most. Our regressive taxes like our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=9967)|
| 2:46:12| sales tax for instance is not working for the people and we're seeing rich people pay less of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=9972)|
| 2:46:17| the money in taxes and low income people pay a lot more resulting in less money for our social| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=9977)|
| 2:46:23| services. We are seeing crisis and inequity, a crisis in poverty and inequality. We are ranked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=9983)|
| 2:46:31| third in the nation in growing inequality and a crisis in unmet needs. These can be looked at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=9991)|
| 2:46:39| as some of the root causes for the housing crisis and our street violence. So it's clear that the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=9999)|
| 2:46:44| market and private sector in our current government budgets are failing to meet people's needs and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=10004)|
| 2:46:48| we're continuing to be in positions where we're defending the crumbs and little resources we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=10008)|
| 2:46:53| competing amongst one another, different groups trying to get in the budget. We are seeing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=10013)|
| 2:46:58| divisions among our people and communities and organizations and we're seeing valid disillusionment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=10018)|
| 2:47:03| and distrust of the local political process and government involvement. So if we had a city that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=10023)|
| 2:47:09| worked for everybody, that centered human rights and democracy, if we had a Knoxville that worked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=10029)|
| 2:47:16| for all, we could reclaim our government and people could say that government should be making| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=10036)|
| 2:47:21| sure people's needs are met, realizing our rights like democracy, saying that people have a right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=10041)|
| 2:47:28| to what goes on in our city government, our budget, our operations and development in their communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=10048)|
| 2:47:33| And communities would have a say in what public safety is. Instead of being told what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=10053)|
| 2:47:38| public safety is, we could actually say like these are the things that keep us safe and those could| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=10058)|
| 2:47:42| be invested in. So I believe that would look like a people's budget, a people's budget that centers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=10062)|
| 2:47:48| human rights and democracy, that centers universality, the concept that everybody deserves to have their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=10068)|
| 2:47:55| needs met and equity, you know, saying that people got to give, some people give what they need and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=10075)|
| 2:48:00| people can give what they can so people can get what they need and not everybody gets the same,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=10080)|
| 2:48:05| some people need more. So we need a budget, a people's budget that is crafted directly to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=10085)|
| 2:48:11| address fundamental human needs and budgeting decisions to be explicitly connected to accountability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=10091)|
| 2:48:17| measures and progress measures in accordance to human rights and people's lives. And we need people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=10097)|
| 2:48:24| to be able to participate in the entire budget process, especially in developing the goals and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=10104)|
| 2:48:30| priorities for spending and raising money. And most of all, we need the budget process to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=10110)|
| 2:48:35| fully transparent from start to end. Participatory budgeting would help in this goal. It would help| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=10115)|
| 2:48:42| us prioritize projects and departments that would benefit the most disadvantaged communities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=10122)|
| 2:48:48| and address the deepest and most urgent needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=10128)|
| 2:48:52| And when it comes to tax policies, we need to have a tax policy that actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=10132)|
| 2:48:57| followed a need-based spending policy, saying, let's identify the needs and identify the spending| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=10137)|
| 2:49:02| that we need to meet those needs, right, and seek to fund this needs-based budget in an equitable way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=10142)|
| 2:49:09| So that is to say that working class people should not be paying high sales taxes on groceries| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=10149)|

| 2:49:18| low taxes and low wages. So it's important that we are critical of the budget process. It's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=10158)|
| 2:49:24| important that I'm here tonight sitting through the whole long night. It's important that even| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=10164)|
| 2:49:30| though there's not that many of us in the room tonight, this time, it's important for me to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=10170)|
| 2:49:35| here to, you know, communicate what a lot of people are feeling in the community as far as not being| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=10175)|
| 2:49:40| involved in a budget, not being involved in the city government, and not seeing our government| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=10180)|
| 2:49:44| reflect human rights and democracy and not feeling our government works for all people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=10184)|
| 2:49:48| and it's trying to work for all people. So we need a people's budget that centers human rights| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=10188)|
| 2:49:53| and democracy and this is not a people's budget and this is not making a Knoxville for all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=10193)|
| 2:49:59| Thank you, sir. Our next speaker is Greg Duthie. Thank you, sir, for being here. Please state your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=10199)|

| 2:50:14| Mayor, I wanted to first apologize to you. You weren't here at the last meeting two weeks ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=10214)|
| 2:50:19| I mispronounced your name. I probably said the most common mispronunciation for your name, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=10219)|
| 2:50:25| I stand corrected. So let me start again and say, Madam Rojero, Mayor Rojero, council members,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=10225)|
| 2:50:34| city officials, I want to thank you for your service to the city. It's unfortunate that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=10234)|
| 2:50:43| often hear criticism at these meetings, yet I hope that I and others can express our concerns at future| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=10243)|
| 2:50:51| meetings in a way that can be heard. Two weeks ago, as you might recall, two of us spoke to you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=10251)|
| 2:51:01| about the concerns that we had with the condition of some historic Knoxville cemeteries in the Westview| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=10261)|
| 2:51:09| community. Now just to clarify, our group, Save Knox Historic Cemeteries, actually is interested| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=10269)|
| 2:51:16| in the maintenance and preservation of all Knoxville and Knox County historic cemeteries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=10276)|
| 2:51:25| Since the last council meeting, our group has received encouragement and support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=10285)|
| 2:51:29| for our endeavors from numerous individuals and groups. Recently, we met with Holly Cox| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=10289)|
| 2:51:36| at Knox Heritage and Ellen Adcock from the Westview Community Action Group, and I wish to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=10296)|
| 2:51:43| thank them for being proactive in helping improve the condition of Knoxville's Westview cemeteries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=10303)|
| 2:51:51| On a side note, Ellen Adcock and I have also been working to re-energize the Westview Community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=10311)|
| 2:51:57| Action Group in general, and are inviting Westview neighborhood residents and businesses to be part| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=10317)|
| 2:52:05| of helping us make an overall improvement in that neighborhood. We will be providing information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=10325)|
| 2:52:13| about our next neighborhood meeting in the upcoming weeks. I would also like to take time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=10333)|
| 2:52:19| now to acknowledge several others who've been working very hard and helping us with both the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=10339)|
| 2:52:24| cemeteries and crime in the Westview neighborhood. Recently, our group and some residents noticed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=10344)|
| 2:52:31| some illegal activities, and we were privileged to speak with and get help from Knoxville Police| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=10351)|
| 2:52:37| Department Officer Bradley. We were also able to interact with Knox County Sheriff Deputy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=10357)|
| 2:52:46| Joseph Cooper and his workers, and want to thank them for their work at Crestview Cemetery.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=10366)|
| 2:52:53| The Westview neighborhood is appreciative of this maintenance help at Crestview from Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=10373)|
| 2:53:00| and the supervision of this ongoing effort by former city council member Ivan Harmon at the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=10380)|
| 2:53:06| Knox County Detention Center. As council will recall, at the last meeting I challenged all of you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=10386)|
| 2:53:14| to visit the Westview Historic Cemetery District near Keith Avenue in District 3, served by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=10394)|
| 2:53:20| Councilwoman Singh Perez. Although each of you city council members surely have enough on your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=10400)|
| 2:53:28| plate in the district that you serve, it can be very helpful when council members outside your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=10408)|
| 2:53:35| district understand your issues. Along that line, I would like to thank Councilwoman McKenzie for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=10415)|
| 2:53:43| being supportive and willing to work with us, and especially with another councilwoman, Singh Perez,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=10423)|
| 2:53:52| in improving the condition of the cemeteries in the Westview area. Lastly, I want to share a story| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=10432)|
| 2:53:59| with you about a friend of mine who lost his first wife at the young age of 21 in 1974.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=10439)|
| 2:54:06| While I was eating at Hardee's one morning on Clinton Highway a couple weeks ago, I was sharing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=10446)|
| 2:54:11| about our efforts to clean up Longview, Southern Chain, and Crestview cemeteries. The man said his| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=10451)|
| 2:54:18| wife was at Longview, but he didn't know where exactly she was, and it had been many years since| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=10458)|
| 2:54:24| he visited the grave. He and I rode out to the cemetery, and later that day, I went back and did| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=10464)|
| 2:54:29| a looping back and forth walk through the brush, thorns, and vines. Eventually, I found the grave| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=10469)|
| 2:54:36| after about an hour, and worked for two hours cutting through the brush, thorns, and vines,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=10476)|
| 2:54:43| and the jungle-like conditions to make these numerous family graves accessible for my elderly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=10483)|
| 2:54:50| friend. I can't tell you what a blessing it was to see the appreciation on his face,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=10490)|
| 2:54:56| and to help a man pay his respects to the mother of his children. In closing, the Westview Community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=10496)|
| 2:55:04| Action Group is committed to improving conditions of the historic cemeteries and the neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=10504)|
| 2:55:09| in general. We are hoping that you, Madam Rojero, the City of Knoxville, and the Westview neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=10509)|
| 2:55:17| will help us in moving forward. We have an email that we provided two weeks ago. It's all lowercase| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190507?start=10517)|
