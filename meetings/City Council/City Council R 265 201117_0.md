| 0:05:07| I want to begin by talking about the alarming number of COVID-19 cases in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=307)|
| 0:05:14| The last three days, the Knox County Health Department has reported record-breaking days when it comes to the number of new cases in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=314)|
| 0:05:23| Today was a new record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=323)|
| 0:05:26| Yesterday was a record the day before, and we're about 100 cases more today than we were Sunday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=326)|
| 0:05:31| So we're breaking records not by one or two at a time, but the accelerating rate is not just arithmetic or geometric, but it's really becoming exponential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=331)|
| 0:05:43| Sadly, we also had the highest number of deaths ever reported in a single day was today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=343)|
| 0:05:48| Seven Knox County residents died today from COVID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=348)|
| 0:05:53| And, of course, all this is coming at a time when we traditionally gather together in enclosed spaces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=353)|
| 0:05:58| It's my favorite holiday, Thanksgiving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=358)|
| 0:06:01| So I know city council members take this very seriously and have all along, so I want to encourage you and your constituents and the people of the city and community to please alter and adjust your Thanksgiving plans and other gathering plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=361)|
| 0:06:17| If you're gathering with people outside your household, first consider just postponing those gatherings until after the pandemic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=377)|
| 0:06:25| If you cannot, have your group be as small as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=385)|
| 0:06:30| Be physically distanced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=390)|
| 0:06:32| We are lucky to live in East Tennessee where our weather is relatively mild.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=392)|
| 0:06:36| So eat outside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=396)|
| 0:06:38| Open the windows if you have to be inside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=398)|
| 0:06:41| Try to have your Thanksgiving dinner earlier in the day so the sun is still up and bright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=401)|
| 0:06:47| Obviously, follow the five core actions continuously at work, at home, at social gatherings, formal and informal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=407)|
| 0:06:55| And that means, you know, you know what that means.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=415)|
| 0:06:58| Wash your hands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=418)|
| 0:07:00| Offer hand sanitizing stations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=420)|
| 0:07:02| Wear your masks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=422)|
| 0:07:04| Wear masks inside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=424)|
| 0:07:06| It really does help you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=426)|
| 0:07:08| It helps the wearer and it helps people around you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=428)|
| 0:07:10| We can all lead by example by celebrating responsibly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=430)|
| 0:07:13| And please encourage everyone in our spheres of influence to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=433)|
| 0:07:18| We are encouraging people, I'm encouraging people throughout the city to do that and including especially our city employees because their health and welfare is essential to the functioning of our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=438)|
| 0:07:32| On a related note, a reminder tonight that the deadline to apply for COVID utility assistance through CAC is rapidly approaching.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=452)|
| 0:07:41| If your household has lost any income due to COVID-19, money is available from the Knoxville-Knox County Community Action Committee to pay unpaid utility bills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=461)|

| 0:08:03| So I also want to take the time as we enter this season of giving to thank all of the city employees who are giving so generously to area nonprofits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=483)|
| 0:08:12| 2020 has been a difficult year for everyone, and many nonprofits have taken a huge hit to their fundraising efforts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=492)|
| 0:08:18| Thankfully, there are countless ways to help out in our community, and I know many of us are thinking about ways to give back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=498)|
| 0:08:24| So I want to publicly recognize the city's Consolidated Charities Committee for putting together this year's Giving Campaign| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=504)|
| 0:08:31| and to say thank you to all the employees for making pledges of support through the Consolidated Charities Campaign,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=511)|
| 0:08:37| as well as other efforts such as the Secret Santa programs and Parks and Rec.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=517)|
| 0:08:41| These programs and so many others exemplify the giving spirit of this community and make me proud to be Knoxville's mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=521)|
| 0:08:48| With that said, in case I forget, at the end of the meeting, this is our last meeting before the Thanksgiving holiday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=528)|

| 0:09:05| And that's going to do it for my mayor's report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=545)|
| 0:09:08| Are there any reports from council members?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=548)|

| 0:12:49| Any discussion, questions, Council Member Ryder?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=769)|
| 0:12:52| I just wanted to, for the record, I wanted to thank Mr. Lansden for continuing conversations with the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=772)|
| 0:13:00| I am going to remain a no on this zoning because I do feel strongly that the CG-2 with the form-based standards is a better fit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=780)|
| 0:13:11| And I understand that that was not considered at the Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=791)|
| 0:13:15| It wasn't something he was familiar with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=795)|
| 0:13:17| But I just, for the record, want to say that I look forward to his continuing conversations with Vice Mayor McKenzie and the neighbors over there about the residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=797)|
| 0:13:25| And I look forward to seeing that and the financing that comes into play for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=805)|
| 0:13:31| And I have had conversations with Ms. Brooks about CG-1 and the standards not applying to that one zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=811)|
| 0:13:40| We did have a meeting about that and discussed it last Friday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=820)|
| 0:13:43| And just my feelings are based upon the sector plan stating that form-based code is something that should be applied in this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=823)|
| 0:13:52| Thank you, Council Member Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=832)|
| 0:13:56| Any further questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=836)|
| 0:13:57| Council Member Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=837)|
| 0:13:58| I just wanted to add to that since I'm also a no vote and I plan to stick to my no vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=838)|
| 0:14:05| But I didn't have an opportunity to say this at the last meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=845)|
| 0:14:09| And so I wanted to take the time to say that I really appreciate the proposed plans that have been presented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=849)|
| 0:14:19| I'm excited about the price point that they're at and for the housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=859)|
| 0:14:27| And look forward to supporting the project, hopefully, when it comes to us through the Affordable Housing Fund request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=867)|
| 0:14:35| But have my own concerns about the zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=875)|
| 0:14:40| And so I'm not able to support the zoning change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=880)|
| 0:14:42| Thank you, Council Member Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=882)|
| 0:14:46| Council Member Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=886)|
| 0:14:47| I will remain a yes vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=887)|
| 0:14:49| But the issues that Council Person Ryder brought, I think, are reasonable grounds for further discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=889)|
| 0:15:00| And I would encourage those discussions to continue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=900)|

| 0:15:09| Council Member Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=909)|
| 0:15:10| I just want to add to Mr. Lansing's praise in the sense that this is a hard project to pull off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=910)|
| 0:15:17| And not a lot of developers would take it on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=917)|
| 0:15:19| And I applaud his development concept.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=919)|
| 0:15:22| I think it's great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=922)|
| 0:15:23| And I honor him for trying to pull this off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=923)|
| 0:15:27| It's much needed in that community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=927)|
| 0:15:29| I have similar concerns about the zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=929)|
| 0:15:31| But he and I discussed this at length, and I'll be cheering for him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=931)|

| 0:17:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=1029)|
| 0:17:10| Motion made by Council Member Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=1030)|
| 0:17:11| Seconded by Council Member Fugger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=1031)|
| 0:17:12| First person signed up to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=1032)|
| 0:17:13| Benjamin Mullins speaking in favor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=1033)|
| 0:17:14| Mr. Mullins, are you on the call?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=1034)|
| 0:17:15| I am Ben Mullins, 550 West Main Street, Suite 500.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=1035)|
| 0:17:26| I sent an email out following up on some of the matters that we discussed the last time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=1046)|
| 0:17:34| for consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=1054)|
| 0:17:35| Since then, I've had conversations with Mr. Frost about the proposed deed restrictions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=1055)|
| 0:17:42| And I've already taken those comments and made some revisions and have that to him for his review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=1062)|
| 0:17:50| so we can make sure that they are enforceable by the apartments, which is one of the questions he had, whether or not what I proposed would be enforceable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=1070)|
| 0:18:01| So, I have taken those comments and got a draft to him for review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=1081)|
| 0:18:06| We'll continue to work with them on finalizing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=1086)|
| 0:18:10| We can't file them until we close on the property, and we can't close on the property until the zoning is in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=1090)|
| 0:18:15| But we are going to follow through with that promise that we've made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=1095)|
| 0:18:22| Other than that, I'm here and I believe Mr. Nelson is here to answer any questions that may come up with regard to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=1102)|
| 0:18:30| I know there's still probably some questions and some conversation to be had, and we look forward to having that and hopefully having this approved tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=1110)|
| 0:18:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=1118)|

| 0:18:45| Mr. Nelson, please start by stating your name and address for the record, and you'll have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=1125)|
| 0:18:51| Good evening, everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=1131)|

| 0:18:55| Address is 6410 Poplar Avenue, Suite 385, Memphis, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=1135)|
| 0:18:59| Nothing really new since last we talked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=1139)|
| 0:19:03| We've been working hard to get this thing done, and we're making good progress on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=1143)|
| 0:19:07| We appreciate all the support from the city administration and council as we've tried to work through this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=1147)|
| 0:19:14| Our customer is getting more and more on board and headed towards a successful project, so we're excited about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=1154)|
| 0:19:22| We're here to answer any questions that you might have, but we appreciate your consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=1162)|
| 0:19:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=1166)|
| 0:19:28| Thank you, Mr. Nelson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=1168)|
| 0:19:30| That concludes the speakers who signed up to speak today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=1170)|
| 0:19:35| Mayor, Mr. Kent Minolt signed up to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=1175)|
| 0:19:38| He signed up to speak on 9F, but he may wish to speak in the first series of these ordinances, but we can call him and ask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=1178)|
| 0:19:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=1189)|
| 0:19:50| Mr. Minolt, are you on the call, and did you want to speak in particular to F as in Frank, or did you want to speak D since that's the first one in the series?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=1190)|
| 0:20:04| Hi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=1204)|
| 0:20:06| Can you all hear me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=1206)|
| 0:20:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=1208)|
| 0:20:09| Great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=1209)|
| 0:20:10| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=1210)|
| 0:20:11| My comment is really about the process leading up to this, so I'm happy to address you now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=1211)|
| 0:20:17| That's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=1217)|
| 0:20:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=1218)|
| 0:20:19| Well, if you could start by stating your name and address for the record, and then you'll have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=1219)|
| 0:20:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=1224)|
| 0:20:25| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=1225)|
| 0:20:26| Sure thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=1226)|
| 0:20:27| And I live at 311 West Glenwood Avenue in Knoxville, 37917.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=1227)|
| 0:20:34| And I just want to talk tonight about the process involved in evaluating the proposed change in zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=1234)|
| 0:20:41| I'm most concerned about the lack of attention departments of city government paid to the potential climate impacts of the warehouse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=1241)|
| 0:20:50| Now, the original plan showed 90-plus tractor-trailer bays, and through several meetings of the Planning Commission that dealt with traffic noise and light issues, nobody brought up the impact of that many diesel tractor-trailers coming in and out of our city on a schedule developers said was 24-7 on the level of greenhouse gases released by our city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=1250)|
| 0:21:13| And when asked, a member of the Planning Commission stated she'd never heard of the city's carbon reduction goals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=1273)|
| 0:21:20| So I have a question for the council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=1280)|
| 0:21:23| Has the mayor's office or the Office of Sustainability scheduled meetings with various city departments to discuss how they might evaluate their budget plans and their different projects in light of our carbon reduction goals?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=1283)|
| 0:21:37| Now, what discussions have council members had about how to break down the ambitious goal of reducing our community-wide emissions by 80% by 2050 on a year-by-year basis?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=1297)|
| 0:21:50| Well, for example, what reduction must we have completed by the end of this year in order to be on track?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=1310)|
| 0:21:56| Are there other city departments that have never heard of our carbon reduction goals?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=1316)|
| 0:22:01| Might the city council take action to guarantee that all aspects of city government are aware of the goals, have had staff meetings to fully acquaint everyone with their meaning, and are prepared to factor the goals into their plans and projects?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=1321)|
| 0:22:18| I ask this because of a number of conversations Sierra Club members have had with council members and others in city government, indicating that in our eagerness to find a solution to a potentially blighted property, the city had a temporary lapse of memory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=1338)|
| 0:22:34| This was highlighted when our development director, Aaron Gill, told the council that the emissions impact of the warehouse would be similar to the impact of the old mall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=1354)|
| 0:22:44| Councilwoman Parker pointed out that that meant we weren't progressing toward an ambitious goal, but we're just treading water.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=1364)|
| 0:22:51| It's a little discouraging when there's only one council member keeping her eyes on the prize there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=1371)|
| 0:22:56| And I'm basically concluded, but I want to thank development director Aaron Gill for sending me an update on sustainability information on the project just within the past half hour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=1376)|
| 0:23:10| Thanks so much for that. And that includes my comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=1390)|
| 0:23:14| Thank you, Mr. Minow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=1394)|
| 0:23:16| Council members, that is a, that's the last person signed up to speak to 9D, E, or F.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=1396)|
| 0:23:25| So now we have a motion on the floor to in favor and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=1405)|
| 0:23:31| And I'm happy to hear other comments and questions. Ms. Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=1411)|
| 0:23:36| I just wanted to make a comment for Mr. Nelson and Mr. Mullins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=1416)|
| 0:23:42| I appreciate your continued working with the East Town Apartments to make sure that they're a party to the deed restrictions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=1422)|
| 0:23:49| And I continue and in my conversations with them, he's expressed to me his appreciation and continued conversations with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=1429)|
| 0:23:58| So I appreciate the efforts that you're doing to look forward to that part of the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=1438)|
| 0:24:04| I do have a quick question for Mr. Nelson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=1444)|
| 0:24:08| One of the things that's come to us is questions about vehicles and transportation for this particular facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=1448)|
| 0:24:19| Does the company that is looking to develop on this parcel or to be your tenant here, do they use electric or alternative vehicles?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=1459)|
| 0:24:30| Mr. Nelson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=1470)|
| 0:24:33| Yes. So I don't know the answer to whether they use them as of now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=1473)|
| 0:24:37| I do know that they have a long term plan to improve the sustainability related to their operations and that they're exploring the use of electric vehicles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=1477)|
| 0:24:49| I can't speak to their specific goals, but I know that it's on their list of goals and that addressing climate change is a part of their culture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=1489)|
| 0:25:00| So I can say that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=1500)|
| 0:25:02| Okay. Are any of the LEED or ENERGY STAR standards used in development of your properties, your building?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=1502)|
| 0:25:11| They are occasionally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=1511)|
| 0:25:16| I've seen a lot of what we do go from what used to be more getting certified to now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=1516)|
| 0:25:23| And it was part of that certification process was a good education process for a lot of people in the business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=1523)|
| 0:25:29| And to now where it's more smart design, but not as much focused on making sure I get a plaque to put outside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=1529)|
| 0:25:38| So I think that's the way we and our customer would answer that question is that we're addressing smart design from an energy standpoint and sustainability standpoint, but not so much looking for certification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=1538)|
| 0:25:51| Okay, I've done it both ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=1551)|
| 0:25:53| So I understand I've done LEED ENERGY STAR certified with a plaque on my wall, and I've done it and don't have the plaque on the wall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=1553)|
| 0:26:00| So I understand the built in costs to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=1560)|
| 0:26:04| So I appreciate that you guys are going to look in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=1564)|
| 0:26:06| And I would like to have continued conversations with you guys about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=1566)|
| 0:26:10| And for the record, I just wanted to point out again that these are jobs that are on a transit line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=1570)|
| 0:26:17| So this is and that was one of the things we lost with the mall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=1577)|
| 0:26:21| We had a shopping area and a shopping and a working area and jobs that were on a transit line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=1581)|
| 0:26:29| And so we are now this is jobs on a transit line that gets people who don't have access to a car at the moment, a job, a job opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=1589)|
| 0:26:39| So that's one of the things that we're working with, with you guys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=1599)|
| 0:26:42| And I appreciate the conversations you're having on those transportation issues with the city and with CAT and with the chamber.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=1602)|
| 0:26:49| Certainly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=1609)|
| 0:26:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=1612)|
| 0:26:53| Thank you, Council Member Rodgers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=1613)|
| 0:26:55| Council Member Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=1615)|
| 0:26:56| Yes, I can't emphasize enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=1616)|
| 0:26:58| I think the transportation aspect and I appreciate the initiative that the applicant has expressed in trying to integrate the workforce into some kind of overall system of transportation in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=1618)|
| 0:27:12| That directly relates, of course, not only to employment, but to sustainability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=1632)|
| 0:27:18| In regard to Mr. Minolt's comments, I would encourage the applicant and the Knoxville Office of Sustainability with Ms. Gill,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=1638)|
| 0:27:28| who's always been open with me with dialogue to continue a dialogue, a serious dialogue as this project goes forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=1648)|
| 0:27:37| looking for innovative ways to, I guess, more aggressively meet our goals of sustainability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=1657)|
| 0:27:46| So thank you for listening to my comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=1666)|
| 0:27:51| Thank you, Council Member Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=1671)|
| 0:27:53| Council, I just want to say as far as our climate goals, which are ambitious and are fundamental to the future of our city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=1673)|
| 0:28:02| the Mayor's Climate Council has been meeting since early summer, and we are continuing to come up with plans on all the various sectors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=1682)|
| 0:28:12| And we will certainly bring recommendations and how we might integrate this into all of our decisions internally as a city and set goals for the community too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=1692)|
| 0:28:24| and have the action items oriented around them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=1704)|
| 0:28:27| So that is certainly something we're working carefully on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=1707)|
| 0:28:30| We expect to be able to bring some recommendations from that council to City Council in 2021, early 2021.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=1710)|
| 0:28:42| Any other questions or comments on the item before us, 9D?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=1722)|
| 0:28:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=1730)|
| 0:28:51| Council Member Singh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=1731)|
| 0:28:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=1732)|
| 0:28:53| I'm just wondering about Mr. Minol's statement that Planning Commission did not have any of these goals in mind,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=1733)|
| 0:29:05| or if they have been included in the sustainability talks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=1745)|
| 0:29:10| I don't want the climate goal to be just in a silo with the mayor's climate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=1750)|
| 0:29:15| I want to make sure that everybody is aware of what's going on and what we're going after.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=1755)|
| 0:29:21| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=1761)|
| 0:29:22| I couldn't agree with you more, Council Member Singh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=1762)|
| 0:29:24| And I will maybe set up an opportunity with Ms. Brooks to come share information and the goals with Planning Commission in the near future,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=1764)|
| 0:29:35| just to make sure they're all aware of them and can keep those in mind as they make their decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=1775)|
| 0:29:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=1782)|
| 0:29:45| Erin Gill, would you care to add to that a little bit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=1785)|
| 0:29:53| Only to say that I think your answer was very good, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=1793)|
| 0:29:56| Obviously, Amy Brooks is someone who we work very closely with on a regular basis and is in her role as interim director,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=1796)|
| 0:30:05| I think, pretty familiar with the city's sustainability initiatives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=1805)|
| 0:30:08| That said, I do agree that, Mayor, we'd love the opportunity to talk with Planning Commissioners specifically and bring them into the loop on what our goals are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=1808)|
| 0:30:17| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=1817)|
| 0:30:18| And just like City Council, there's a lot of new people who are new to Planning Commission as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=1818)|
| 0:30:24| So even though they might have been very well versed in it a year or so ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=1824)|
| 0:30:31| it's good to re-up that and share our progress and make sure everybody's on the same page about what these goals are and why we need to move forward on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=1831)|
| 0:30:39| Good suggestion. We'll add it to our list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=1839)|
| 0:30:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=1843)|
| 0:30:44| Any other comments or questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=1844)|
| 0:30:46| Council Member Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=1846)|
| 0:30:48| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=1848)|
| 0:30:51| I wanted to thank Mr. Mullins for sending us the email that he sent this afternoon with a few updates regarding the project and addressing our sustainability concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=1851)|
| 0:31:07| I was really appreciative to receive it and also some of the information that's provided in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=1867)|
| 0:31:15| One question that I did have in terms of the deed restrictions that are attached with this email,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=1875)|
| 0:31:25| it seems appropriate that we would try to capture some of our agreements in those deed restrictions as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=1885)|
| 0:31:37| One thought that comes to mind is having that access for our public transit on this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=1897)|
| 0:31:47| And again, these are early conversations, so we don't have a full sense of what that will look like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=1907)|
| 0:31:55| But it would be great for there to be, you know, space for a waiting area with a, what do you call it, shelter, which I think has been discussed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=1915)|
| 0:32:08| But is there a way for us to capture that in the deed restrictions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=1928)|
| 0:32:16| Thank you for that question, Council Member Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=1936)|
| 0:32:22| I don't know if the restrictions would be the proper place for that or if there's a subsequent development agreement that we may enter into with the city to address some of these other concepts that we're talking about during the design and the permitting phase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=1942)|
| 0:32:36| I know that's something that we have discussed being a potential, especially as we start looking more intently,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=1956)|
| 0:32:44| when we get more information with our engineering, our traffic impact studies as to what improvements will need to be made and how to go about doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=1964)|
| 0:32:52| I suspect there may be an opportunity to capture that in some other form.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=1972)|
| 0:33:00| I see Mr. Swanson's slides on. He may want to add to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=1980)|
| 0:33:05| Mr. Swanson, could you add to that, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=1985)|
| 0:33:09| Yes, I simply wanted to say that as far as Council Member Parker's suggestion, I think it's a good idea that we keep that in mind and find ways to make sure that the transportation facilities are available in this development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=1989)|
| 0:33:25| But deed restrictions are simply not the way to do that because the city is involved in providing this transportation, but the city would not be involved in any way in enforcing deed restrictions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=2005)|
| 0:33:37| Those are agreements between private parties and do not include the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=2017)|
| 0:33:41| And those private parties, frankly, would have no control over the ability to provide the public transportation facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=2021)|
| 0:33:49| So we can address that, but there's another vehicle to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=2029)|
| 0:33:53| And it's not the deed restrictions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=2033)|
| 0:33:56| Thank you, Mr. Swanson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=2036)|
| 0:34:00| Okay, any other questions or comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=2040)|
| 0:34:05| Okay, seeing none, Mr. Johnson, would you please conduct a roll call vote on 9-D?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=2045)|

| 0:37:58| It's part of the program that we're looking at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=2278)|
| 0:37:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=2279)|
| 0:38:00| Becky Wade, Director of Housing and Neighborhood Development for the City of Knoxville. This| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=2280)|
| 0:38:04| is the second round of emergency solutions grant funding through the CARES Act.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=2284)|
| 0:38:13| And the, for the first round, we've gone through a process to identify who will receive funding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=2293)|
| 0:38:26| through that allocation sent to us. But we have not, have not gone through that process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=2306)|
| 0:38:31| or we have for this one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=2311)|
| 0:38:34| We have gone through the application process and received nine different proposals from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=2314)|
| 0:38:43| eight organizations. All of those will be funded. And those agreements will come to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=2323)|
| 0:38:49| City Council in December. This is the first step for us to access the funds from HUD.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=2329)|
| 0:38:56| We have to make a plan change, basically, and add this money to our plan so that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=2336)|
| 0:39:04| can access it and then we can award those contracts and pay for the services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=2344)|
| 0:39:12| Okay. And one other thing that I wanted to clarify is back in June of this year, when| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=2352)|
| 0:39:23| we were considering the first round of funding, you had mentioned that we may receive additional| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=2363)|
| 0:39:32| funding from THDA. Is that separate from this funding? Did that ever materialize?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=2372)|
| 0:39:41| That funding is separate from this funding, and we have not received any funds at all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=2381)|
| 0:39:46| through THDA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=2386)|
| 0:39:48| Okay. Question. Okay. One other question. So, we learned of the 2.2 million CARES Act| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=2388)|
| 0:40:06| funding that we received. Is that separate from these two pots of money that we've been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=2406)|
| 0:40:14| discussing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=2414)|
| 0:40:15| That is this. This is the 2.2 million in ESG-CV Round 2 funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=2415)|
| 0:40:22| Okay. Perfect. It froze on me on this end, but I think I heard everything. Thank you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=2422)|
| 0:40:31| for the clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=2431)|
| 0:40:32| Okay. Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=2432)|
| 0:40:33| Thank you, Council Member Parker. Council Member Smith, you have a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=2433)|
| 0:40:36| Yeah, just a comment more so. These funds became available rapidly, and I just want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=2436)|
| 0:40:41| to commend Ms. Wade's team and Ms. Rust that worked diligently not only to distribute these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=2441)|
| 0:40:49| funds but to consider new applicants. And also, when speaking with them on a related| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=2449)|
| 0:40:57| note for similar processes, they've reduced barriers for recipients to receive these types| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=2457)|
| 0:41:04| of funds through creative ways with the Laws Forbidden Nonprofits, maybe not these funds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=2464)|
| 0:41:09| particularly, but they provided training for more grassroots-oriented nonprofits. And it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=2469)|
| 0:41:16| just reduced some of the barriers on the front end of types of support that providers can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=2476)|
| 0:41:21| play in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=2481)|
| 0:41:22| And then the third thing I wanted to just comment on is we don't typically have funding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=2482)|
| 0:41:26| for outreach. We usually have homelessness prevention and shelter, and those are included| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=2486)|
| 0:41:33| in this, but outreach is something we don't typically have funding for. And it's desperately| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=2493)|
| 0:41:38| needed as folks have across town, particularly I know in South Knoxville, outreach is extremely| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=2498)|
| 0:41:45| important where we have a gap. And I believe one of the recipients will have some outreach| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=2505)|
| 0:41:50| workers that can build some trust and help guide those experiencing homelessness to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=2510)|
| 0:41:58| resources that we have now. So, I just want to commend Ms. Wade's team for the nimble,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=2518)|
| 0:42:05| responsive way that they're going about this, and they're bringing on new folks to help| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=2525)|
| 0:42:09| people. So, just wanted to add that. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=2529)|
| 0:42:12| Thank you, Council Member Smith. Council Member Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=2532)|
| 0:42:16| Sorry, I have a question. I'm trying to keep all of these numbers clear in my head. So,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=2536)|
| 0:42:25| one other point of clarification, when the city announced that our homeless shelters| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=2545)|
| 0:42:32| had, you know, made some adjustments, and therefore, the homeless encampment at Blackstock| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=2552)|
| 0:42:40| was going to be closed, was that using any of these funds?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=2560)|
| 0:42:46| No, none of these funds before you tonight have been allocated through contract to anyone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=2566)|
| 0:42:54| at this point. All we're doing right now is submitting a plan to HUD so that we can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=2574)|
| 0:43:00| access these funds and subgrant them to agencies to provide services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=2580)|
| 0:43:06| So, do you know anything about the funding that the service providers have been provided| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=2586)|
| 0:43:14| to do the retrofits?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=2594)|
| 0:43:19| There will be some retrofits going to an agency out of this pot of money. And I'm trying to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=2599)|
| 0:43:30| think if in our first round of ESG, if we provided any retrofit funding, most of it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=2610)|
| 0:43:37| went for housing assistance payments for people who were to prevent homelessness. So, I know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=2617)|
| 0:43:47| Linda Russ is here. She may remember if we provided any funds for retrofits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=2627)|
| 0:43:54| We did. This is Linda Russ with Housing and Neighborhood Development. And we did provide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=2634)|
| 0:43:59| some emergency shelter and services funding to, I think, three different organizations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=2639)|
| 0:44:07| And one organization did use some money to purchase some beds. But I think the rest of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=2647)|
| 0:44:13| it was services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=2653)|
| 0:44:16| Got you. One reason I was asking is to see if we could get a report back on how funds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=2656)|
| 0:44:25| were used to retrofit and whether that increased the capacity of shelters, if it, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=2665)|
| 0:44:32| if you had any numbers around that. Anything that you know about the capacity of our shelters?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=2672)|
| 0:44:38| I'll be happy to get that information to you. I don't have it right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=2678)|
| 0:44:42| Okay. Thank you. Thank you, Ms. Wade. Appreciate it. Council Member Roberto, your mic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=2682)|
| 0:44:52| you're unmuted. Did you have a question or Ms. Singh?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=2692)|
| 0:44:54| Oh, no. I just forgot to unmute myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=2694)|
| 0:44:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=2697)|
| 0:44:58| So, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=2698)|
| 0:44:59| Okay. Yes, Council Member Singh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=2699)|
| 0:45:03| Since you brought up my name. Ms. Wade, it sounds like some of the money, there are some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=2703)|
| 0:45:09| decisions already made on where the money is going to be headed. Could you share that with us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=2709)|
| 0:45:15| what you do know?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=2715)|
| 0:45:18| I can. There are all the agencies that applied for funding are going to receive funds. We haven't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=2718)|
| 0:45:30| could completed negotiations with everyone at this point. So, I don't have the amount of funding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=2730)|
| 0:45:36| but I can tell you that some new organizations that applied will be receiving funding and those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=2736)|
| 0:45:42| include the Arts and Cultural Alliance, Connect Ministries, the Knoxville Area Urban League,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=2742)|
| 0:45:51| and then the homeless service providers that we have worked with for many years include| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=2751)|
| 0:45:57| Volunteer Ministry Center, CAC, Homeward Bound, Salvation Army, and the YWCA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=2757)|
| 0:46:08| Good work. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=2768)|
| 0:46:10| You're welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=2770)|
| 0:46:11| Can I add that this is Linda Rust again. Can I add that there are only certain component categories| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=2771)|
| 0:46:18| that can be funded with the emergency solutions grant funds. So, what you see before you are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=2778)|
| 0:46:25| amounts that we have estimated based on the applications and we rounded up, but those are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=2785)|
| 0:46:33| estimates for each of those component categories. So, street outreach, emergency shelter and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=2793)|
| 0:46:42| services, homelessness prevention, rapid rehousing, HMIS, and administration. Those are the component| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=2802)|
| 0:46:52| categories. So, we have those amounts that we rounded up based on the applications. And then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=2812)|
| 0:47:01| there was, I don't remember the exact amount, but I think there was some like 600,000 that was not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=2821)|
| 0:47:09| spoken for, but that we hope that we will be able to allocate for emergency shelter. So, over the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=2829)|
| 0:47:18| winter, when we anticipate that there will be more people moving into the emergency shelters,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=2838)|
| 0:47:26| we will have some funding that we can then use to help with a retrofits, as Councilwoman Parker| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=2846)|
| 0:47:33| was talking about, or any purchases that maybe need to happen. Or as we are hoping that maybe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=2853)|
| 0:47:41| we will have an agency or several that would come forward to possibly be interested in operating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=2861)|
| 0:47:51| shelter for families and for unaccompanied youth. So, we have some other ideas and other plans in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=2871)|
| 0:48:00| the works. So, it was nice to be able to have some of that money that we could hold over. So,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=2880)|
| 0:48:06| we'll have, you know, as the virus, you know, continues, you know, if it continues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=2886)|
| 0:48:14| you know, we will have some funds there that we can address needs as they arrive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=2894)|
| 0:48:18| Violetta Ilkiw, ACBP, CDBG Wonderful. Yeah,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=2898)|
| 0:48:21| families and youth definitely need some assistance with housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=2901)|
| 0:48:26| There are not many resources for that at all. Thank you, Ms. Rust.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=2906)|
| 0:48:30| Violetta Ilkiw, CDBG Thank you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=2910)|
| 0:48:31| Councilmember Singh. Any further questions or comments from Councilmembers? Councilmember| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=2911)|
| 0:48:37| Rogers. Violetta Ilkiw, ACBP| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=2917)|
| 0:48:38| I just would like maybe Ms. Rust or Ms. Wade, if obviously we find folks are having additional| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=2918)|
| 0:48:46| struggles due to COVID going on right now, which is why this funding has come through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=2926)|
| 0:48:50| If someone finds themselves in need and hasn't and doesn't know where to turn,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=2930)|
| 0:48:57| what are the suggestions? Is it to call 311? Is it to reach out to particular shelters?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=2937)|
| 0:49:04| If we were looking to give advice to someone in conflict direction?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=2944)|
| 0:49:08| Violetta Ilkiw, ACBP Yeah, we suggest everyone call 311 because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=2948)|
| 0:49:14| they handle the 211 system as well, which has many resources. They can provide a lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=2954)|
| 0:49:21| of information for where people can go for help. Violetta Ilkiw, ACBP| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=2961)|
| 0:49:25| Okay. I just wanted to make sure that was stated since we're talking about this is funding being| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=2965)|
| 0:49:30| available and if people know of groups or individuals that need it, where to refer them to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=2970)|

| 0:52:17| people come up to speak to us about some unfair wage or labor practices. And we were supposed to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=3137)|

| 0:53:00| where new fire buses are built. We did a thorough review. We sat down with the director of HR,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=3180)|
| 0:53:06| looked over EO, any EO complaints, looked over OSHA. So we also sat down at random with individual| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=3186)|
| 0:53:14| employees and had conversations with them as well, discussing the issues that they may be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=3194)|

| 0:53:33| Ms. Singh No, last time I had been contacted by a few| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=3213)|
| 0:53:37| people that did not contact me this time. So I'm not sure if it's resolved or not. But thank you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=3217)|
| 0:53:45| Mr. Thorne, for talking to people and trying to figure it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=3225)|
| 0:53:49| Violetta Ilkiw, ACBP Thank you. Councilmember Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=3229)|

| 0:53:57| I wasn't on Council at that time, but I remember there was a quite a discussion about the issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=3237)|
| 0:54:02| that Ms. Singh raised. There was a lot of interest on the previous Council. And I commend Mr. Thorne| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=3242)|
| 0:54:09| for following up on that and just not dropping the ball. And hopefully, the results of his| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=3249)|
| 0:54:16| conferences are correct, and that the people we're contracting in are treating their employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=3256)|
| 0:54:22| fairly. So thanks for addressing this. And I appreciate Ms. Singh bringing the issue up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=3262)|

| 0:54:35| Violetta Ilkiw, ACBP I appreciate Councilmember Singh bringing this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=3275)|
| 0:54:39| issue up because it's an issue that continues to concern me. I reached back out to folks who| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=3279)|
| 0:54:50| spoke out last December around this issue. And they describe an environment where the company| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=3290)|
| 0:54:58| continues to be hostile to its workers. For me, our follow-up from the last December meeting when| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=3298)|
| 0:55:08| this came before us, there was a commitment not only to, you know, visiting NSN and looking into| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=3308)|
| 0:55:21| matters. But also, it seemed like there was a written communication with certain expectations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=3321)|
| 0:55:33| and emphasizing our anti-discrimination policy. That seems like a worthwhile| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=3333)|
| 0:55:41| next step, in my opinion. But I will say it is difficult if our folks traveled there and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=3341)|
| 0:55:53| claim to not have seen any hostile work environment, which is, it's hard to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=3353)|
| 0:56:00| I imagine that's hard to witness in person in a short visit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=3360)|
| 0:56:05| So, I feel like, for me, for me, I'm not at a point where I can support this contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=3365)|
| 0:56:16| I don't feel like we've fully done our due diligence in this area. And it's a long-term,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=3376)|
| 0:56:26| it's a long-term, you know, not long-term in terms of, it's a big contract that will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=3386)|
| 0:56:41| have us committed to this company for some time. So, I'm struggling to support this and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=3401)|
| 0:56:50| I want us to do additional work that was committed to back in December to incorporate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=3410)|
| 0:56:59| you know, standards into our purchasing process that wouldn't allow, you know, a company that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=3419)|
| 0:57:09| creating a hostile work environment to even come to City Council. So, I'm not able to support it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=3429)|
| 0:57:16| tonight. And I want us to remain focused on how, I want us to recommit, you know, at the time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=3436)|
| 0:57:22| when this discussion was held, it was under a different administration. So,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=3442)|
| 0:57:26| now the new administration has to commit to initiating a process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=3446)|
| 0:57:32| where we look at how we can incorporate new standards into our purchasing process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=3452)|
| 0:57:38| Okay. Thank you. Ms. Parker, Ms. Singh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=3458)|
| 0:57:43| Thank you, Mayor. I think I am also going to vote no. I appreciate the visit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=3463)|
| 0:57:50| but it still concerns me that within, you know, less than a year, there's nothing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=3470)|
| 0:57:57| that everything has been fixed. The same way that we are very excited about East Town Mall giving| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=3477)|
| 0:58:02| jobs that are $15 an hour, we should also be, have the same standard for the people we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=3482)|
| 0:58:09| purchasing from or similar standard. So, I'm voting no because I want us to continue these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=3489)|
| 0:58:17| conversations and looking into this. Thank you. Thank you, Council Member Singh. Council Member| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=3497)|
| 0:58:27| Thomas. Yes, I agree. We should be continuing these conversations. I will be voting yes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=3507)|
| 0:58:35| of course. I don't know how the difficulty of verifying these kind of, I guess, mistreatment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=3515)|
| 0:58:46| of employees at another plant would be daunting. But if they are, you know, it would be great if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=3526)|
| 0:58:52| we could find out. I think at this stage, CAT probably made about the best overtures and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=3532)|
| 0:59:01| investigation they could. I don't know how much further they could go as far as verification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=3541)|
| 0:59:08| I think there was at least some value in approaching the company and having these discussions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=3548)|
| 0:59:16| So, I do appreciate the comments of my colleagues on the issue. And I do think it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=3556)|
| 0:59:25| an issue we should continue to have discussions on. It's an important issue. But on this particular| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=3565)|
| 0:59:31| vote, I'll be voting yes. Thank you, Mr. Thomas. Vice Mayor McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=3571)|
| 0:59:38| Yes, Mayor, thank you. And thank you, colleagues, for your comments. I'd like to ask Mr. Thorne,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=3578)|
| 0:59:46| in the due diligence, in the site visit and research of the company, were there any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=3586)|
| 0:59:52| EEOC complaints that were filed against the company? Or was there any evidence of that? Or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=3592)|
| 0:59:58| was that asked? If you're aware, you may or may not be aware of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=3598)|

| 1:00:10| letter that we wrote during that follow-up. And I don't believe there's any EEO complaints that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=3610)|
| 1:00:15| were filed with the company that we reviewed while we were there on site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=3615)|
| 1:00:23| Mr. Thorne, is there a more formal compliance report that you have? You know, it wasn't just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=3623)|
| 1:00:29| like a casual thing. There's a written report about the compliance. Could you speak to that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=3629)|
| 1:00:34| to share that with Council briefly? Yes, we can provide the written report that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=3634)|
| 1:00:39| our staff wrote up after, during their visit to the plant itself. Like I said, we looked at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=3639)|
| 1:00:46| their EEO report. We talked with the Vice President of Human Resources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=3646)|
| 1:00:51| We also looked at any OSHA complaints that have been filed with the company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=3651)|
| 1:00:56| And then, like I said, we also had random conversations with five different employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=3656)|
| 1:01:01| to discuss any issues that they may have. So that's what we did. Again, it was only two days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=3661)|
| 1:01:06| We weren't there for a couple months to talk to everybody. But we were there in the facility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=3666)|
| 1:01:13| doing our best, due diligence we could in the time that we had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=3673)|
| 1:01:17| Thank you, Mr. Thorne. Vice Mayor McKendry, did you have any further questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=3677)|
| 1:01:23| So what I will say about, you know, a lot of times on site visits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=3683)|
| 1:01:27| unless you just randomly walk up to someone and ask a couple of questions, if the employer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=3687)|
| 1:01:34| selects the people that you talk to, I will assure you that you will not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=3694)|
| 1:01:38| they will not select the people who have had issues with the leadership and management| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=3698)|
| 1:01:43| or the company. And so I'm not sure, you know, what that scenario looked like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=3703)|
| 1:01:49| Again, I do think it is concerning that, you know, we had people that were so upset about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=3709)|
| 1:01:54| the treatment that they drove here, just to speak to Council as relates to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=3714)|
| 1:01:59| What I would like to ask, Mayor, is what is the, or whomever can speak to this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=3719)|
| 1:02:05| if this were not to be passed, what would be the detriment to the equipment that we're trying to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=3725)|
| 1:02:16| adapt for in this resolution? Well, I mean, I think it would be a setback to our transit goals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=3736)|
| 1:02:24| and our sustainability goals and connecting people to opportunity and lowering our greenhouse| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=3744)|
| 1:02:29| gas emissions and that sort of thing. Anything that Mr. McClarn or Deputy Gill want to elaborate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=3749)|
| 1:02:35| on that? Please do. Sure. And I'm happy to take a pass at this, Deputy, to the Mayor Erin Gill| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=3755)|
| 1:02:42| and Isaac, please elaborate after I set the tone here. But I think the, you know, the critical| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=3762)|
| 1:02:46| piece here is that in order for us to achieve our sustainability goals and do the right thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=3766)|
| 1:02:52| as the transit industry shifts, we need to electrify our transit fleet to the most robust| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=3772)|
| 1:02:58| extent possible. And so, while the initial contract, our intention were to buy five buses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=3778)|
| 1:03:03| the contract allows up to 25. And if we are to execute that option, we're going to need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=3783)|
| 1:03:08| charging infrastructure that goes well beyond what we can do overnight at the Magnolia facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=3788)|
| 1:03:13| So, we are looking ahead under Isaac's leadership to say, where do we need on-route charging so that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=3793)|
| 1:03:20| buses can charge during the day as well as at night at the depot? And so, if we're going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=3800)|
| 1:03:25| expand our electric fleet, we need to make these adjustments as Isaac has identified in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=3805)|
| 1:03:31| contract, not only to the buses themselves as they come off the production line, but also invest in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=3811)|
| 1:03:36| that infrastructure at the beginning so that we're not then doing additional retrofits to upgrade| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=3816)|
| 1:03:41| that equipment knowing that we want to expand our fleet in the future. So, Isaac, please jump in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=3821)|
| 1:03:45| with any technical details that I might have missed. But I would say that this type of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=3825)|
| 1:03:49| infrastructure improvement and getting it right at the beginning, knowing that our plans are to expand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=3829)|
| 1:03:53| is really critical. Thank you. So, Mr. Tong, did you have anything you wanted to add?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=3833)|
| 1:04:01| Okay. It's 100 percent correct. We do not want to retrofit our fleets to do in-route or opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=3841)|
| 1:04:07| charging after the fact. After we get them back from the manufacturer, it's almost impossible to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=3847)|
| 1:04:12| do. We're going to run into a lot of complications if we try doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=3852)|
| 1:04:17| Thank you, Council Member Rodgers. Vice Member Kennedy, did you have a follow-up question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=3857)|
| 1:04:24| Last question. So, is this the most competitive price? Did this company have the most competitive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=3864)|
| 1:04:30| price? Mr. Stein? Yes, we, the council approved the contract back in December for us to purchase| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=3870)|
| 1:04:38| the buses off this contract. We have, what we have is an amendment basically to modify that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=3878)|
| 1:04:45| price to add this infrastructure that was included in the contract itself. So, this is an option,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=3885)|
| 1:04:50| basically, that we're exercising. But it is going to be amendment from the original contract that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=3890)|
| 1:04:54| the council approved back in December. All right. Thank you. Thank you, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=3894)|
| 1:05:03| Council Member Rodgers. Yeah. Mr. Thorne, so in our packet on page 373,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=3903)|
| 1:05:11| so we're using federal dollars to purchase these, correct? It's like federal, state dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=3911)|
| 1:05:18| So, we're required to follow these special DOL, EEO clause for construction projects,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=3918)|
| 1:05:26| which appears to be multiple pages that talk about discrimination, employee upgrading,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=3926)|
| 1:05:34| motion, transfers. So, there is a in-depth federal policy that ties to these funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=3934)|
| 1:05:42| Yes. Okay. I guess my concern is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=3942)|
| 1:05:48| the evidence that were presented that it is a bad or it is a good company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=3948)|
| 1:05:57| So, Mr. Thorne, you said when you guys went there, you, what Vice Mayor McKenzie brought up was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=3957)|
| 1:06:03| were you speaking with employees that the company selected for you? But what I heard you say was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=3963)|
| 1:06:08| that you randomly spoke to different employees throughout your visit. And you cited five random.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=3968)|
| 1:06:15| Correct. We randomly chose five different employees. These are not employees that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=3975)|
| 1:06:19| the employer recommended we speak to. These are ones we chose at random.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=3979)|
| 1:06:25| Okay. So, what we have is two alleged former employees came and spoke at the last council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=3985)|
| 1:06:32| meeting in December, where we actually voted and we approved this. And since then, we've heard from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=3992)|
| 1:06:38| no one. We've not confirmed anything about those that I'm aware of. And we've heard nothing else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=3998)|
| 1:06:48| And there are federal restrictions towards that kind of using this kind of funding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=4008)|
| 1:06:54| and having discriminatory hiring policies. I just don't feel like I have the evidence to say they're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=4014)|
| 1:07:00| bad company is where I'm concerned. Well, I completely agree with you, Council Member| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=4020)|
| 1:07:08| Ryder. And I want to assure council that we will not conduct business with, quote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=4028)|
| 1:07:13| unquote, bad companies, but bad companies who break the law or who are under suspicion of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=4033)|
| 1:07:20| breaking the law. That's why we, when I wasn't mayor at the time, but when the allegations were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=4040)|
| 1:07:25| made, they were taken seriously. And that's why Mr. Thorne and his team did do diligence before| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=4045)|
| 1:07:32| proceeding with this contract amendment. So, of course, we're going to check out and make sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=4052)|
| 1:07:39| we're in compliance with federal, state, and local law. And we did, I think, to go there to do a side| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=4059)|
| 1:07:49| visit to randomly interview five employees, not selected by the company, but just more random. I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=4069)|
| 1:07:56| mean, if someone has a complaint about that business, you know, they need to file their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=4076)|
| 1:08:02| complaint and follow the due process of law. And then we can find out about it. But if that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=4082)|
| 1:08:06| hasn't happened, we have no way beyond going, you know, the extra mile that Mr. Thorne and his team| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=4086)|
| 1:08:12| did to ascertain and verify that. And so every evidence that we have is that it's a reliable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=4092)|
| 1:08:18| company that's giving us the best value, that's helping us reach our sustainability and transit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=4098)|
| 1:08:23| goals. And I hope you all support it. Council Member Thompson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=4103)|
| 1:08:38| I can't hear you. Charlie, we can't hear you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=4118)|
| 1:08:41| Thank you. Yes, Mayor, to underline a bit what you just said, the first line of defense for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=4121)|
| 1:08:53| employees would be filing with appropriate state authorities and federal authorities. There's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=4133)|
| 1:09:01| laws designed to protect them. There's agencies on discrimination, labor violations, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=4141)|
| 1:09:08| And that would be an indication of how well this plant was doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=4148)|
| 1:09:15| If they were honest in turning over what kind of documentation along those lines| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=4155)|
| 1:09:20| that were involved in any activities, and they didn't, I don't know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=4160)|
| 1:09:28| how feasible it is to try to go deeper into investigating a particular| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=4168)|
| 1:09:34| plant. But that is the normal way of addressing these issues. Now, that doesn't mean that as a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=4174)|
| 1:09:45| city, we shouldn't be alert to these kind of practices and that we, of course, should follow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=4185)|
| 1:09:52| all the guidelines that we should. But I guess the point I'm making is the employees at the plant in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=4192)|
| 1:09:59| question, they aren't, hopefully, aren't defenseless. I guess people can question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=4199)|
| 1:10:04| about whether or not the agencies and the laws are effective and in fact protect. But that is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=4204)|
| 1:10:11| actually the part of the system that is supposed to address these. And we can supplement that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=4211)|
| 1:10:18| of course, as a city by monitoring those kind of issues that come before us. But without anything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=4218)|
| 1:10:26| more concrete, as far as evidence about mistreatment of the employees and the benefit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=4226)|
| 1:10:34| to the city of this proposal on sustainability and providing for our workforce and decreasing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=4234)|
| 1:10:43| traffic with public transportation, to me, it weighs pretty heavily in supporting this resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=4243)|
| 1:10:52| Thank you, Council Member Thomas. Council Member Singh?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=4252)|
| 1:10:58| Thank you, Mayor. During a quick search online, it seems like AFL-CIO filed a,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=4258)|
| 1:11:05| with the National Labor Relations Board in August. I know the internet is not the truth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=4265)|
| 1:11:13| but I looked at a couple of different sources. There was, there's enough out there that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=4273)|
| 1:11:19| I still think we should be looking into it in the future. And that's the hard thing. We have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=4279)|
| 1:11:24| to pay attention to climate. We have all of these different issues, but we can't do it on the backs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=4284)|
| 1:11:28| of other people. That's all. Thank you, Council Member Singh. Any further questions or comments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=4288)|
| 1:11:37| Council Member Parker? I was going to bring up something similar to Council Member Singh,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=4297)|
| 1:11:46| so I won't be repetitive. But I also just wanted to say that, you know, one of my asks was that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=4306)|
| 1:11:58| review our procurement process. And I'm concerned that the direction that the conversation has gone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=4318)|
| 1:12:06| in, that we feel good about our current procurement process, which gives us the cheapest option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=4326)|
| 1:12:16| Best value. I mean, in your opinion, right? But there are other community members who do not feel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=4336)|
| 1:12:23| like there are certain, once we weigh certain factors, that it necessarily is the best value| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=4343)|
| 1:12:32| for our community. One thing that Council Member Singh brought up in during the December meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=4352)|
| 1:12:38| is that our procurement process looks at reputational values. But Mr. Boyce was quick| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=4358)|
| 1:12:49| to, Mr. Evans, sorry, I'm getting a little old school, was quick to clarify that that is in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=4369)|
| 1:12:56| terms of the performance of the item that is being purchased. It is not, it has nothing to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=4376)|
| 1:13:03| with the reputation of the company. So, if we are, you know, concerned, not just with EEO| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=4383)|
| 1:13:10| complaints, but complaints going to Labor Board, et cetera, then we need to have that as a part| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=4390)|

| 1:13:25| VICE CHAIR TERRELL. Thank you, Mr. Parker. I think Sy McMurray with CAT is on the call and might| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=4405)|
| 1:13:32| be able to add some details about the process CAT followed. Mr. McMurray, are you, could you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=4412)|
| 1:13:41| speak to this and start by just giving your name for the record?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=4421)|
| 1:13:44| MR. MCMURRAY. Yes, ma'am, Mayor, members of City Council. I was one, I was part of the team that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=4424)|
| 1:13:50| went down. It was actually a pre-production meeting, two days, series of meetings, and I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=4430)|
| 1:13:55| had a breakout session, which I focused on those contract compliance issues as it related to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=4435)|
| 1:14:01| you know, equal employment opportunity and safety. I viewed their EEO1 report and some other reports| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=4441)|
| 1:14:08| related to the statistical area, and it showed that that fact is, it speaks to their hiring| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=4448)|
| 1:14:17| practices. They have a more diverse employee population in terms of minorities and females| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=4457)|
| 1:14:26| than that found in the area population as defined by the U.S. Census. Employees have three methods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=4466)|
| 1:14:33| to privately submit the EEO complaints and complaints of that nature that go directly to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=4473)|
| 1:14:42| human resources. Again, those are private means of doing it, one you can even do on your cell phone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=4482)|
| 1:14:47| On a smartphone. Another was with an express line. It was a computer kiosk, which sits outside of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=4487)|
| 1:14:53| cafeteria, the employee cafeteria. And there's the ethics hotline, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=4493)|
| 1:14:58| the 800 number, and all those go directly to the human resources department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=4498)|
| 1:15:03| The vice president of human resources, a fellow by the name of Herb Clark, he has been there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=4503)|
| 1:15:09| in human resources at that location for 20 years, and he has yet to receive the first EEO complaint| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=4509)|
| 1:15:19| in 20 years. And I know that the Jobs, Ways of America folks were concerned about really pushing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=4519)|
| 1:15:28| to try to bring about a community benefits program, that New Flyers should really pursue that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=4528)|
| 1:15:33| They are. They're just doing it with another organization. It's Transportation Diversity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=4533)|
| 1:15:38| Council. They had a lot of luck with that, a lot of success with that at another plant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=4538)|
| 1:15:42| one out in California. And where those efforts are focused on providing employment opportunities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=4542)|
| 1:15:50| for disadvantaged populations, single parents, homeless, previously incarcerated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=4550)|
| 1:15:57| folks from those populations. With regards to safety, of course, I looked at their OSHA 300| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=4557)|
| 1:16:04| report. I also looked at some stuff that's online, because all the OSHA stuff is public record,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=4564)|
| 1:16:10| you know, prior to when I went. In fact, the Jobs, Ways of America folks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=4570)|
| 1:16:16| they got an OSHA inspection that was initiated by the Jobs, Ways of America complaint,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=4576)|
| 1:16:22| and that was out there. There's no violations addressing immediate danger to life or health,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=4582)|
| 1:16:29| and no unresolved violations. The injuries they have, in fact, they had 19 injuries up to that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=4589)|
| 1:16:35| date, which are all cuts and strains. And all of which was well within the average for their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=4595)|
| 1:16:45| industry, because the online data provides that as well. They have a company safety council made| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=4605)|
| 1:16:52| up of volunteers from the different production line work cells, and 80% of the work cells are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=4612)|
| 1:16:59| represented. They also have a safety and quality assurance incentive program, in which work cells| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=4619)|
| 1:17:06| compete for recognition and prizes and awards. The next day, and I was the one who chose the five| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=4626)|
| 1:17:14| employees at random, and the human resources or safety folks weren't even around. I was with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=4634)|
| 1:17:22| pre-production meeting folks. They didn't even know what I was doing, you know, that I was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=4642)|
| 1:17:27| casually, I'd strike up a casual conversation with them at random, like I said, at five folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=4647)|
| 1:17:32| All of them expressed, you know, they said that they were glad to be back at work, and all of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=4652)|
| 1:17:38| them stated consistently that New Flyer was a good place to work. In fact, they'd even showed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=4658)|
| 1:17:44| me a report, New Flyer, the human resources folks did, that talked about, because the plant had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=4664)|
| 1:17:50| closed, you know, because of the pandemic. And they took a lot of steps to protect the employees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=4670)|
| 1:17:56| to bring them back to work. And they showed me results of a survey they did on how, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=4676)|
| 1:18:04| from the employees, their feedback on how well do you think we did in, you know, in making this a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=4684)|
| 1:18:09| safe place, given the pandemic, for you to come back to work. And it was overwhelmingly positive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=4689)|
| 1:18:16| that they, in fact, we had to go through training before we could even go down there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=4696)|
| 1:18:22| It was a one-hour training course we had to go through before we could go down there for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=4702)|
| 1:18:26| the meeting. So, it's a safe place. What I saw was a diverse workforce on the production line,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=4706)|
| 1:18:34| that was focused on quality of work, you know, and, you know, and gainfully employed. It looked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=4714)|
| 1:18:42| like a happy workforce to me, because coming from someone who's had 23 years in the military,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=4722)|
| 1:18:49| and 13 years here with CAT, managing people, and managing and motivating people. So, that's,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=4729)|
| 1:18:58| that pretty much summarizes my report. Thank you so much, Mr. McVeigh. That's very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=4738)|
| 1:19:02| enlightening. I appreciate all your work on this. Council members, any further questions or comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=4742)|
| 1:19:09| Seeing none, Mr. Johnson, would you please conduct a roll call vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=4749)|

| 1:21:00| 4, Article 2, Division 2, Section 4-73C of the Knoxville City Code to clarify that beer permittees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=4860)|
| 1:21:09| must comply with applicable regulations of the state of Tennessee and any other regulatory| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=4869)|

| 1:21:42| I just want to give, since I just added this to the agenda, I just wanted to give a few remarks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=4902)|
| 1:21:50| First, I want to say I'm so grateful for the work of our Health Department and our Board of Health.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=4910)|
| 1:21:58| They have been doing yeoman's duty, helping our community get through this pandemic. And I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=4918)|
| 1:22:03| grateful for the resolution this council passed a month or two ago, saying, expressing your support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=4923)|
| 1:22:10| for the Board of Health and the work of the health officials in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=4930)|
| 1:22:14| This measure tonight, I appreciate you considering it. It would give our community a new tool to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=4934)|
| 1:22:20| promote compliance with the regulations issued by the Board of Health. As I mentioned in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=4940)|
| 1:22:24| beginning of this meeting, our numbers look really bad. And the urgency of curtailing the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=4944)|
| 1:22:29| spread of COVID-19 is only increasing. I want to share with you just a short| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=4949)|
| 1:22:35| quote from the latest White House COVID-19 state report. It says that COVID in Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=4955)|
| 1:22:43| is aggressive, unrelenting, expanding, broad community spread across the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=4963)|
| 1:22:50| And evidence of improvement, there's no evidence of improvement, but rather further deterioration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=4970)|
| 1:22:56| And this is what I think is especially relevant. Current mitigation efforts are inadequate and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=4976)|
| 1:23:01| must be increased to flatten the curve to sustain the health system for both COVID and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=4981)|
| 1:23:06| non-COVID emergencies. So in speaking with the health department and with our law enforcement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=4986)|
| 1:23:13| it's clear that most businesses are working to follow the public health guidelines and to keep| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=4993)|
| 1:23:17| employees and patrons safe. And that is what containing the virus is necessary to help our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=4997)|
| 1:23:23| economy. That's a precursor to a good economy is good public health. Unfortunately, a small but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=5003)|
| 1:23:29| increasing number of businesses are choosing to ignore the curfew restrictions set in place by the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=5009)|
| 1:23:33| Board of Health. That is not okay. In addition to undermining our community's efforts to fight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=5013)|
| 1:23:38| the spread of COVID-19, allowing continued disregard by some businesses of the regulations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=5018)|
| 1:23:43| is not fair to the businesses that are following the law. Our economy does not benefit when there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=5023)|
| 1:23:48| an uneven playing field. So these ordinances would work together to clarify that beer permit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=5028)|
| 1:23:53| holders must comply with local health regulations, including the current 11 p.m. curfew.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=5033)|
| 1:23:58| So just as the cases for other beer permit violations, these ordinances would allow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=5038)|
| 1:24:02| enforcement through civil rather than criminal citations with potential revocation of beer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=5042)|
| 1:24:07| permits for businesses that repeatedly failed to comply. Navigating the pandemic is a new challenge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=5047)|
| 1:24:13| for all of us. And these are hard decisions. But as leaders, I hope you will join me in supporting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=5053)|
| 1:24:18| these two ordinances to address the crisis in front of us. We have several people available| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=5058)|
| 1:24:23| to answer questions, including Dr. Buchanan, Dr. Patrick O'Brien, who's an individual member of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=5063)|
| 1:24:31| Board of Health, and Charles Swanson for legal questions. And of course, Chief Thomas is here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=5071)|
| 1:24:37| for questions related to KPB. Any questions or comments, Ms. Testerman? You're still muted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=5077)|
| 1:24:46| Sorry about that. So I do have a couple of questions and some clarifications. You know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=5086)|
| 1:24:55| first of all, can you expound on how exactly this is supposed to work? Is it a one strike?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=5095)|
| 1:25:02| Is it a three strikes? Is it a verbal warning? You've got city courts that are closed if this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=5102)|
| 1:25:08| becomes a civil citation, you know. I'm going to let Mr. Swanson, since those are legal questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=5108)|
| 1:25:16| I'm going to let him answer that for you, Ms. Testerman. Mr. Swanson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=5116)|
| 1:25:21| So generally, the way this would work is, frankly, we're not really changing the law or clarifying the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=5121)|
| 1:25:28| law. Because what the law already says is that beer permittees have to comply with the law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=5128)|
| 1:25:34| And if they persistently refuse to comply with the law, that may serve as a basis for a suspension| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=5134)|
| 1:25:40| or revocation of their permit. And all these two ordinances really do is simply say that the law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=5140)|
| 1:25:47| includes those orders issued by the Board of Health.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=5147)|
| 1:25:52| Mr. Swanson, you froze up on us a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=5152)|
| 1:26:02| Maybe take your video off and just do audio.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=5162)|
| 1:26:12| Okay. Can you say, Mr. Swanson, are you still available?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=5172)|
| 1:26:16| Okay. We can hear you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=5176)|
| 1:26:21| All right. I do much better without video anyway. So what is the answer to your question? What| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=5181)|
| 1:26:33| happened? The officers would go out, whether or not the business is complying with the health| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=5193)|
| 1:26:42| department. If the business is not complying with the health department orders, then the officers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=5202)|
| 1:26:48| would locate whoever's in charge. Hopefully, it would be the permittee. Probably a lot of times| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=5208)|
| 1:26:53| at 11 o'clock at night, it may not be the permittee there. It will be the manager in charge. They are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=5213)|
| 1:26:57| required to have somebody in charge of their business. And so the officer would find the person| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=5217)|
| 1:27:03| in charge and issue a city citation. That is not a criminal document. It is a civil document rather| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=5223)|
| 1:27:12| than a criminal document. If they were charging them with violations of the Board of Health orders| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=5232)|
| 1:27:18| under the Board of Health, that would be a Class E misdemeanor, which is, in fact, a criminal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=5238)|
| 1:27:24| violation and potentially would have, you know, ultimately, somebody could be put in jail for that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=5244)|
| 1:27:31| down the road. In our citation process, that's not. The maximum fine for a civil offense is $50| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=5251)|
| 1:27:39| fine. So that's what would be faced by the person who got cited for the violation of violating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=5259)|
| 1:27:50| the Beer Code. Then what would happen? Nothing would happen with regard to a suspension or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=5270)|
| 1:27:56| revocation hearing at that point. It's only after there are repeated refusals to comply| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=5276)|
| 1:28:02| with the law that exists would then be undertaken to start the process for a suspension or revocation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=5282)|
| 1:28:11| hearing. And it would be sent to a individual hearing officer. It wouldn't come before city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=5291)|
| 1:28:16| council at the beer board. It would go to a hearing officer to determine whether the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=5296)|
| 1:28:23| repeated violations of the law would justify some type of suspension or revocation of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=5303)|
| 1:28:29| beer permit. So that's kind of the process that would be followed. Did that explain it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=5309)|
| 1:28:36| VICE CHAIR TERRELL. It does. You've got city courts that are closed right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=5316)|
| 1:28:39| VICE CHAIR TERRELL. You can still pay citations even though the courts themselves are closed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=5319)|
| 1:28:45| Isn't that right, Mr. Swanson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=5325)|
| 1:28:47| MR. SWANSON. Yes, they can still be paid. And we could work with the violator to see if some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=5327)|
| 1:28:59| agreement could be worked out. That's more than an actual trial. Usually all the courts, usually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=5339)|
| 1:29:07| what happens is, in this case, the law department would provide the prosecuting lawyer. And there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=5347)|
| 1:29:14| would be some determinations whether we could agree to some disposition of that citation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=5354)|
| 1:29:21| And it's probably what it would be would be some type of diversionary program for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=5361)|
| 1:29:25| where if they plead guilty, then after a significant period of time, there were no| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=5365)|
| 1:29:31| further violations, the citation would go away. That would not be atypical of how something like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=5371)|
| 1:29:37| that would be handled. However, if there are repeated violations, then we would have to move| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=5377)|
| 1:29:43| forward with potentially suspension of regulation here in Austin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=5383)|
| 1:29:50| VICE CHAIR TERRELL. I guess, I mean, I'm just, you know, I feel like I need to throw this out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=5390)|
| 1:29:55| there. You know, I really question, you know, where is the science that says people are catching| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=5395)|
| 1:30:01| COVID after 11 or from bars and restaurants, for that matter? And, you know, I really struggle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=5401)|
| 1:30:07| with creating a double standard and singling out a specific industry where at this point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=5407)|
| 1:30:13| there's no real scientific evidence to back it up. And do I wish people would comply so we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=5413)|
| 1:30:18| wouldn't have to spend this time and energy having the conversation? And, yeah, there are restaurants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=5418)|
| 1:30:24| and bars who are complying. I know they're frustrated, but they're more frustrated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=5424)|
| 1:30:29| you know, that they're not more relaxed capacity restrictions, quite frankly, because, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=5429)|
| 1:30:34| you know, there's no evidence to really corroborate that they're ground zero for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=5434)|
| 1:30:38| virus. And, you know, I've always thought I know this industry and, you know, they should be the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=5438)|
| 1:30:45| safest places given their oversight is conducted and protocols established by the health department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=5445)|
| 1:30:50| So many of these businesses are, they're already on life support. They're also employing students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=5450)|
| 1:30:56| who are working to pay for education. You know, this ordinance was originally targeted at roughly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=5456)|
| 1:31:02| a dozen businesses on and around UT's campus who have not been compliant. You know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=5462)|
| 1:31:08| those 17 to 25 across the state represent 1.67 of the COVID cases in the last two weeks or roughly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=5468)|
| 1:31:16| which is, you know, the age group representing the vast majority of patrons at the establishments not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=5476)|
| 1:31:22| complying. And in and around UT, that's, it's 0.23, which, you know, if you want to do the math,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=5482)|
| 1:31:30| makes campus seven times more likely. And I know there are arguments against that. But| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=5490)|
| 1:31:35| I just go back the likelihood of this demographic being responsible, you know, as super spreader and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=5495)|
| 1:31:44| it's tough. I mean, catering to the exception, you know, I have a problem with catering to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=5504)|
| 1:31:48| exception and not the rule. But the conundrum here is that no one really knows what the rule is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=5508)|
| 1:31:55| which is causing, I feel like, us leading by emotion versus facts. And that's my struggle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=5515)|
| 1:32:02| and concern. I don't trivialize this virus. It's real. I have an extraordinary amount of respect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=5522)|
| 1:32:10| and gratitude for Dr. Buchanan. I can't even begin to imagine having to be in this position| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=5530)|
| 1:32:16| at the time. I just, these kids are going home next week for two months. And, you know, my| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=5536)|
| 1:32:26| proposal, you know, I would say, I would like to see it taken off emergency because I also think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=5546)|
| 1:32:32| you have to talk to these establishments. They need to be communicated to. They need to understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=5552)|
| 1:32:39| what the rules and expectations are. Ideally, I'd like to see it postponed to January when kids are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=5559)|
| 1:32:46| back. I mean, it gives us two months, that population will largely be gone. And I also think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=5566)|
| 1:32:52| you know, shutting people down or complying to the 11 o'clock rule, it's just going to drive them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=5572)|
| 1:32:57| to go elsewhere and buy alcohol and go to other places that, I just don't think it's going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=5577)|
| 1:33:05| mitigate the problem. So I just, I wanted to share that. I also think it's difficult when you don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=5585)|
| 1:33:11| have a unified city and county government working together. You've got these businesses that truly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=5591)|
| 1:33:17| are abiding by double standards. So those are really my struggles and, you know, what I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=5597)|
| 1:33:26| having a hard time with. Thank you, Council Member Testerman. Dr. Buchanan, since you've taken your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=5606)|
| 1:33:32| precious time to participate in the City Council meeting tonight, if you could address the science| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=5612)|
| 1:33:37| of this law that has been passed by the Board of Health that we are trying to enforce. Just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=5617)|
| 1:33:45| talking about enclosed spaces and transmission from asymptomatic people, you know, those sorts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=5625)|
| 1:33:50| of things to help eliminate this, please. Sure. So thank you for considering this motion and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=5630)|
| 1:33:59| for allowing me some time. When we look at the evidence, the evidence is difficult in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=5639)|
| 1:34:04| situation because it's a new situation. However, there are a couple of MMWRs that have been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=5644)|
| 1:34:10| released that demonstrated in Arizona when they were having a spike. I don't remember when the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=5650)|
| 1:34:16| spike was, but when they were having a spike, it showed that when they took steps such as mask| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=5656)|
| 1:34:21| mandates and closing restaurants and bars, that it helped reduce the case numbers. You can really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=5661)|
| 1:34:31| see that they came down. In addition to that, another MMWR that came out, a large percentage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=5671)|
| 1:34:37| of cases, sorry, that's my dog, a large percentage of the cases that people who were positive had in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=5677)|
| 1:34:47| the two weeks before getting sick eaten out at a restaurant. So restaurants and bars are definitely| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=5687)|
| 1:34:53| places where we have transmission of COVID. Can we trace it back definitely in Knox County to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=5693)|
| 1:34:59| yes, these places are places where we have transmission? No, but we look at evidence from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=5699)|
| 1:35:05| across the country, which is really the evidence that we have available to us right now as others| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=5705)|
| 1:35:11| do that research and look at what's happened across the country. In addition to that, we certainly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=5711)|
| 1:35:16| know, as the mayor mentioned, you have spread from folks who don't know they're sick yet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=5716)|
| 1:35:22| and that certainly happens. And, you know, you can't eat and you can't drink if you have your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=5722)|
| 1:35:27| mask on. So that's one of the other challenges. It is challenging. I totally acknowledge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=5727)|
| 1:35:35| Councilwoman Testerman. It is challenging right now to figure out what the right thing to do is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=5735)|
| 1:35:39| to mitigate this problem. And so we are challenged with that and the Board of Health is challenged| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=5739)|
| 1:35:46| with that on a daily basis. But that's really all I have to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=5746)|
| 1:35:52| VICE CHAIR TERRELL. Thank you. Just to clarify the MMWR's morbidity and mortality weekly report| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=5752)|
| 1:35:57| that comes from the CDC. Is that right? Okay. Just wanted to clarify that for those of you who don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=5757)|
| 1:36:05| know that acronym. I'm not sure who raised their hand first. Vice Mayor McKendee and then Ms. Parker| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=5765)|
| 1:36:11| and then. VICE CHAIR TERRELL. I'll let Councilman Parker go first. I think her hand was up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=5771)|
| 1:36:18| VICE CHAIR TERRELL. Okay. Councilman Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=5778)|
| 1:36:21| COUNCILMEMBER PARKER. I wanted to add on the one thing that Dr. Buchanan said and then see if we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=5781)|
| 1:36:27| could pause for some clarification. One thing I wanted to add on that I've shared with the public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=5787)|
| 1:36:35| about, you know, where we're focusing our energy in terms of COVID and in terms of these restrictions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=5795)|
| 1:36:44| is one thing to remind folks of because a lot of people will bring up big box stores and Walmart| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=5804)|
| 1:36:51| and Lowe's and all of these stores have been open. One thing I like to remind folks is that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=5811)|
| 1:36:56| these are stores that hopefully, you know, the public is going into for a short amount of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=5816)|
| 1:37:02| And we have continually heard guidance that if you, you know, wear your mask, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=5822)|
| 1:37:10| follow the five core actions and you go into those stores and you're in there for a short| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=5830)|
| 1:37:14| amount of time, if you're in an indoor space for less than an hour, that's great. Ten minutes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=5834)|
| 1:37:19| even better. So, I think that's part of the reason why there's less concern. If folks are going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=5839)|
| 1:37:25| Walmart and hanging out and eating for an hour or more, it might be a concern. But I think it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=5845)|

| 1:37:38| if we could clarify, because I think it's really helpful and needed by the public, is what we are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=5858)|
| 1:37:45| able to do, you know, we can talk about as city council, we have even more limitations, but as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=5865)|
| 1:37:53| the city administration, because this, you know, I think this has been told to the public, but it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=5873)|
| 1:38:00| good to remind the public because early on, Mayor Kincannon was able to take executive action| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=5880)|
| 1:38:09| through an executive order, but that was taken away from the city of Knoxville. And so, now that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=5889)|
| 1:38:16| authority is within our health department. And so, I see this action regarding beer permits as one of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=5896)|
| 1:38:26| the few things that we could do. And that's one thing I wanted to clarify, like there, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=5906)|
| 1:38:33| we wouldn't, we as a city, please clarify if I'm wrong, would not, you know, under the governor's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=5913)|

| 1:38:50| We have some power over beer permit, but I do not believe it goes beyond that very much. Can we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=5930)|
| 1:38:57| clarify that? Ms. Parker, you're right. We have, I, as mayor, have authority over city property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=5937)|
| 1:39:03| and, you know, helping to make sure our city employees and people who are doing business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=5943)|
| 1:39:09| with the city are safe. But for as far as private entities, businesses, the authority to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=5949)|
| 1:39:17| exercise any sort of safety protocols is now with the Board of Health of Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=5957)|
| 1:39:24| which, of course, is our Board of Health. You know, it's Knox County Health Department and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=5964)|
| 1:39:29| Knox County Board of Health is what provides the health services to every single person| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=5969)|

| 1:39:39| rely on them to help us navigate this pandemic. So, you're exactly right. I did, the mayor of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=5979)|
| 1:39:43| Knoxville did have that authority, and it was taken away by Governor Lee in Executive Order| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=5983)|
| 1:39:48| 38 on May 22nd. If I, I think it's seared on my brain. I think that's the right date, but you're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=5988)|
| 1:39:55| right. Any further questions, Ms. Parker, or should we move to Vice Mayor McKenzie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=5995)|
| 1:40:02| That was my only clarification. Thank you. Vice Mayor McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=6002)|
| 1:40:07| Thank you, Mayor. Just want to, a couple of things I want to mention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=6007)|
| 1:40:12| When we talk about the science and the evidence around COVID, COVID is fluid,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=6012)|
| 1:40:16| and unfortunately, we're learning a lot of facts. After something has happened, after| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=6016)|
| 1:40:24| there's been a spread or after there's been a death, students going back home is a very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=6024)|
| 1:40:29| dangerous proposition because they may be going back home to family members that are elderly or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=6029)|
| 1:40:35| that have health issues. I think we would be remiss if we did not acknowledge as a council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=6035)|
| 1:40:43| that there are more people who are walking around asymptomatic than there are that have symptoms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=6043)|
| 1:40:51| And that is why it's so important that we continue to make sure that we are being safe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=6051)|
| 1:40:56| Anytime we're not following the protocols, wearing our mask, and your mask is down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=6056)|

| 1:41:05| So does that include sitting at a restaurant, putting your mask down, and you're not sitting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=6065)|
| 1:41:09| six feet away from someone? Absolutely. At a bar, and you're having a drink,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=6069)|
| 1:41:14| you're not going to be six feet away. For those establishments that are following the protocols,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=6074)|
| 1:41:20| that they're not serving after a lot of time, they have absolutely nothing that they need to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=6080)|
| 1:41:26| be concerned about. But do I feel like it is our responsibility if we have the authority to be able| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=6086)|
| 1:41:32| to help put some protocols in place that could potentially help save someone, even if they don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=6092)|
| 1:41:39| take it seriously? Absolutely, I'm in favor of that. I know of countless examples of people who| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=6099)|
| 1:41:45| have contracted COVID-19 at work from sitting across from someone having lunch. I also know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=6105)|
| 1:41:52| several examples of people that I know who have lost several family members due to gathering at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=6112)|
| 1:41:59| events, weddings, baby showers, other family gatherings. So again, I think everyone, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=6119)|
| 1:42:09| has personal opinions around COVID and what they're comfortable with and what they aren't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=6129)|
| 1:42:14| comfortable with. But I do feel like if we have the authority to be able to make a decision that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=6134)|
| 1:42:20| could help save some people, whether they want to be saved or not, or help them to be safer in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=6140)|
| 1:42:26| spreading it to their family members, I'm very much in favor of that. And it is very unfortunate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=6146)|
| 1:42:35| statement was made that there's double standards in the city and county are now on the same page.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=6155)|
| 1:42:39| And I think that's very unfortunate. But again, everyone does not view this pandemic in the same| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=6159)|
| 1:42:45| lens for various reasons that, you know, we can't at this point, you know, change people's opinions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=6165)|
| 1:42:53| I just hope that they are not made believers, because it affects them or someone in their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=6173)|

| 1:43:04| and will be supporting this ordinance on an emergency. I also want to commend Dr. Buchanan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=6184)|
| 1:43:11| and her staff for the work that they have done to try to help educate people. Also the access to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=6191)|

| 1:43:26| This pandemic, I think we all have seen and heard that there are second waves coming. We see cities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=6206)|
| 1:43:33| such as Chicago who are on a shutdown right now because of the surges. And so again, I think that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=6213)|
| 1:43:39| it is a travesty that the state of Tennessee is called out on national television that we had Dr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=6219)|

| 1:44:26| I'm a rule follower and I have a harder time with punishing the people who are playing by the rules| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=6266)|

| 1:44:45| when everybody else is adhering to the guidelines from the health department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=6285)|
| 1:44:51| My question for you, Mr. Swanson, I don't see you're on my screen, but I know you're lurking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=6291)|
| 1:44:58| out there. So if you don't even have to put on your screen, if you'll just answer my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=6298)|
| 1:45:05| I heard the, when Councilwoman Testerman asked for a question about what triggers the citations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=6305)|
| 1:45:14| I heard a couple. I think that is something that caused people some concern about what's the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=6314)|
| 1:45:23| subjectivity to when this might happen. How would this, you know, does this in any way impact their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=6323)|
| 1:45:32| beer permit than if they have someone carded? You know, we have the rolling, we just experienced it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=6332)|

| 1:45:53| pulled? I intend to support this in spirit. I do have those questions that I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=6353)|
| 1:46:03| I would like answered so that, as we said, people actually understand what this does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=6363)|
| 1:46:09| And I fully understand this is doing, this is not creating anything new. This is just saying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=6369)|
| 1:46:16| that in the city, we're going to use another enforcement mechanism that we have at our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=6376)|
| 1:46:23| disposal that the county does not because they can't create their own city ordinance. We can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=6383)|
| 1:46:31| So I'll quit rambling. Mr. Swanson, can you answer my question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=6391)|
| 1:46:37| I'll take an effort to answer your question. Can you hear me now, by the way?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=6397)|
| 1:46:44| Yes, we can. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=6404)|

| 1:46:51| by phone and it seems to be working all right. The real question is, could this impact someone's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=6411)|
| 1:46:58| beer permit? Yes, it could impact someone's beer permit. Because there is a provision in the code| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=6418)|
| 1:47:04| and when people sign up to obtain a beer permit, which is a privilege, it's not a right, by the way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=6424)|
| 1:47:11| it's a privilege to hold a beer permit. And the law is very clear that it's a privilege rather| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=6431)|
| 1:47:15| than a right. And when people sign up to obtain a beer permit, one of the things that they promise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=6435)|
| 1:47:21| that they will do is that they will comply with the law. And one of the provisions of the beer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=6441)|
| 1:47:27| code says, if you very consistently, repeatedly do not comply with the law, that is a basis under| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=6447)|
| 1:47:35| which your beer permit may be either suspended or revoked if you don't comply with the law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=6455)|
| 1:47:41| And so what will happen here is that using the usual enforcement methods that are used| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=6461)|
| 1:47:48| through the Inspections Bureau, I expect more than anything else, we will check to see whether| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=6468)|
| 1:47:53| these businesses are complying with the law. The law includes the Board of Health Regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=6473)|
| 1:47:59| And if they are not complying with the law, then a citation would issue. That will not necessarily,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=6479)|
| 1:48:06| at first citation, will not cause the beer permit to be either suspended or revoked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=6486)|
| 1:48:13| But if we go back time after time, and the business refuses to keep its promise and to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=6493)|
| 1:48:23| comply with the law as they said they would do, that will result in an action being taken by the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=6503)|
| 1:48:32| city to put that matter before an independent hearing officer and let the hearing officer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=6512)|
| 1:48:38| determine whether or not that business's permit should be either suspended or revoked. There's a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=6518)|
| 1:48:44| great deal of latitude given to the hearing officer, particularly with regard to the first instance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=6524)|
| 1:48:50| If they continue persistently over time to fail by the law, then I think you can expect that a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=6530)|
| 1:48:57| beer permit might be revoked by reason of that. So, does that...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=6537)|
| 1:49:02| Yes, sir. It does, but with a little nuance, if I may. So, I understand that. And that sounds like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=6542)|
| 1:49:10| that's an administrative decision. It's not a beer board decision. It is an administrative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=6550)|
| 1:49:15| decision that goes out and does citations. And administratively, somebody decides how many times| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=6555)|
| 1:49:21| is too many and then goes to a hearing office. My question is, we know if you sell underage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=6561)|
| 1:49:30| twice within a rolling two-year average, that triggers us coming before beer board and doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=6570)|
| 1:49:38| something. Would this citation fall into two mistakes within a rolling two-year average| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=6578)|
| 1:49:48| or is it totally separate? I think, I'm not saying they're not going to get in trouble| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=6588)|
| 1:49:54| either way, but I really think we need to be clear on that. Can somebody help me with that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=6594)|
| 1:49:59| For that, the automatic triggering has to do with sales to underage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=6599)|
| 1:50:03| Okay. This is a different thing than sales to underage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=6603)|
| 1:50:06| And so, it would not impact that at all? No, it does not impact the three-strike| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=6606)|
| 1:50:13| type deal. That's a different altogether. Okay. Thank you. I just, I really want us to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=6613)|
| 1:50:21| be clear about that when we're talking about that because I think the beer permit can get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=6621)|
| 1:50:26| kind of confusing for folks. So, thank you. Again, I will just say, and then I'll be quiet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=6626)|
| 1:50:33| this is not easy for me. I've loaned money to people. I understand how hard it is when you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=6633)|
| 1:50:39| close your business and I understand how hard it is when you don't have your revenue. All of us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=6639)|
| 1:50:44| even my nonprofit, we don't have the revenue we had. It's having horrible impacts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=6644)|
| 1:50:48| But a level playing field within the city is what we need. We cannot control what the county does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=6648)|
| 1:50:54| People, you know, the bars outside the city limits may continue to stay open. But I'm more on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=6654)|
| 1:51:02| I'm more for supporting a level playing field and it's not fair to the businesses who have been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=6662)|
| 1:51:07| complying to continue to allow businesses who aren't complying to a lawful order given by the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=6667)|
| 1:51:16| Board of Health. So, I intend to support this. Thank you, Council Member Fugett. I'll go to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=6676)|
| 1:51:21| Council Member Ryder and then Roberto and then back to people who have already spoken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=6681)|
| 1:51:26| Go ahead, Council Member Ryder. Yeah. So, I'm not sure that I have a great eloquent thing to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=6686)|
| 1:51:33| I want to echo some of the points that my colleagues have made. I hear from businesses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=6693)|
| 1:51:39| who are following the rules prescribed, which are emergency,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=6699)|
| 1:51:44| we're in a very unusual circumstance. And they, it's about the unlabeled playing field. They want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=6704)|
| 1:51:55| it to be fair. If they're going to comply with the rules, it's not fair that somebody else is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=6715)|
| 1:52:01| rogue and not following the rules. And that's one of the concerns that you hear. And I feel the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=6721)|
| 1:52:09| county, they certainly could follow suit and pass something similar and do exactly what we're doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=6729)|
| 1:52:16| and back up the Board of Health. That's a choice. None of us are arriving by these decisions easily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=6736)|
| 1:52:24| This is not one industry that's being targeted. We have other industries that the Board of Health| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=6744)|
| 1:52:31| hasn't even really talked about or had to, like Regal Theaters, the Bijou, the Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=6751)|
| 1:52:37| all our event spaces that have chosen to comply by literally shutting their doors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=6757)|
| 1:52:42| They're, all of our artists, tons of people that are, you know, the gig economy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=6762)|
| 1:52:50| Our economy is really being hit hard. And I think one of the things that I'd like to ask Dr. Buchanan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=6770)|
| 1:52:56| or Dr. O'Brien, who's on the call, when we see the numbers for every day reported by the Knox| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=6776)|
| 1:53:04| County Health Department of how many are hospitalized and they keep escalating, that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=6784)|
| 1:53:10| the number of Knox County residents that are hospitalized. So, could you comment on what the bed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=6790)|
| 1:53:16| capacities are at the hospitals? Would either of you be able to do that? Because I know the number| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=6796)|
| 1:53:22| that are, that my friends, my, you know, people that I know that work in the healthcare industry| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=6802)|
| 1:53:27| are actually treating is much higher than the numbers that we're surprised by,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=6807)|
| 1:53:33| you know, because we're not doing a regional reporting of what's actually in the hospital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=6813)|
| 1:53:39| Dr. Buchanan, are you still on the call?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=6819)|
| 1:53:42| Dr. Buchanan Actually, if you look at our website,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=6822)|
| 1:53:48| yeah, if you look at our website, you will see the regional numbers. They're not updated every day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=6828)|
| 1:53:54| but they're updated weekly. And so, those are the regional numbers that the graph at the bottom,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=6834)|
| 1:54:03| and that shows the regional numbers. And those regional numbers have been going up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=6843)|
| 1:54:09| I believe, most recent number was, I know it was over 200. It might have been closer to 300| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=6849)|
| 1:54:17| in the hospital with COVID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=6857)|
| 1:54:19| As of November 9th, I'm looking at it right now, the regional numbers were close to 300, 273.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=6859)|
| 1:54:27| Dr. Buchanan That number changes daily, as you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=6867)|
| 1:54:31| people come in and out of the hospital. But the, you know, the regional, the capacity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=6871)|
| 1:54:36| the hospitals continue to be able to operate within their current surge plans, with some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=6876)|
| 1:54:42| small alterations with their internal operations. You know, obviously, the concern is that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=6882)|
| 1:54:50| they'll reach beyond that capacity and have to, you know, change how they do business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=6890)|
| 1:54:57| which hurts their bottom line and hurts patient care as well. When they have to cut back on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=6897)|
| 1:55:03| you know, elective surgeries and other things, people don't get things done. And elective| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=6903)|
| 1:55:09| surgeries aren't necessarily just optional. They're just not emergent. And so we certainly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=6909)|
| 1:55:16| saw some, you know, folks who had waited last time when they shut down elective surgeries,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=6916)|
| 1:55:24| waited to get things done. And that wasn't ideal. And it's not ideal for the hospitals either to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=6924)|
| 1:55:30| that. So but if you want to see the regional numbers, they are only updated once a week, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=6930)|
| 1:55:35| they're on our website.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=6935)|
| 1:55:38| Okay. Thank you. And I just want to say in closing, we cannot improve our economy and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=6938)|
| 1:55:47| get our kids back to school, get my kids off my porch and back to school and all the other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=6947)|
| 1:55:51| things we need to do. My campus at Pellissippi is closed for the rest of the school year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=6951)|
| 1:55:58| My students at Pellissippi are suffering because it's very challenging for a lot of students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=6958)|
| 1:56:03| to do virtual. And we can't get back and we cannot get all of the other industries that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=6963)|
| 1:56:10| are shuttered back in business until we control this virus. End of story. And so the next phase| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=6970)|
| 1:56:16| once we get past this and we get vaccines is to encourage people to get vaccines. And so it has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=6976)|
| 1:56:22| been incredibly dismaying to see the politicization of this issue. And so I hope folks will not get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=6982)|
| 1:56:31| together with their families for Thanksgiving and spend some time walking in the woods and maybe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=6991)|
| 1:56:34| reflect upon that and how we're going to move forward. And the only other thing I'll say is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=6994)|
| 1:56:40| my mom did have COVID and she for about two weeks didn't know where she was or what was going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=7000)|
| 1:56:46| She was able to stay home. But when she finally came out of it, one of the first things she said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=7006)|
| 1:56:52| was, am I better? Am I okay? So it was an incredibly unpleasant experience for her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=7012)|
| 1:56:58| I have not seen her in person except from the top of her driveway. And she is afraid to go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=7018)|
| 1:57:05| anywhere now and have any socialization. And she's incredibly lonely because she doesn't feel perfect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=7025)|
| 1:57:11| or 100 percent. And she's afraid she'll get the flu or a cold on top of it and doesn't feel that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=7031)|
| 1:57:16| she can handle it. So, you know, we all want to move past this. And this effort is not to punish| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=7036)|
| 1:57:22| anyone. And the last thing I'll say is for the folks that want to email and say we should be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=7042)|
| 1:57:27| able to make our own choices and not have the government tell us what to do. We don't have time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=7047)|
| 1:57:31| tonight to sit here and, you know, list all the things the government tells us what to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=7051)|
| 1:57:35| from seatbelts to a litany of other things to wearing clothes in public. And I haven't seen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=7055)|
| 1:57:42| anybody show up and want to argue about that. So, you know, this is a temporary situation that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=7062)|
| 1:57:48| have right now. And it's just it's exhausting and we're all exhausted and we're all tired of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=7068)|
| 1:57:54| And we all want to move past it. And we're going to move past it faster when we all work together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=7074)|
| 1:57:58| VICE CHAIR TERRELL. Thank you, Council Member Ryder. Just a reminder, we do have Dr. O'Brien| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=7078)|
| 1:58:04| from the Board of Health. He's one of the members of the Board of Health. Dr. O'Brien is available| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=7084)|
| 1:58:11| to do you want to speak to this, you know, to help share with council members your insights?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=7091)|
| 1:58:18| DR. O'BRIEN. Yeah, I'll just thank you for allowing me to be here this evening. This is important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=7098)|
| 1:58:25| We don't have a lot that we can do in the way of regulations that I think can stick in this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=7105)|
| 1:58:33| community. We've all acknowledged that. It's difficult being in the middle of the pandemic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=7113)|
| 1:58:39| trying to read the science, deal with the public, people who, I hate to say, become experts after| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=7119)|
| 1:58:50| reading one post on Facebook or Twitter, and that we are trying to make the best decisions that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=7130)|
| 1:58:58| can. The decisions that we've made have been few and far between. Wear a mask. And we have put this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=7138)|
| 1:59:04| 11 o'clock curfew out there. Yes, I don't like it. It's not the best thing in the world. But you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=7144)|
| 1:59:10| know what? It's something we can do that affects one little segment that could potentially decrease| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=7150)|
| 1:59:16| the spread of this disease. People are less inhibited late in the evening when they drink.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=7156)|
| 1:59:25| Have we proven that there are spread in our bars locally? No. Have we seen it nationally? Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=7165)|
| 1:59:32| Data has shown that. I would strongly encourage us to follow this. I would strongly encourage any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=7172)|
| 1:59:37| county commissioners listening to the city council to replicate this so that we would be on an even| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=7177)|
| 1:59:43| footing across the county. And, you know, things are going to get worse here in the next days and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=7183)|
| 1:59:51| weeks. People really need to watch what they're doing at Thanksgiving. They need to really social| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=7191)|
| 2:00:00| distance, wear the mask, open the windows, and really minimize contacts. And I would just say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=7200)|
| 2:00:06| to everybody on the city council, everybody listening, that now is the time to really kind| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=7206)|
| 2:00:12| of pull back just a little bit and really think about what you're doing. When you go in somewhere| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=7212)|
| 2:00:17| and you touch something that somebody may have sneezed on or something, you need to, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=7217)|
| 2:00:22| put something on your hands and antibacterial lotion and deal with that problem. You need to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=7222)|
| 2:00:28| make sure you are wearing the mask when you're going to be potentially too close to somebody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=7228)|
| 2:00:34| And a contact is 15 minutes of exposure, non-consecutive, to one individual within six| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=7234)|
| 2:00:40| feet. So just kind of remember that. And I just encourage you to support this. We as the Board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=7240)|
| 2:00:49| of Health are here to support you and the rest of our citizens. We've had seven deaths reported| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=7249)|
| 2:00:55| today. We've had 33 in the first 17 days of this month, which is I think, if I remember correctly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=7255)|
| 2:01:02| is probably one less than our high for a whole month. So this is going to be really serious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=7262)|
| 2:01:08| By the end of this month, things are going to really be not looking so good. So we need everybody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=7268)|
| 2:01:12| to dive in and try to help with this problem. Believe in doing the right thing. And please| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=7272)|
| 2:01:20| stop thinking I, I, I. It's we, we the people. People are too much into individual liberty right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=7280)|
| 2:01:27| now. Let's kind of deal with us together, trying to get through this thing together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=7287)|
| 2:01:32| Anybody have any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=7292)|
| 2:01:33| VICE CHAIR TERRELL. Thank you so much, Dr. O'Brien. Appreciate your work on the Board of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=7293)|
| 2:01:42| Health and for the city of Knoxville. DR. O'BRIEN. Thank you so much. And I'll be here for any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=7302)|
| 2:01:46| questions or comments. VICE CHAIR TERRELL. Okay. Thank you. Council Member Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=7306)|
| 2:01:51| DR. SMITH. Yeah. I want to thank Dr. O'Brien. Dr. O'Brien, I know you're, you have had another| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=7311)|
| 2:01:59| job and that was a bar owner yourself. So I appreciate your perspective from a health standpoint,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=7319)|
| 2:02:05| but also as someone who ran a business that served alcohol and would have to abide by this if that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=7325)|
| 2:02:12| were still open. So thank you for that. I think you bring a good perspective from both of those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=7332)|
| 2:02:17| angles. You know, these, in times of uncertainty, we rely on experts to advise us. In this situation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=7337)|
| 2:02:23| that's the Board of Health. They've advised us that this is going to help curb this. And so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=7343)|
| 2:02:28| we owe it to them to lead. I know a lot of small businesses on Sevier Avenue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=7348)|
| 2:02:34| on Chapman Highway, and on Cumberland are abiding by the regulations. They are leading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=7354)|
| 2:02:40| And so while I appreciate and understand the businesses that are suffering collectively,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=7360)|
| 2:02:46| I also think those that are leading, we deserve to be backed up and those regulations applied| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=7366)|
| 2:02:53| equitably. So it's not fair to those who are struggling for we. And we'll be, I'll be voting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=7373)|
| 2:03:02| yes on this to support those who are. So that was just my comment. Thank you to Dr. Buchanan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=7382)|
| 2:03:08| Dr. O'Brien, for your leadership during this time. Thank you, Council Member Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=7388)|
| 2:03:13| Council Member Roberto. Thank you, Mayor. Director Swanson, I wanted to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=7393)|
| 2:03:19| go back just a minute and clarify something. So if without these two agenda items,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=7399)|
| 2:03:27| the enforcement piece of this would be a criminal prosecution, is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=7407)|
| 2:03:33| That is correct. We arguably could say that it's already against the law. And so we could do what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=7413)|
| 2:03:42| we're already doing with this. We're just giving people fair notice that the Board of Health| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=7422)|
| 2:03:46| Regulations are also the law. But if it's going to be enforced as a Board of Health Regulation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=7426)|
| 2:03:52| then it's a Class E misdemeanor. And that's a lower level of criminal offense, as opposed to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=7432)|
| 2:03:59| the civil offense that is presented by a violation of the city ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=7439)|
| 2:04:04| So I think that's an important point, is the items before us are making this a civil| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=7444)|
| 2:04:12| matter and not a criminal matter. So I think that's just a very important thing to make sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=7452)|
| 2:04:16| we clarify. The other item to that is that what you also said is, you know, there's an argument| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=7456)|
| 2:04:24| that the permittees are already subject to those rules. And this first item is just clarifying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=7464)|
| 2:04:34| that this is part of those rules because they've already agreed to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=7474)|
| 2:04:41| obey the state and local rules. Is that right? That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=7481)|
| 2:04:45| Okay. Then, you know, the next part that I have thinking about this, and I think this first item| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=7485)|
| 2:04:54| is just about that clarification. The second piece is how do you go through this process?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=7494)|
| 2:05:00| And so I just want to mention that I agree with what Councilmember Testerman said, too. You know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=7500)|
| 2:05:08| in a lot of the deliberations that councils had, one of the big items we've always talked about is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=7508)|
| 2:05:13| notice. And, you know, when we make this change and then we're looking at this piece, you want to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=7513)|
| 2:05:23| make sure folks have notice of what's going on. And so I don't know if Chief Thomas is available,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=7523)|
| 2:05:30| because maybe Chief Thomas would be best to ask this question, too. But| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=7530)|
| 2:05:34| what I recall is when the Board of Health initially came up with these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=7534)|
| 2:05:44| regulations, that the officers went out to establishments that were open past time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=7544)|
| 2:05:50| and there was a one sheet that the law department had put together, you know, letting them know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=7550)|
| 2:05:55| about what was going on and what the health board had come up with. Is that correct, Chief?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=7555)|
| 2:06:04| Yes, that's correct. And it went over the Tennessee law and how the Board of Health| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=7564)|
| 2:06:09| regulations were upheld through that Tennessee law and how we could enforce that. Again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=7569)|
| 2:06:14| that was criminally. And so there is a one-pager that was out there showing the business owners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=7574)|
| 2:06:19| and we had our inspections folks deliver it to every establishment that sells alcohol.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=7579)|
| 2:06:25| Okay. And so when, if this is to, if these items are to pass council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=7585)|
| 2:06:33| would you be going back out with another one-page, initially giving people a heads| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=7593)|
| 2:06:42| up on what's going on, giving them some notice like there was previously?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=7602)|
| 2:06:49| Yes, that would be our intention, because, you know, initially with that one-pager,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=7609)|
| 2:06:53| we got compliance. And that's what we want. We don't want to issue citations. We really just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=7613)|
| 2:06:57| want compliance. And so with that one-pager, we will, we would update that one-pager to include| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=7617)|
| 2:07:02| the city ordinance and how we would enforce that. You know, we would probably not begin| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=7622)|
| 2:07:08| with more warnings, but with that one-pager and then enforcement and then citations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=7628)|
| 2:07:13| Well, I would certainly want to see that we're giving some notice to folks right away,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=7633)|
| 2:07:22| especially since this has been put on the agenda on an emergency basis. So,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=7642)|
| 2:07:27| it's only getting voted on once. And so, and I certainly would want,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=7647)|
| 2:07:34| you know, my colleagues to talk to this point as well. But, you know, I do think giving folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=7654)|
| 2:07:40| notice is very important. And I would like to see the one sheets going out and delivered first| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=7660)|
| 2:07:48| before we're seeing citations going out. I know that's not up to council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=7668)|
| 2:07:56| but that would be certainly my preference to see that happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=7676)|
| 2:08:01| I'll just say that if council passes this tonight on an emergency basis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=7681)|
| 2:08:06| I'll make sure that those notices go out before citations are issued.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=7686)|
| 2:08:11| Okay. I appreciate that, Mayor. I do think that's important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=7691)|
| 2:08:15| The only, the follow-up question I had was to Dr. Buchanan. And I just wanted maybe your thoughts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=7695)|
| 2:08:25| on the urgency that we're in right now with regard to this particular piece that we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=7705)|
| 2:08:34| talking about this evening and these two items. So, as you've heard, our case counts are rising| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=7714)|
| 2:08:43| and our deaths are going up and our hospitalizations are going up. So,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=7723)|
| 2:08:46| there is an urgency to do something. You know, the challenge with these kinds of things is that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=7726)|
| 2:08:53| any action taken takes several weeks, two to four weeks to really show an impact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=7733)|
| 2:09:01| Our numbers go down much more slowly than they go up, unfortunately. So, you know, we would not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=7741)|
| 2:09:07| anticipate to see any improvement until, you know, in two, three or four weeks from now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=7747)|
| 2:09:16| And, you know, the challenges in between, we have Thanksgiving and lots of gathering happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=7756)|
| 2:09:22| So, I do think there is an urgency to doing something to try to lower our case counts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=7762)|
| 2:09:31| given our very recent increases in hospitalizations, deaths, and cases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=7771)|
| 2:09:38| Okay. And we also have heard tonight, and I know I've heard previously as well, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=7778)|
| 2:09:46| what does this look like with regard to the city participating here and the county not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=7786)|
| 2:09:54| Is there any lack of effectiveness because of that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=7794)|
| 2:10:00| Well, obviously, when we're looking at regulation, you prefer regulation to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=7800)|
| 2:10:07| equal across the board. But when I asked my staff to pull some numbers, and if you look at just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=7807)|
| 2:10:14| permitted facilities, and the city has 1,188 permitted restaurants and bars and 68 mobile| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=7814)|
| 2:10:23| units, and the county has 263 permitted restaurants and bars and 19 mobile units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=7823)|
| 2:10:32| And so, you know, the city definitely has the lion's share of permitted restaurants and bars,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=7832)|
| 2:10:38| which you all probably knew that. And so, you know, impacting those facilities potentially| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=7838)|
| 2:10:46| would have more of an impact. Ideally, you would have equal enforcement. And that's, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=7846)|
| 2:10:54| it's not ideal. It's not an ideal situation. Certainly, it is up to county commission and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=7854)|
| 2:11:03| or Knox County Sheriff's Office how they want to decide to enforce these regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=7863)|
| 2:11:09| Okay. And just the final thing I'll say is just a thank you to everybody for a really good| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=7869)|
| 2:11:15| discussion. And I know that this topic is very scary. And I know that I've had lots of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=7875)|
| 2:11:21| conversations with, you know, friends and also with my two daughters about this. It's a scary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=7881)|
| 2:11:30| situation. But what I want to let everybody know is that, you know, we're all going to work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=7890)|
| 2:11:35| together through this. We're all in this together. Okay. And it is something that we can do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=7895)|
| 2:11:43| We have faced challenges in the past. They were very significant. But this is one that we can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=7903)|
| 2:11:50| meet the challenge of today now, and we can do it together. So, I intend to vote for this as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=7910)|
| 2:11:56| Thank you. Thank you, Council Member Roberto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=7916)|
| 2:11:59| Council Member Parker and then Council Member Testerman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=7919)|
| 2:12:03| One thing I wanted to clarify following up on Councilman Roberto's questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=7923)|
| 2:12:09| The one pager that was shared with businesses, I just wanted to get a sense from you all why| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=7929)|
| 2:12:19| you feel that the civil penalty will help with compliance when the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=7939)|
| 2:12:28| the businesses were told about, you know, potential criminal, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=7948)|
| 2:12:39| gosh, it's getting late and I don't have any words left in my head. But it seems,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=7959)|
| 2:12:46| listening to that last conversation, it seemed like we were stepping back a bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=7966)|
| 2:12:52| We had it as a criminal offense. Now we're pulling back a bit to make it a civil offense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=7972)|
| 2:12:58| Council Member Parker, I think the main distinction is that it clarifies that it's not just a $50| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=7978)|
| 2:13:03| civil citation, but that your beer permit would be put at risk if you defy the Board of Health| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=7983)|
| 2:13:09| Regulation on beer regulations. So, that's the main difference. It goes from criminal to civil,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=7989)|
| 2:13:14| but the beer permit is part of the discussion now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=7994)|
| 2:13:18| Okay. So, we feel like businesses may comply more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=7998)|
| 2:13:31| Well, it's one thing losing $50 when you might be doing thousands of dollars worth of business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=8011)|
| 2:13:38| is one thing. Losing or putting at risk a beer permit is, you know, a different,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=8018)|
| 2:13:43| is more serious to a lot of people. And again, we don't take this decision lightly, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=8023)|
| 2:13:48| you know, it's an emergency situation. And, you know, that's why we are considering this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=8028)|
| 2:13:56| emergency effort to try to stem the tide and keep our hospitals running and keep our schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=8036)|
| 2:14:02| running as well and that sort of thing. I'm just, I'm trying to clarify based on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=8042)|
| 2:14:06| the conversation. It seemed like what was being discussed is that our businesses who get this beer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=8046)|
| 2:14:17| permit agree to follow state and local laws. And so, the language that we are adding in is a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=8057)|
| 2:14:28| clarification that the health board is creating laws that need to be followed. It seems like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=8068)|
| 2:14:39| if there's already a requirement that these health board regulations are followed as law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=8079)|
| 2:14:50| that that already threatened the beer permits of these businesses. Is that not correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=8090)|
| 2:15:00| I'm not sure what your question was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=8100)|
| 2:15:02| I'm kind of repeating what Roberto said, but just so that we can get clear. If we did not pass these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=8102)|
| 2:15:14| two ordinances tonight, businesses, when they get a beer permit, are still required to follow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=8114)|
| 2:15:23| local laws, which would include Board of Health regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=8123)|
| 2:15:28| Mr. Swanson, could you address that for Ms. Parker, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=8128)|
| 2:15:32| Well, yes, that is accurate. What the code already says is that beer permit holders agree| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=8132)|
| 2:15:39| when they get their beer permit, they are going to abide by the law. We are just making it abundantly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=8139)|
| 2:15:45| clear that state law allows the Board of Health to adopt these regulations, and that's complying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=8145)|
| 2:15:52| with the law. Our state legislature has adopted a law that says in emergency circumstances,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=8152)|
| 2:15:59| the Board of Health can make these regulations. And so, we are simply making it very abundantly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=8159)|
| 2:16:04| clear when the Board of Health does that in an emergency situation, that that would be a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=8164)|
| 2:16:10| violation of the law. I think you could reach that conclusion anyway without even having this change,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=8170)|
| 2:16:16| but it gives everybody absolutely fair notice and sort of takes away that argument if somebody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=8176)|
| 2:16:21| wants to argue that the Board of Health regulation is not really a law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=8181)|
| 2:16:25| Thank you for the clarification. I just, I was hearing something in the last discussion that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=8185)|
| 2:16:32| was a little different, and I just wanted to clarify that so that we weren't sending the wrong| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=8192)|
| 2:16:37| message to businesses and so we didn't see a headline tomorrow that says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=8197)|
| 2:16:41| you know, a criminal offense was changed to a civil offense in our attempt to enforce| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=8201)|
| 2:16:49| the Board of Health regulations. I wanted to clarify that, and I also wanted to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=8209)|
| 2:16:53| take this opportunity, while I have the mic, to say that I really encourage our counterparts in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=8213)|
| 2:17:01| the county on County Commission to take similar steps forward. A lot of the complaints that I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=8221)|
| 2:17:07| heard from the community was not having action from their legislative body, the County Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=8227)|
| 2:17:15| on this and on Board of Health regulations, and so I think it would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=8235)|
| 2:17:23| for the good of our, you know, entire community if we could join together as city and county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=8243)|
| 2:17:31| to clarify that Board of Health regulations are the law and to create ordinances when necessary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=8251)|
| 2:17:37| to just reaffirm that fact. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=8257)|
| 2:17:41| Thank you. Council Member Testerman, thanks for your patience. I know it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=8261)|
| 2:17:44| going to have your hand up a while.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=8264)|
| 2:17:50| Thank you. A few things. First of all, I know that we are, you know, talking about beer permit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=8270)|
| 2:18:01| but, you know, this doesn't impact should a beer permit be revoked. These establishments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=8281)|
| 2:18:12| still have their state ABC, which enables them to serve liquor and wine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=8292)|
| 2:18:18| Mr. Swanson, could you address that for us, please? Mr. Swanson, go on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=8298)|
| 2:18:25| I have to unmute myself. Could you repeat that question one more time? I didn't quite understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=8305)|
| 2:18:31| So, my understanding, and I'm pretty sure on this, is that should a beer permit be revoked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=8311)|
| 2:18:40| by the Beer Board, these establishments also hold an ABC license, which enables them to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=8320)|
| 2:18:45| serve wine and liquor. And that, in essence, would not be impacted unless there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=8325)|
| 2:18:54| some other enforcement that I'm not aware of. No, that is correct. The state has delegated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=8334)|
| 2:19:00| to the city authority only over beer. The wine and liquor is all regulated by the state,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=8340)|
| 2:19:08| pursuant to the TABC Board. And so, we don't have any regulation authority in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=8348)|
| 2:19:15| Right. So, again, I kind of go back, you know, does it really mitigate the problem? Because it's,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=8355)|
| 2:19:22| you know, margins are generally greater in liquor and, well, it depends. But at any rate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=8362)|
| 2:19:34| so I just wanted to bring that up. There are a couple of things I don't feel like that we've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=8374)|
| 2:19:39| come to, or that there have been any clear answers on when it comes to, back to, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=8379)|
| 2:19:46| with Beer Board. We know that there's one violation, there are two violations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=8386)|
| 2:19:51| if it's underage serving. We haven't come to any type of clarification. And I think any of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=8391)|
| 2:19:57| the establishments would need it as to really what this process is. Is it, you know, one site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=8397)|
| 2:20:04| is it a verbal, is it a citation, three citations, and then it goes in front of Beer Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=8404)|
| 2:20:12| And then, in addition to that, as an emergency ordinance, you know, what's this length of time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=8412)|
| 2:20:18| You know, I perceive this as a temporary ordinance. I understand we don't under,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=8418)|
| 2:20:24| we don't know how long the virus is going to stick around. But, you know, is it 30 days? Is it based| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=8424)|
| 2:20:32| on a certain number of cases, if we get below a certain number of cases? Because I don't feel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=8432)|
| 2:20:37| like that these establishments should, you know, penalize an 11 o'clock curfew. And I know this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=8437)|
| 2:20:44| goes back to the health board question. But, you know, what's the threshold? At what point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=8444)|
| 2:20:49| you know, these businesses would be able to get back to normal operations? Again, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=8449)|
| 2:20:57| my concern is these guys are already on life support. And, you know, to me, the residual| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=8457)|
| 2:21:02| impact of, you know, these businesses ultimately having to close is going to be, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=8462)|
| 2:21:09| a far greater. It's, you know, again, it's a lot of unknowns. And it's tough. But I don't feel like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=8469)|
| 2:21:16| there are any clear parameters around what's being put forth and what the expectations are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=8476)|
| 2:21:22| for any of these establishments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=8482)|
| 2:21:25| Council Member Esterman, what you're talking about there is the order of the Board of Health.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=8485)|
| 2:21:31| And we don't control how long the order of the Board of Health will remain in effect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=8491)|
| 2:21:36| That's their job to apply the science to it and determine how long the emergency situation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=8496)|
| 2:21:41| exists, how long they feel, in their expert opinion, it will be necessary to keep this in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=8501)|
| 2:21:48| place. Our job is simply to regulate BEER and to ask our permit holders to comply with the law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=8508)|
| 2:21:57| as the law exists.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=8517)|
| 2:21:59| Okay. Thank you. And I get the length of time. I'm just, again, I don't see any clear parameters| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=8519)|
| 2:22:11| about what the process would be for these establishments and how it's outlined.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=8531)|
| 2:22:18| Council Member Esterman, I think I just want to say that business people and economists| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=8538)|
| 2:22:25| and the Chamber of Commerce and other people throughout this county and city and this country| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=8545)|
| 2:22:30| and globe all agree that if you're worried about businesses and worried about people's ability to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=8550)|
| 2:22:38| earn a living, the number one thing to do is to get the virus under control. I mean, we talk about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=8558)|
| 2:22:44| businesses being on life support. We have, you know, people on life support. And we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=8564)|
| 2:22:49| the best way to help the economy and to get those economies and businesses back up and running at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=8569)|
| 2:22:54| full speed is to get this virus under control. And right now, it's way out of control. And so,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=8574)|
| 2:23:02| this ordinance that you all are considering isn't deciding what the epidemiology is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=8582)|
| 2:23:08| what the best decisions are. That's a doctor's decision. That's the Board of Health. And that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=8588)|
| 2:23:12| Dr. Buchanan and her team. We're just deciding how we can effectively enforce those laws for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=8592)|
| 2:23:18| best interest of our public health, which is a precursor and a necessary thing for our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=8598)|
| 2:23:25| economic health. I feel for the people who are struggling economically. But with people sick| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=8605)|
| 2:23:31| and without consumer confidence, the best thing to do is to control the virus. And that's going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=8611)|
| 2:23:38| to help our economy. And without it, our economy, our economic situation is going to get much more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=8618)|
| 2:23:43| dire. I hear that. And I appreciate that. I guess I'm going back to Council Member Roberto's point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=8623)|
| 2:23:51| of, you know, if we're going to hand a one sheet to these businesses, what's it going to say?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=8631)|
| 2:23:56| And what's the process going to be? And that's really what I'm trying to get at and understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=8636)|
| 2:24:03| exactly what provisions and what are the guidelines being put forth? And what's the adherence?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=8643)|
| 2:24:10| Well, we can, I'll ask Chief Thomas and her team of inspectors to put together the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=8650)|
| 2:24:17| one page and we can share it with Council. If that's, if you guys pass it, we'll be happy to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=8657)|
| 2:24:21| share it with you. Any further questions? Council Member Singh, did you have a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=8661)|
| 2:24:27| Thank you, Mayor. Yeah, I think it's a shame that we have to set a time limit rather than a behavior| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=8667)|
| 2:24:35| limit. You know, if there were businesses that were actually following rules inside,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=8675)|
| 2:24:41| then it would be based on an arbitrary time. I am worried about some of our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=8681)|
| 2:24:46| locally owned music venues that I don't know if they'll make it through this, the small places,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=8686)|
| 2:24:51| Pilot Light, some on Market Square, the Concourse. So, I do worry about, I mean, that's, we are going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=8691)|
| 2:25:01| to, this will be normal again one day, hopefully. And I'm hoping that we can do something to help| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=8701)|
| 2:25:06| these places survive because they're an integral part of our identity here. But as far as going by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=8706)|
| 2:25:15| behavior versus time, I don't want police in and out of every single institution to be checking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=8715)|

| 2:25:28| you know, I understand the 11 o'clock for that reason. That's all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=8728)|
| 2:25:33| Thank you, Council Member Singh. Council Member Hugate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=8733)|
| 2:25:35| Thank you, Mayor. I would just ask that in that one-pager there be some sort of numerical| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=8735)|
| 2:25:45| number of instances that would trigger a hearing officer kind of thing. The vagueness of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=8745)|
| 2:25:52| excessive abuse is too subjective, I think. I plan to support this, but that would be something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=8752)|
| 2:26:00| that I would ask be considered with the police chief. And I assume this will be complaint-based.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=8760)|
| 2:26:07| And other than that, since I got to talk, I'm going to call the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=8767)|
| 2:26:12| Okay. Council Member Hugate calls for the question unless there's any objection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=8772)|
| 2:26:17| We're seeing none. Mayor, Councilman Charlie Thomas is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=8777)|

| 2:33:15| recommending that denial of heavy industrial designation is appropriate since it does not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=9195)|

| 2:33:57| if you could start by stating your name and address for the record and you'll have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=9237)|
| 2:34:01| Yes, my name is Garrett Giles. I'm the current president of Hudson Materials Company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=9241)|
| 2:34:07| And I want to thank the Councilmembers. I've listened to pretty much your whole meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=9247)|

| 2:34:18| I think that's really neat. And thank you for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=9258)|
| 2:34:21| As in regards to our motivations and request to be rezoned heavy industrial at our property there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=9261)|
| 2:34:32| I will add to Councilman Thomas's point that the initial request was denied by the Planning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=9272)|
| 2:34:39| Commission. And then that with further review and discussion with the Board of Commissioners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=9279)|
| 2:34:46| our plan was, we received a heavy majority of the votes in favor of our request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=9286)|
| 2:34:58| And what we found is that they basically came to the conclusion that the zoning was not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=9298)|
| 2:35:04| fair and consistent with the neighboring properties in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=9304)|
| 2:35:10| We are looking to make capital improvements to our facility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=9310)|
| 2:35:19| and streamline that process. And we are unable to do so with our current zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=9319)|
| 2:35:24| These upgrades to our plant and equipment would be, you know, up with the current technology| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=9324)|
| 2:35:32| and safety standards. And, you know, we've operated at this facility for a number of years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=9332)|
| 2:35:39| We have not had a single complaint from the neighborhood or any of the neighboring| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=9339)|
| 2:35:44| resident properties there. In fact, until we were reapplied for the rezoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=9344)|
| 2:35:51| I really don't think most people even knew we existed there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=9351)|
| 2:35:55| And so, you know, we are looking to make these upgrades all within the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=9355)|
| 2:36:01| permitting regulations with the city. And again, we stand behind the request of the Planning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=9361)|
| 2:36:08| Board of Commissioners that voted 12 to 3, 15 to 0, and 15 to 0 in favor of our case,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=9368)|
| 2:36:16| because it seems that the zoning is not fair and consistent across the board, specifically to our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=9376)|
| 2:36:24| neighboring properties there. And that's really all we're asking is to allow this rezoning so that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=9384)|
| 2:36:31| we can make these necessary upgrades to our equipment and continue to operate at that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=9391)|
| 2:36:36| current location, hopefully for the next 50 years, like we have in the past. So, we had a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=9396)|
| 2:36:43| great meeting with the constituents in that area on Saturday. And I think their concerns are with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=9403)|
| 2:36:53| the zoning being tied to the property and not necessarily with what we're hoping to do. And,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=9413)|
| 2:37:00| you know, I think the fact that they had a pretty bad experience with a major fire,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=9420)|
| 2:37:06| you know, in the past. And I can totally relate and I understand their concerns about the zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=9426)|
| 2:37:12| that it's tied to the property and not to the business. But the upgrades that we are looking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=9432)|
| 2:37:18| to make are permanent and fixed assets that cannot be really moved to a new location. So,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=9438)|
| 2:37:28| you know, that's really what we're trying to do. We're hopeful that City Council will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=9448)|
| 2:37:34| recognize that and help us do that. So, with that, again, thank you for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=9454)|
| 2:37:41| And, you know, we'll see how things go, but we appreciate the consideration. So, thank you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=9461)|
| 2:37:47| Mayor, and to the rest of the City Council. It's been a pleasure hearing you guys debate and talk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=9467)|
| 2:37:55| about these very serious issues. And I'm happy that you saved the best for last. So, thank you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=9475)|
| 2:38:03| for that. And that's all I have for us. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Giles. We have also two speakers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=9483)|

| 2:38:30| live at 428 Burwell Avenue in Oakwood. Thank you, Council and Mayor, for allowing me to speak| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=9510)|
| 2:38:37| tonight. I previously served as President for the Oakwood Lincoln Park Neighborhood Association| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=9517)|
| 2:38:42| and Chair of the Code Zoning and Blight Committee. One of the main concerns of neighbors is industrial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=9522)|
| 2:38:49| zoning in our area. I'm speaking today about the Hudson Emulsions. I applaud the business for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=9529)|
| 2:38:54| wanting to upgrade their equipment and be a good neighbor. I cannot support a change to more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=9534)|
| 2:39:00| intense industrial zoning or changing the sector in one-year plans. There are several reasons I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=9540)|
| 2:39:05| cannot support these changes. The business does not own the land where they're requesting the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=9545)|
| 2:39:09| zoning change. It doesn't matter that they are a long-term renter. They can move with little| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=9549)|
| 2:39:13| repercussion. Keep in mind, the zoning stays with the property, not the business. The neighbor to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=9553)|
| 2:39:20| the north is a locomotive steam yard abutting the railroad. Saying that they have industrial zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=9560)|
| 2:39:27| we want it too, is not really an argument to me, given the rest that the neighborhood has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=9567)|
| 2:39:34| endured because of some of these industrial zoning issues. Heavy industrial zoning in densely| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=9574)|
| 2:39:39| populated areas is a problem. Commissioner Eason said that we should be moving toward the sector| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=9579)|
| 2:39:45| plan, not away from the sector plan. This is the wrong direction. Concerns that this business has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=9585)|
| 2:39:50| been there for 50 years can be countered with the fact that the residential housing has been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=9590)|
| 2:39:53| over 100 years. Things change, but our affordable housing is more of a crisis than ever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=9593)|
| 2:39:59| Several Victorian houses have been lost in that area in the last several decades since the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=9599)|

| 2:40:09| their business also. I appreciate the chance to review the property. It abuts to immediate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=9609)|
| 2:40:14| residential properties and quite a few more nearby. I'd like to point out that we didn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=9614)|
| 2:40:19| see the plan in operation. We were unable to discern if there were odors that impacted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=9619)|
| 2:40:22| near neighbors when they're operating. It certainly had a smell of asphalt, although| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=9622)|
| 2:40:26| it was their off-season. I also did never hear complaints about the business while I was working| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=9626)|
| 2:40:32| with the neighborhood. Staff recommended denial of... I'm having trouble hearing. Is it just me or...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=9632)|
| 2:40:39| Yeah, we can all hear pretty well, Mr. Thomas. I've been glitching, so...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=9639)|
| 2:40:47| Well, if you could work with Mr. Johnson on that. I'm sorry, Ms. Thomas, we won't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=9647)|
| 2:40:51| count this against your time. Oh, that's fine. I've been watching Charlie go in and out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=9651)|
| 2:40:56| so I know we're all having problems. I can hear the previous speaker fine,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=9656)|
| 2:40:59| so I don't know what's going on. Councilman Thomas, I'm going to disable your video.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=9659)|
| 2:41:05| That may be part of the problem. Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=9665)|
| 2:41:08| Audio only may be a good solution here. Okay. Okay, thanks, Ms. Thomas. Now, Mr. Thomas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=9668)|
| 2:41:16| Bev Thomas, will you please...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=9676)|
| 2:41:21| Lastly, if this business has been around for 50 years, they should have more than a one-year plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=9681)|
| 2:41:27| They should be able to work out a general timeline and work with the Board of Zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=9687)|
| 2:41:30| Appeals for their upgrades. If I understand correctly, there's no time limit for upgrades| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=9690)|

| 2:41:39| In closing, I'd like to say that I was first aware of industrial zoning issues in low-income areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=9699)|
| 2:41:43| during Danny Mayfield's day when he was running for mayor of Knoxville. He pointed out to me that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=9703)|
| 2:41:48| the interstate and James White Parkway provided extreme physical barriers between the haves and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=9708)|
| 2:41:52| the have-nots. There's more information out there now that points out these historical disparities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=9712)|
| 2:41:58| Please don't put further burdens on our low-income housing areas that increase adverse health| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=9718)|
| 2:42:02| incomes. Basically, I just want you to remember that the zoning states with the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=9722)|
| 2:42:09| this business does not own it. Please deny this request. I hope the business will prosper and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=9729)|
| 2:42:15| upgrade using the Board of Zoning Appeals. Thank you for your consideration and listening to me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=9735)|
| 2:42:20| tonight. Please be wise, safe, and stay well. Thank you, Ms. Thomas. The next person signed up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=9740)|
| 2:42:27| to speak also in opposition is Ms. Michelle Ivester. Ms. Ivester, are you on the call?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=9747)|
| 2:42:36| Yes, good evening. Can you all hear me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=9756)|
| 2:42:41| Yes, we can. If you could just start by stating your name and address for the record, and you'll| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=9761)|
| 2:42:44| have up to five minutes. Thank you so much. Michelle Ivester. I live at 1131 Chickamauga| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=9764)|
| 2:42:49| Avenue. I'm the current president of the Oakwood-Lincoln Park Neighborhood Association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=9769)|
| 2:42:56| Thank you again for this chance to voice our apprehension about the rezoning of 405 West| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=9776)|
| 2:43:01| Oldham. First and foremost, I want to thank Mr. Giles for his willingness to come to Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=9781)|
| 2:43:05| to hear our concerns and walk us through the site in question on Saturday. It was very enlightening| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=9785)|
| 2:43:11| and a great learning experience for us all. I'll try to be brief and concise. Rezoning from light| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=9791)|
| 2:43:17| industrial to heavy industrial is not a good option for this site for numerous reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=9797)|
| 2:43:22| Most importantly, because it goes against staff recommendations, and if we don't listen to our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=9802)|
| 2:43:27| staff, then what's the point of even having them? It does not meet the location criteria for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=9807)|
| 2:43:35| amendment. It's not consistent with the surrounding development, and it's in a designated floodplain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=9815)|
| 2:43:40| The business is currently located on site, but it does not own the property, as Ms. Thomas mentioned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=9820)|
| 2:43:46| that before, and that is a huge concern for us because, as you all know, the zoning does stay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=9826)|
| 2:43:50| with the property. Should the business decide to leave, even if it's no fault of their own,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=9830)|
| 2:43:55| the rezoning would remain and allowing for another possibly disastrous entity to move in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=9835)|
| 2:44:00| And last but not least, the current occupant is most likely able to make the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=9840)|
| 2:44:03| wanted improvements and upgrades without rezoning simply by asking for the variance when needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=9843)|
| 2:44:09| As we discussed with Mr. Giles on Saturday, we appreciate his wanting to make the improvements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=9849)|
| 2:44:13| and will support variances to help in his goals for making the business more energy and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=9853)|
| 2:44:18| environmentally sustainable. However, we cannot in good conscience support the request for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=9858)|
| 2:44:23| rezoning as it could possibly produce detrimental outcomes despite one's best intentions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=9863)|
| 2:44:28| Our neighborhood is still dealing with the aftermath of the fire at the Flower Facility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=9868)|
| 2:44:33| as was mentioned previously, and to have this zoning forced on us is just another burden that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=9873)|
| 2:44:42| we don't really need. So again, thank you for your time, and please deny this request for rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=9882)|
| 2:44:50| Thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=9890)|
| 2:44:50| VICE CHAIR TERRELL. Thank you, Ms. Ivester. Council members, that concludes all the people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=9890)|
| 2:44:55| who signed up to speak to this agenda item. So the agenda, the motion to deny is before you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=9895)|
| 2:45:04| Ms. Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=9904)|
| 2:45:04| MS. RYDER. Is Mr. Councilman Thomas not on the call any longer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=9904)|
| 2:45:09| VICE CHAIR TERRELL. Mr. Johnson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=9909)|
| 2:45:13| COMMISSIONER JOHNSON. He is not. He's dropped again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=9913)|
| 2:45:16| MS. RYDER. Mr. Johnson, is there a way for you to maybe get him on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=9916)|

| 2:45:25| continuing on with this. This is his district. He and I both were at the meeting on Saturday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=9925)|
| 2:45:31| and he's made the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=9931)|
| 2:45:32| VICE CHAIR TERRELL. I will step away and make a phone call and get him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=9932)|
| 2:45:36| MS. RYDER. Yeah. I appreciate it, and I apologize to everyone, Mr. Johnson. I'm sure we all agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=9936)|
| 2:45:45| Let's give him a minute to reconnect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=9945)|
| 2:45:54| Carly somehow dropped off the call again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=9954)|
| 2:45:59| Here, we can do like beer board, and he can just let Charlie talk on his mind. We had to do that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=9959)|
| 2:46:21| at beer board today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=9981)|
| 2:46:22| VICE CHAIR TERRELL. Yeah. Well, we could. We also have two people signed up for public forum. We| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=9982)|
| 2:46:27| could do those and then come back, but we'll give him another couple minutes to see if Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=9987)|
| 2:46:33| Johnson can figure this out. Unreliable Internet is a big problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=9993)|
| 2:46:58| MS. RYDER. Can you all still hear everyone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=10018)|
| 2:47:02| VICE CHAIR TERRELL. Michelle, we can still hear you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=10022)|
| 2:47:05| MS. RYDER. I wasn't sure if you could or not. So, just an interesting fact. I don't know if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=10025)|

| 2:47:39| Mayor, Councilman Thomas is having issues, and he's going to attempt to phone in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=10059)|
| 2:47:46| MS. RYDER. Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=10066)|

| 2:48:16| But it's in the corner, and we don't look at it very often, and I'm really negligent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=10096)|
| 2:48:22| about the messages. So, don't call me there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=10102)|

| 2:49:08| and it's working, obviously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=10148)|
| 2:49:10| MS. RYDER. Oh, so he's going to try to call into the Zoom on his cell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=10150)|
| 2:49:14| VICE CHAIR TERRELL. Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=10154)|
| 2:49:19| MS. RYDER.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=10159)|
| 2:49:20| Feel for him, because this is the most awful feeling, because when it happened to me right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=10160)|
| 2:49:24| before I vote, once I was panicked. VICE CHAIR TERRELL.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=10164)|
| 2:49:28| Yeah. I'll call him back in a minute, I guess, and here we go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=10168)|
| 2:49:34| VICE CHAIR TERRELL. Here we go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=10174)|
| 2:49:41| MS. RYDER. Yeah, my phone froze when we were approving the minutes, and it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=10181)|
| 2:49:45| made me a little panicky.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=10185)|
| 2:49:46| VICE CHAIR TERRELL. Councilman Thomas, I've enabled you to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=10186)|
| 2:49:51| You just need to unmute yourself. It's star six in your telephone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=10191)|
| 2:49:54| MS. THOMAS. Councilman, Councilmember Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=10194)|
| 2:50:00| VICE CHAIR TERRELL. Can you hear me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=10200)|
| 2:50:02| MS. THOMAS. We can. Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=10202)|
| 2:50:03| VICE CHAIR TERRELL. Okay. Fantastic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=10203)|
| 2:50:05| VICE CHAIR TERRELL. We just finished voting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=10205)|
| 2:50:06| MS. THOMAS. Everything that you wanted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=10206)|
| 2:50:09| happened, or I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=10209)|
| 2:50:11| VICE CHAIR TERRELL. Okay, that works. That works for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=10211)|
| 2:50:15| MS. THOMAS. No, I'm kidding. That's a joke. I won't put that in the minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=10215)|
| 2:50:21| Well, gee, it's on the table. The motion on the floor was to deny the request for an amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=10221)|
| 2:50:29| to the Central City Sector Plan, and it was seconded. And you've heard the speakers. Are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=10229)|
| 2:50:34| there questions or comments or further discussion by members of Council? Why don't we, did Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=10234)|
| 2:50:39| Thomas, just in case we lose you again, do you have anything you wanted to add right now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=10239)|
| 2:50:43| MR. THOMAS. I think I could go ahead and listen to my colleagues, but let me just say that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=10243)|
| 2:50:53| I guess the crux of it is changing the zoning to heavy industrial is against what the planning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=10253)|
| 2:51:03| staff had recommended, and I completely agree. And that runs with the property permanently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=10263)|
| 2:51:13| And no matter how good the present occupant is conducting himself, it doesn't mean that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=10273)|
| 2:51:21| the future should, and this is just not will, that the future will, and that this is just not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=10281)|
| 2:51:27| the proper location for heavy industrial. And then the other thing, which is very important,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=10287)|
| 2:51:35| is there's another avenue here for the applicant to go. He could go through the Board of Zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=10295)|
| 2:51:40| Appeals and ask for variances, and that's the way the system was set up. When a business owner had a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=10300)|
| 2:51:51| piece of property that wasn't zoned in a way that he liked, I suppose, he had another avenue to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=10311)|
| 2:52:02| accomplish what he wanted by going through the Board of Zoning Appeals and asking for variances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=10322)|
| 2:52:11| So, you know, denying him heavy industrial is not necessarily preventing him from continuing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=10331)|
| 2:52:19| his business and doing it in a certain way. So, I could say more, but that's two of the main| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=10339)|
| 2:52:26| pillars that I'm basing my motion for denial on. Thank you, Council Member Thomas. Council Member| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=10346)|
| 2:52:32| Smith, you had your hand up before. Go ahead. Thank you, Mayor. The variance plays a big role| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=10352)|
| 2:52:38| in this discussion, and I just wanted to know if maybe Peter Ahrens or Amy Brooks could speak to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=10358)|
| 2:52:44| how many variances have been requested by this applicant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=10364)|
| 2:52:48| maybe over the past year or two, or if anybody knows that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=10368)|
| 2:52:52| Amy Brooks or Brian Berry is here on behalf of Peter Ahrens today. Can Amy Brooks or Brian Berry,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=10372)|
| 2:52:59| can either of you answer that question? Sure, Mayor. This is Brian Berry. I'm with Zoning and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=10379)|
| 2:53:04| Development Services. I'm filling in for Peter. To our knowledge, the applicant has not made| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=10384)|
| 2:53:12| any application to the Board of Zoning Appeals for the existing property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=10392)|
| 2:53:20| And just, again, as kind of an understanding, the use is a non-conforming use, and it can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=10400)|
| 2:53:27| continue and be maintained. But any type of enlargement with regards to expanding capacity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=10407)|
| 2:53:35| on that piece of property would require them to go to the Board of Zoning Appeals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=10415)|
| 2:53:40| for an expansion or addition or alteration to the non-conforming use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=10420)|
| 2:53:47| But as of right now, we have not received any kind of application| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=10427)|
| 2:53:50| to the Board of Zoning Appeals for approval to do any type of expansion of that facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=10430)|
| 2:53:56| Thank you, Mr. Berry. And in this situation, would a variance that the applicant would apply for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=10436)|
| 2:54:02| be similar to the variances we consider where it's limited to topography or geographic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=10442)|
| 2:54:11| limitation? Or would this be a different type of variance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=10451)|
| 2:54:16| It would be a variance to expand a or alter a non-conforming use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=10456)|
| 2:54:25| And so there are some requirements that are laid out in Article 17 for the alteration or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=10465)|
| 2:54:31| enlargement of non-conforming uses. And it would be reviewed with regards to those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=10471)|
| 2:54:40| requirements in addition to kind of whatever the variance request that the applicant was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=10480)|
| 2:54:45| asking for. Okay. Because I think there's a general| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=10485)|
| 2:54:49| assumption that this applicant might receive that variance, but as we know, that's not promised. And| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=10489)|
| 2:54:54| so my first question was most important in the sense that they had already received a lot of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=10494)|
| 2:55:00| these variances that would provide a certain amount of understanding if they've been rejected| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=10500)|
| 2:55:05| in the past, that would provide some context as well. But to your knowledge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=10505)|
| 2:55:08| this applicant has not provided a variance for this type of situation in the past?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=10508)|
| 2:55:15| That's correct. I do not believe as far as our permitting system and what we could find is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=10515)|
| 2:55:20| there's any prior associated variances with the property. Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=10520)|
| 2:55:27| You're welcome. Thank you, Council Member Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=10527)|
| 2:55:30| Any further questions or discussion? Seeing none, please conduct a roll call vote. A yes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=10530)|
| 2:55:37| will be to deny the request. A yes vote. Councilman Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=10537)|
| 2:55:44| Yes. Councilman Fugate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=10544)|
| 2:55:48| Yes. Vice Mayor McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=10548)|
| 2:55:51| Yes. Councilman Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=10551)|
| 2:55:54| Yes. Councilman Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=10554)|
| 2:55:57| Yes. Councilman Roberto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=10557)|
| 2:55:59| Yes. Councilwoman Singh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=10559)|
| 2:56:02| Yes. Councilman Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=10562)|
| 2:56:04| Yes. And Councilwoman Testerman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=10564)|
| 2:56:07| Yes. Okay. The motion carries. And because the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=10567)|
| 2:56:15| item G was denied, the items H and I are moot because if you don't pass the sector plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=10575)|
| 2:56:25| this is from Mr. Swanson advised me of this, you can't pass a one-year plan if it conflicts with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=10585)|
| 2:56:32| the sector plan. So we're done with our agenda. And now we can move to public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=10592)|
| 2:56:41| Public forum, we have two people signed up. First person is Michael O'Malley. Mr. O'Malley,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=10601)|
| 2:56:45| are you on the call? Yes. Can you hear me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=10605)|
| 2:56:50| Yes, we can. Mr. O'Malley, please start by stating your name and address for the record,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=10610)|
| 2:56:55| and you have up to five minutes. Sure. My name is Michael O'Malley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=10615)|
| 2:56:59| I live at 2744 Woodbine Avenue. I am here to talk about affordable housing, basically. I've emailed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=10619)|
| 2:57:09| Vice Mayor McKenzie a couple of times about some of these concerns already, but I also just wanted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=10629)|
| 2:57:15| to address the whole council as well. So a couple years, so I live in the Chilhowee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=10635)|
| 2:57:25| neighborhood in East Knoxville, east of Park Ridge, of course. And I'm pretty concerned about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=10645)|
| 2:57:34| the situation regarding housing costs and housing prices here. So to start off, a couple years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=10654)|
| 2:57:41| there was on East 5th a house, a beautiful house renovated really nicely by the Knox Heritage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=10661)|
| 2:57:48| Foundation for sale. And my wife and I, we had already lived here several years, but we were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=10668)|
| 2:57:53| just kind of curious to see how the renovations had gone. So we went to the open house just to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=10673)|
| 2:57:58| look at it. And the agent who was showing the house, I guess, assumed that we were from outside| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=10678)|
| 2:58:02| of the neighborhood and was telling us about the neighborhood and assuring us that like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=10682)|
| 2:58:06| you know, don't worry, the neighborhood is going to change a lot in the next few years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=10686)|
| 2:58:10| And I'm not against positive change in the neighborhood, and there have been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=10690)|
| 2:58:14| several positive changes in the neighborhood. But the major change that I've seen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=10694)|
| 2:58:20| is that there's been a lot of inflation of housing prices. For example, when we moved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=10700)|
| 2:58:29| into the neighborhood five years ago, we bought the house that we live in right now, which is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=10709)|
| 2:58:33| three beds, two baths, 1,300 square foot. And right now, that house is valued unofficially| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=10713)|
| 2:58:44| at 150% of the price that we bought it for. Down the street a year ago, a two bedroom, two bath,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=10724)|
| 2:58:51| and 1,100 square foot house sold for $50,000 more than we paid for our house five years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=10731)|
| 2:58:58| And, you know, I mean, the simple fact is if we had been looking for a house now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=10738)|
| 2:59:05| in this neighborhood, or if the prices in our neighborhood had been the same| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=10745)|
| 2:59:10| five years ago as they are now, we couldn't have afforded to move into our neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=10750)|
| 2:59:15| And I can only imagine that that's true for many people. We're a house of two professional| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=10755)|
| 2:59:21| class jobs. I'm a teacher, and she's a social worker. And I'm starting to see a lot of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=10761)|
| 2:59:29| we buy houses signs, you know, which, you know, I, of course, realize are predatory on a certain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=10769)|
| 2:59:35| level. But I was curious, you know, what would happen if I called one? And I did. And the guy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=10775)|
| 2:59:41| on the other end was telling me about how, you know, working with him would be a win-win situation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=10781)|
| 2:59:46| for anyone looking to sell their homes because he wanted to buy up properties to expand his| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=10786)|
| 2:59:51| portfolio. And he also wanted to help people who were trying to get out of debt by selling off| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=10791)|
| 2:59:56| their house that they may not have paid for yet. And I don't see this as really a win-win scenario| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=10796)|
| 3:00:02| because he's praying for people who are struggling financially and taking what a lot of times is the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=10802)|
| 3:00:06| only source of generational wealth that a person has, which is the house. It's also not a win-win| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=10806)|
| 3:00:12| scenario for the city to, as I've seen in this neighborhood, allow for houses that are vacant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=10812)|

| 3:00:59| examples to say, like, I think that the city needs to take a more aggressive stance on intervening| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=10859)|
| 3:01:05| in the housing market in Knoxville in general, but specifically the East Knoxville area, which I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=10865)|
| 3:01:11| think is, you know, approaching a point of, you know, gentrification, of course. And I appreciate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=10871)|
| 3:01:16| all the affordable and public housing that's been built in Knoxville, as well as some of the relief| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=10876)|
| 3:01:21| given during COVID. And I don't – I'm not here to condemn that, but I think it's also not enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=10881)|

| 3:01:32| otherwise, it seems like Knoxville has taken a mostly laissez-faire approach to the housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=10892)|
| 3:01:36| market, and it's mostly allowed housing stock to be added to Knoxville at market rates or luxury| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=10896)|
| 3:01:43| apartments or developments made by developers. And I mean, as Amelia Parker posted on social media,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=10903)|
| 3:01:52| I think last week, that there was a Federal Reserve study done that found that just adding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=10912)|

| 3:02:01| affordability of housing in the city. And so, I guess my point is, like, I would like to see this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=10921)|
| 3:02:07| actually take aggressive interventionist action against the market rather than just allowing the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=10927)|

| 3:02:26| Okay. Sure. So, I mean, I think rent control is needed to stop inflation of rent as well as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=10946)|
| 3:02:33| requiring developers to make affordable housing even in downtown Knoxville and also housing for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=10953)|
| 3:02:39| the homeless and also allowing communities a chance to have community land trust and otherwise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=10959)|
| 3:02:43| for communities to have control over properties rather than developers. So, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=10963)|

| 3:03:19| health calls. I've personally talked to many of you via phone or email. I also spoke out against| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=10999)|
| 3:03:25| the co-response team proposed by Helen Ross McNabb and KPD that was passed by city council on July| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=11005)|

| 3:03:35| team. One of the reasons why I was so against the proposal was because it was rushed through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=11015)|
| 3:03:39| with little community input. Here we are almost four months later and we still have little| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=11019)|
| 3:03:44| information. I don't fault any of you for that, but I think it highlights why so many in Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=11024)|

| 3:04:38| with community providers that the service was being rolled out. I don't think anyone else in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=11078)|
| 3:04:42| the community really knew either. It's hard to understand why this program has so little| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=11082)|
| 3:04:46| transparency, because a program like this requires community support to be successful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=11086)|

| 3:05:01| response team in Knoxville that will improve outcomes for people in crisis. Beyond improved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=11101)|

| 3:05:17| for alternative response models. For example, U.S. Senator Ron Wyden from Oregon introduced a bill| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=11117)|

| 3:05:50| I think that clearly illustrates that Denver is fully supporting the CAHOOTS model after just a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=11150)|
| 3:05:54| few months of a pilot program. We all agree that more has to be done. I want to find a program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=11154)|
| 3:06:00| that will work best for the people who need it and for the city of Knoxville. As the budget process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=11160)|
| 3:06:05| begins, I hope that you will join me in asking for an alternative response team for Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=11165)|
| 3:06:09| I also look forward to the KPD workshop next month. Please ask for more transparency| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201117?start=11169)|
