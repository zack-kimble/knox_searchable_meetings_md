| 2:12:25| Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=7945)|
| 2:12:26| Chairman, can I say something just real quick?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=7946)|
| 2:12:29| John, when you're negotiating these, could you inform the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=7949)|
| 2:12:34| us on brokerage fees prior to getting to this point so that if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=7954)|
| 2:12:46| we feel that it's too much, we would at least have some say within| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=7966)|
| 2:12:49| that process?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=7969)|
| 2:12:50| Instead of it here at the 11th hour, we sort of feel like we got| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=7970)|
| 2:12:54| backed into having to approve it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=7974)|
| 2:12:56| Yeah, I certainly agree with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=7976)|
| 2:12:59| I was brought in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=7979)|
| 2:13:00| PBA was the lead negotiator of the lease, and they were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=7980)|
| 2:13:03| negotiating because the last time out, they owned the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=7983)|
| 2:13:06| Now we own the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=7986)|
| 2:13:08| They were negotiating on our behalf, and I entered into this very,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=7988)|
| 2:13:12| very late, I think in July.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=7992)|
| 2:13:14| So I'm at the last minute also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=7994)|
| 2:13:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=7997)|

| 2:13:35| Motion passed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=8015)|
| 2:13:40| Motion passes 17 to 2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=8020)|
| 2:13:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=8023)|
| 2:13:45| Go ahead, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=8025)|
| 2:13:46| Thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=8026)|
| 2:13:47| I would like to move to reconsider the vote on resolution 920| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=8027)|
| 2:13:56| about the donation and the amount of $10,000 from Chuck Jensen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=8036)|
| 2:13:59| because he is now in attendance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=8039)|
| 2:14:06| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=8046)|
| 2:14:08| Point of order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=8048)|
| 2:14:09| Wait a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=8049)|
| 2:14:10| What was that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=8050)|
| 2:14:11| That was never voted on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=8051)|
| 2:14:17| It was never.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=8057)|
| 2:14:18| It was actually voted not to be put on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=8058)|
| 2:14:21| It takes a two-thirds vote to be placed on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=8061)|
| 2:14:24| It did not get to 13 votes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=8064)|
| 2:14:25| I don't think we can discuss that at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=8065)|
| 2:14:27| Can we not reconsider that vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=8067)|
| 2:14:30| Mr. Law Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=8070)|
| 2:14:33| You can always reconsider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=8073)|
| 2:14:35| It requires someone from the prevailing side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=8075)|
| 2:14:39| It needs to be someone from the prevailing side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=8079)|
| 2:14:44| And the prevailing side said no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=8084)|
| 2:14:47| What was the vote on it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=8087)|
| 2:14:50| What number?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=8090)|
| 2:14:51| Vote to add it to the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=8091)|
| 2:14:54| It failed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=8094)|
| 2:14:55| 920.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=8095)|
| 2:14:56| 11-8, I think it was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=8096)|
| 2:14:57| It was the Chuck Jensen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=8097)|
| 2:14:58| 11-8.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=8098)|
| 2:15:03| It was never put on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=8103)|
| 2:15:05| Or would it simply just take.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=8105)|
| 2:15:06| I think it was 11-7.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=8106)|
| 2:15:07| The motion failed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=8107)|
| 2:15:10| It was 11-7.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=8110)|
| 2:15:11| I think we had one missing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=8111)|
| 2:15:13| Yeah, 11-7 and one abstained.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=8113)|
| 2:15:17| Not to put it on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=8117)|
| 2:15:22| Vote to add it to the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=8122)|
| 2:15:23| It failed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=8123)|
| 2:15:24| And it takes two-thirds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=8124)|
| 2:15:25| It takes 13, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=8125)|
| 2:15:28| Somebody from the prevailing side could offer it back up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=8128)|
| 2:15:37| Someone from the prevailing side can move to have it reconsidered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=8137)|
| 2:15:41| The vote was 11-7, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=8141)|
| 2:15:44| It had to be one of those seven.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=8144)|
| 2:15:45| And it had to be 13.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=8145)|
| 2:15:47| It had to be one of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=8147)|
| 2:15:48| 11-7-1, one abstained.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=8148)|
| 2:15:52| So one of the seven who voted against it would have to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=8152)|
| 2:15:56| No, it has to be one of the seven.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=8156)|
| 2:16:00| The seven won.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=8160)|
| 2:16:02| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=8162)|
| 2:16:03| No, the 11 won.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=8163)|
| 2:16:04| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=8164)|
| 2:16:05| The vote was to put it on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=8165)|
| 2:16:08| It failed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=8168)|
| 2:16:10| The people that voted, the seven of us that voted against putting it on prevailed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=8170)|
| 2:16:16| So they prevailed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=8176)|
| 2:16:17| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=8177)|
| 2:16:19| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=8179)|
| 2:16:20| As far as I understand it, one of the seven that voted against it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=8180)|
| 2:16:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=8187)|
| 2:16:28| I might reconsider it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=8188)|
| 2:16:31| Were you one of the seven?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=8191)|
| 2:16:32| Am I one of the seven?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=8192)|
| 2:16:36| You were the seven.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=8196)|
| 2:16:37| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=8197)|
| 2:16:41| Can't blame me for trying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=8201)|
| 2:16:45| It looks like another one o'clock if you all want to keep on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=8205)|
| 2:16:49| One of the seven, McKenzie, Campin, Norman, Hammond,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=8209)|
| 2:16:54| Roundtree, Lambert, and Dave Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=8214)|
| 2:17:01| Is anyone of the seven?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=8221)|
| 2:17:04| Hearing none, let's move on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=8224)|
| 2:17:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=8227)|
| 2:17:21| It might give that $10,000 for us to give around to our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=8241)|
| 2:17:25| 906.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=8245)|

| 2:17:46| Actuarial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=8266)|

| 2:17:48| Study to determine the liability associated with allowing members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=8268)|
| 2:17:51| with one-year service credit in the Tennessee Consolidated Retirement Credit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=8271)|

| 2:18:15| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=8295)|
| 2:18:16| Yes, I saw here that we're authorizing the cost of this study,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=8296)|
| 2:18:20| but I didn't see how much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=8300)|
| 2:18:22| What's the cost of this study?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=8302)|
| 2:18:24| I believe it's $300.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=8304)|
| 2:18:26| Is that, John, can you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=8306)|
| 2:18:27| It's very little.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=8307)|
| 2:18:28| I believe it's $300, $350.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=8308)|
| 2:18:30| It's in that range.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=8310)|
| 2:18:31| I just want to make sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=8311)|
| 2:18:34| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=8314)|
| 2:18:35| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=8315)|
| 2:18:36| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=8316)|
| 2:18:37| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=8317)|
| 2:18:38| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=8318)|
| 2:18:40| One no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=8320)|
| 2:18:42| Motion passes 18-1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=8322)|
| 2:18:51| Resolution 908 is requesting the Knox County Election Commission to determine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=8331)|
| 2:18:55| that petitions that embrace more than one subject are legally insufficient| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=8335)|
| 2:19:00| as they violate the Knox County Charter's procedure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=8340)|
| 2:19:03| and requirements prescribed for ordinances generally as outlined in the Knox County Charter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=8343)|
| 2:19:09| in Article II, Section 2.09A to and Article IX, Section 9.05B and 905C.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=8349)|
| 2:19:22| Intergovernmental.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=8362)|
| 2:19:24| 9-0 with no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=8364)|
| 2:19:26| Finance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=8366)|
| 2:19:27| No, no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=8367)|
| 2:19:30| Commissioner DeFries?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=8370)|
| 2:19:32| Yes, I move that we approve this resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=8372)|
| 2:19:37| I know that the Attorney General made, you know, he had an opinion that those petitions were valid| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=8377)|
| 2:19:47| because one pertained exclusively to the executive branch reorganization,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=8387)|
| 2:19:52| one to the legislative branch reorganization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=8392)|
| 2:19:54| But I really believe that that is not matching the spirit of what is in our charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=8394)|
| 2:20:02| And we took an oath to uphold our charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=8402)|
| 2:20:07| And I think that we can have a different opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=8407)|
| 2:20:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=8411)|
| 2:20:14| Do we have a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=8414)|
| 2:20:16| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=8416)|
| 2:20:17| We'll second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=8417)|
| 2:20:21| Can we talk in the microphone because we're recording?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=8421)|
| 2:20:24| Who's second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=8424)|
| 2:20:26| Commissioner Pinkston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=8426)|
| 2:20:27| Commissioner Pinkston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=8427)|
| 2:20:29| Are there any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=8429)|
| 2:20:31| Mr. Law Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=8431)|
| 2:20:36| May I ask your opinion on it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=8436)|
| 2:20:41| It hasn't changed for months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=8441)|
| 2:20:46| It's the same as it was whenever we reviewed the petitions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=8446)|
| 2:20:50| and when they were submitted to the Election Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=8450)|
| 2:20:54| It's the same as which actually after we approved of the petitions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=8454)|
| 2:21:04| the Attorney General weighed in to an opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=8464)|
| 2:21:07| I don't know who requested that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=8467)|
| 2:21:09| Someone did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=8469)|
| 2:21:11| And it applied specifically to Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=8471)|
| 2:21:14| And the Attorney General agreed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=8474)|
| 2:21:20| I'm not aware of an attorney that disagrees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=8480)|
| 2:21:24| There may be one here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=8484)|
| 2:21:25| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=8485)|
| 2:21:26| Let me ask you a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=8486)|
| 2:21:28| Has the State Attorney General ever been wrong on an opinion to Knox County?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=8488)|
| 2:21:34| It's almost laughable, isn't it, except it's not all that funny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=8494)|
| 2:21:39| Yes, they have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=8499)|
| 2:21:41| And attorneys are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=8501)|
| 2:21:43| We're in somewhat of a humbling profession.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=8503)|
| 2:21:47| But in this instance, you've had petitions that have gone through a process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=8507)|
| 2:21:56| We've discussed the reasons that we believe they are not violative of the charter requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=8516)|
| 2:22:03| Those reasons have also been expressed by the AG.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=8523)|
| 2:22:06| I tend to agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=8526)|
| 2:22:10| I don't believe that the petitions as they exist with the Election Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=8530)|
| 2:22:17| that are being signed by 40-some-odd thousand Knox Countians are in violation of the Knox County charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=8537)|
| 2:22:26| Is there any way at all to find out through a court before the election takes place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=8546)|
| 2:22:33| so we don't spend $80,000 taxpayer money to get through this election,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=8553)|
| 2:22:38| and somebody passes, somebody files suit that says that it's against the charter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=8558)|
| 2:22:43| and then it comes out that it is against the charter, it shouldn't have been on the ballot?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=8563)|
| 2:22:47| Is there any way to find out before the election so the people in Knox County won't have to endure costs on both sides?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=8567)|
| 2:22:57| I mean, citizens may wish to bring suit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=8577)|
| 2:23:06| You would have to sue the Election Commission, probably the state AG.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=8586)|
| 2:23:13| You'd have all kinds of folks involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=8593)|
| 2:23:21| Nothing short of a lawsuit, certainly, would resolve it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=8601)|
| 2:23:25| And I don't know that that could get accomplished prior to November 4th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=8605)|
| 2:23:29| That's the only thing that concerns me, because there's people who have strong feelings on both sides,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=8609)|
| 2:23:35| and, you know, whoever wins, whoever loses is probably going to try to do something after the election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=8615)|
| 2:23:40| And we can't prevent every lawsuit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=8620)|
| 2:23:42| I mean, I was in court a week ago, and we heard a local attorney declare that persons who were serving,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=8622)|
| 2:23:51| who were going to serve two days before September 1, that that would count as a term of office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=8631)|
| 2:23:59| And I believe the court found that that reasoning was absurd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=8639)|
| 2:24:05| But it's hard to stop those kinds of lawsuits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=8645)|
| 2:24:10| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=8650)|
| 2:24:11| Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=8651)|
| 2:24:13| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=8653)|
| 2:24:15| Mr. Law Director, will you account or recount specifically the legal bodies that have said that these petitioners are doing as they think they're doing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=8655)|
| 2:24:33| Which bodies have spoken to this already?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=8673)|
| 2:24:36| I know the Election Commission, the attorney who advises the state election coordinator,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=8676)|
| 2:24:44| the state election coordinator, the Attorney General's office, and myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=8684)|
| 2:24:48| So all these people feel this is a valid process and it should proceed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=8688)|
| 2:24:53| That the petitions that are filed with the Election Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=8693)|
| 2:24:57| the orange petition and the white petition are not violative of our charter requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=8697)|
| 2:25:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=8703)|
| 2:25:04| On the basis of that, I would like to make a substitute motion that this resolution be denied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=8704)|
| 2:25:09| Do we have a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=8709)|
| 2:25:11| I'll second it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=8711)|
| 2:25:14| Do we have a substitute motion on the floor that this motion be denied?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=8714)|
| 2:25:21| Everyone ready to vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=8721)|
| 2:25:22| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=8722)|

| 2:25:36| Kingston, DeFries, Lambert, and Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=8736)|
| 2:25:54| Motion denied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=8754)|
| 2:25:56| Motion, substitute motion is accepted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=8756)|

| 2:26:25| Consideration of a resolution requesting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=8785)|
| 2:26:28| and encouraging the appropriate officials of the University of Tennessee Administration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=8788)|
| 2:26:33| and the Board of Trustees to reject the proposal to eliminate the UT Department of Audiology| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=8793)|
| 2:26:42| and Speech Pathology.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=8802)|

| 2:26:55| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=8815)|
| 2:26:56| We have a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=8816)|
| 2:26:58| Commissioner, you made a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=8818)|
| 2:27:00| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=8820)|
| 2:27:01| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=8821)|
| 2:27:02| We have someone here from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=8822)|
| 2:27:04| Do you have a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=8824)|
| 2:27:06| We don't need any.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=8826)|
| 2:27:07| Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=8827)|
| 2:27:08| I just wanted to speak to it just briefly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=8828)|
| 2:27:12| I appreciate the commission's interest in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=8832)|
| 2:27:14| Several of us have a personal interest and have expressed approval in the resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=8834)|
| 2:27:20| I'd like to remind the commission this is not a moot point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=8840)|
| 2:27:23| even though there's been a significant momentum gathered by Mr. Silverstein| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=8843)|
| 2:27:28| and his group of concerned citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=8848)|
| 2:27:31| This group is cautiously optimistic in their success,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=8851)|
| 2:27:37| and we want to be sure that neither the Department of Audiology and Speech Pathology,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=8857)|
| 2:27:44| its academic degree program, or its clinical services will not be diminished in any way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=8864)|
| 2:27:49| And this is what the continued effort's about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=8869)|
| 2:27:52| So I'd like for Larry to come forward and speak, if he'd like to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=8872)|
| 2:27:58| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=8878)|
| 2:27:59| I'll be very brief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=8879)|
| 2:28:00| I'm here today representing the many thousands of East Tennessee supporters of the UT Department of Audiology| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=8880)|
| 2:28:05| and Speech Pathology and its clinical programs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=8885)|
| 2:28:08| which provide essential speech and hearing services to thousands of children| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=8888)|
| 2:28:12| and adults from 25 counties in East Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=8892)|
| 2:28:16| Thousands of professional speech pathologists and audiologists have been trained| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=8896)|
| 2:28:20| during the 55-year history of this nationally acclaimed program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=8900)|
| 2:28:24| As you are aware, in June, university administrators proposed eliminating the entire department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=8904)|
| 2:28:29| and all of its clinical services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=8909)|
| 2:28:31| Since then, the community has expressed its outrage at this proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=8911)|
| 2:28:36| Last week we learned that some progress has finally been made,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=8916)|
| 2:28:39| and we are cautiously optimistic that a satisfactory resolution to this issue may be achieved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=8919)|
| 2:28:44| However, we are very concerned that any proposed solution must not diminish the academic and clinical programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=8924)|
| 2:28:51| We simply have not received any assurances that these programs will continue in the present form.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=8931)|
| 2:28:58| I would like to thank the Knox County Commission for its consideration of this resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=8938)|
| 2:29:02| Your approval of this resolution would send a strong message to the university administration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=8942)|
| 2:29:07| and the Board of Trustees, on behalf of all of the citizens of Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=8947)|
| 2:29:12| that this entire department must be maintained| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=8952)|
| 2:29:15| and adequately funded for the benefit of all East Tennesseans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=8955)|
| 2:29:19| I thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=8959)|
| 2:29:23| We have a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=8963)|
| 2:29:25| Mr. Chairman Strickland, may I say just one thing about this program?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=8965)|
| 2:29:29| My name is Mike Brown, 7320 Twin Creek Road, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37920.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=8969)|
| 2:29:35| I've been a patient in the program over there for the last 20 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=8975)|
| 2:29:39| And I can attest to the fact of the type and quality of treatment that goes through there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=8979)|
| 2:29:47| Every time I go over, I see not only adults, but I also see little children,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=8987)|
| 2:29:53| that you can tell by, you know, the big thick glasses that that's not the only problem that they have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=8993)|
| 2:30:01| And the work that they do there, as he said, is nationally renowned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=9001)|
| 2:30:05| They come here from all over the United States and the world to be trained over there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=9005)|
| 2:30:09| So I would encourage anything we could do to maintain this program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=9009)|
| 2:30:15| We have a motion on the floor to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=9015)|
| 2:30:19| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=9019)|

| 2:30:24| I work there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=9024)|
| 2:30:26| And one abstention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=9026)|
| 2:30:28| Motion is approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=9028)|
| 2:30:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=9032)|

| 2:30:59| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=9059)|
| 2:31:00| I just would like to say that I should probably withdraw this because I think he's probably already left for the day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=9060)|
| 2:31:06| but he did give you, it should be in your packet, some information about where we are on how far TRAIN has come| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=9066)|
| 2:31:14| with regard to our energy audit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=9074)|
| 2:31:16| They've done, I think, approximately ten schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=9076)|
| 2:31:18| and they're in the process of doing all the sheriff's facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=9078)|
| 2:31:22| And so this is actually, we're actually farther ahead than where I had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=9082)|
| 2:31:30| So you want to withdraw it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=9090)|
| 2:31:31| Yes, I'd like to withdraw it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=9091)|
| 2:31:33| Need a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=9093)|
| 2:31:34| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=9094)|
| 2:31:35| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=9095)|
| 2:31:36| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=9096)|
| 2:31:37| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=9097)|
| 2:31:38| Withdrawn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=9098)|

| 2:31:55| Page 28, 918.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=9115)|
| 2:31:57| It's requesting the Industrial Development Board of the County of Knox,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=9117)|
| 2:32:01| to hold a workshop to discuss, review, receive public comment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=9121)|

| 2:32:24| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=9144)|
| 2:32:25| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=9145)|
| 2:32:26| Hold on a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=9146)|
| 2:32:29| It's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=9149)|
| 2:32:30| I just wanted to say that the Industrial Development Board of Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=9150)|
| 2:32:33| at their last board meeting, had requested I try to arrange,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=9153)|
| 2:32:37| or our chair tried to arrange a workshop in October.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=9157)|
| 2:32:40| And I have, on behalf of Suzanne Shriver, the IDB chair,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=9160)|
| 2:32:45| sent a request to Chairman Strickland to be able to have a meeting like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=9165)|
| 2:32:51| like is being requested in October.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=9171)|
| 2:32:53| So I would assume that information will be getting out to you all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=9173)|
| 2:32:58| and letting us know as to what date would work best for your schedules| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=9178)|
| 2:33:03| and certainly work to accommodate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=9183)|
| 2:33:06| Do you have a question, Commissioner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=9186)|
| 2:33:08| Is there any way you can do that in September, like late September?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=9188)|
| 2:33:13| Just see if you can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=9193)|
| 2:33:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=9194)|
| 2:33:15| We'll see what we can do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=9195)|
| 2:33:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=9196)|
| 2:33:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=9197)|
| 2:33:18| I've got one question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=9198)|
| 2:33:19| Check your message board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=9199)|
| 2:33:20| It will be coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=9200)|
| 2:33:21| Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=9201)|
| 2:33:22| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=9202)|
| 2:33:23| Todd, is there any people that's filed the application, I mean the funds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=9203)|
| 2:33:29| to have you all here from anyone that's applying for a TIF?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=9209)|
| 2:33:34| Is there a certain time limit now that's in place?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=9214)|
| 2:33:39| There is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=9219)|
| 2:33:41| Back a month before last, the county committee, excuse me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=9221)|
| 2:33:48| the county IDB voted to hold off taking any action on TIFs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=9228)|
| 2:33:52| until there was a chance to review the policies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=9232)|
| 2:33:55| to have a chance to bring the new Industrial Development Board appointees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=9235)|
| 2:34:00| up to speed on the program to consider some proposed changes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=9240)|
| 2:34:05| as well as to have a chance to address the new members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=9245)|
| 2:34:09| who are coming on to the Industrial Development Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=9249)|
| 2:34:12| And there are two applications,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=9252)|
| 2:34:15| or there's two that are out there right now that are wanting to be heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=9255)|
| 2:34:21| Yes, but do you all have a time limit when somebody files for an application?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=9261)|
| 2:34:27| Is this going against your policies for putting this out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=9267)|
| 2:34:34| No, I don't think it's going against their policies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=9274)|
| 2:34:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=9277)|
| 2:34:38| I didn't know if you had a rule like they had to be heard within 90 days of filing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=9278)|
| 2:34:42| There are some time limit requirements on the applicant once they are heard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=9282)|
| 2:34:48| to submit an economic impact plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=9288)|
| 2:34:52| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=9292)|
| 2:34:55| We have a motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=9295)|
| 2:34:56| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=9296)|
| 2:34:57| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=9297)|
| 2:34:58| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=9298)|
| 2:35:00| You guys have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=9300)|
| 2:35:02| I believe it was some weak eyes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=9302)|
| 2:35:06| Resolution 919 is to authorize certain current and former county judges| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=9306)|
| 2:35:11| and county officials of Knox County to establish prior service credit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=9311)|
| 2:35:15| in the Tennessee Consolidated Retirement System pursuant to TCA Section 8-35-116B2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=9315)|
| 2:35:25| Finance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=9325)|
| 2:35:27| Recommendation 10-0.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=9327)|
| 2:35:30| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=9330)|
| 2:35:32| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=9332)|
| 2:35:33| Is someone here from the pension plan, pension board?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=9333)|
| 2:35:36| Yes, we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=9336)|
| 2:35:39| Mr. Baylor is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=9339)|
| 2:35:44| I'm looking at the numbers here, Mr. Baylor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=9344)|
| 2:35:47| and it says that we did an actuarial study to convert to this plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=9347)|
| 2:35:54| and the results of the study says that Knox County would owe $1,098,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=9354)|
| 2:36:01| or if we amortize it over a 20-year period, it would be $8,659 per month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=9361)|
| 2:36:08| I just saw this when it came in our packet over the weekend,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=9368)|
| 2:36:11| so I guess I'm just kind of wanting explanation of what's going on because I don't get it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=9371)|
| 2:36:17| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=9377)|
| 2:36:19| Disclaimer up front, this is not an activity or project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=9379)|
| 2:36:24| or proposal brought to you by the Knox County Pension Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=9384)|
| 2:36:29| This is an issue that was raised by some elected officials of Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=9389)|
| 2:36:36| as to the possibility of their participation in TCRS| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=9396)|
| 2:36:39| as an alternative to continued participation in the Knox County retirement system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=9399)|
| 2:36:45| So our position all along has been that's between the individual participant and TCRS,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=9405)|
| 2:36:54| and as to funding, that's got to come back to this commission for funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=9414)|
| 2:36:59| The numbers you're looking at, those were developed by the consultants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=9419)|
| 2:37:05| who were retained to prepare their report, and those numbers, we don't certify those numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=9425)|
| 2:37:13| Those are the consultant and TCRS numbers, not the Knox County pension system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=9433)|
| 2:37:19| Our position is if this commission chooses to fund it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=9439)|
| 2:37:23| and those participants choose to enroll in TCRS| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=9443)|
| 2:37:27| and TCRS determines that they are eligible,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=9447)|
| 2:37:31| then that's none of the Knox County pension system's business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=9451)|
| 2:37:37| Again, just having got, thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=9457)|
| 2:37:40| Having just got, I'm not prepared to vote on this today because, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=9460)|
| 2:37:43| I don't really understand everything that's going on with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=9463)|
| 2:37:45| All I see is that we're going to add another million dollars to our budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=9465)|
| 2:37:49| and if we amortize it over 20 years, it's going to be more than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=9469)|
| 2:37:53| So I guess I would make a recommendation or make a motion that we defer this for 30 days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=9473)|
| 2:37:58| and let's bring in some folks to answer some questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=9478)|
| 2:38:00| and let's find out more about exactly what we're talking about here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=9480)|
| 2:38:04| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=9484)|
| 2:38:06| We have a substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=9486)|
| 2:38:08| Commissioner Pinkston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=9488)|
| 2:38:10| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=9490)|
| 2:38:12| Are these judges going to pay anything into this fund?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=9492)|
| 2:38:16| Well, all of those participants, it presumes a forfeiture of their accounts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=9496)|
| 2:38:21| with the Knox County system into the TCRS.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=9501)|
| 2:38:24| So in that respect, yes, they would be paying, they would be transferring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=9504)|
| 2:38:30| Now the county pension fund into this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=9510)|
| 2:38:32| Yes, sir, into TCRS plus the additional funding that I don't,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=9512)|
| 2:38:36| I'm sorry I don't recall the numbers off the top of my head,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=9516)|
| 2:38:39| but which Commissioner Hammond was referring to earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=9519)|
| 2:38:42| Well, right now I'd have to vote against it, so I'll go along with the deferral for 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=9522)|
| 2:38:48| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=9528)|
| 2:38:52| Commissioner Daniels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=9532)|
| 2:38:54| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=9534)|
| 2:38:55| If we're going to go ahead and vote to defer, that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=9535)|
| 2:38:57| Motion, the substitute motion on the floor is to defer for 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=9537)|
| 2:39:00| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=9540)|
| 2:39:01| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=9541)|
| 2:39:02| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=9542)|
| 2:39:03| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=9543)|

| 2:39:17| We're on page 28.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=9557)|
| 2:39:19| Ordinance on first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=9559)|

| 2:39:40| Commissioner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=9580)|
| 2:39:41| Make a motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=9581)|
| 2:39:43| Commissioner Hammond has, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=9583)|
| 2:39:44| Oh, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=9584)|
| 2:39:45| No, I mean, you can go ahead and make a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=9585)|
| 2:39:46| I've just got a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=9586)|
| 2:39:47| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=9587)|
| 2:39:49| Commissioner Davis and the law director, as I read this, basically the only change we're looking at is the people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=9589)|
| 2:39:56| part of them would come from the mayor, part would come from commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=9596)|
| 2:39:59| But the body then would submit its report to the election commission if they had a report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=9599)|
| 2:40:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=9603)|
| 2:40:04| Now, this only deals with the selection of the review committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=9604)|
| 2:40:09| This does not deal with their work product.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=9609)|
| 2:40:12| This is just.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=9612)|
| 2:40:14| This is the one part of what came before the body, what, last month?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=9614)|
| 2:40:20| Well, every month since about March.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=9620)|
| 2:40:23| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=9623)|
| 2:40:24| And this is just splitting it in two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=9624)|
| 2:40:26| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=9626)|
| 2:40:27| So if we approve this, it has to be on second reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=9627)|
| 2:40:30| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=9630)|
| 2:40:31| And if we put it on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=9631)|
| 2:40:32| So I would need someone from this body that is going to be here next month to also sponsor this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=9632)|
| 2:40:39| But would we.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=9639)|
| 2:40:40| So that it could be on second reading next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=9640)|
| 2:40:42| I guess either Mr. McKay or Mr. Owings, would we have time to get it on the ballot if it's on the agenda for September the 20,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=9642)|
| 2:40:51| whatever it is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=9651)|
| 2:40:53| Is that over the time limit to get this on the ballot if it's approved on second reading at the September meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=9653)|
| 2:41:01| I'm thinking it would be too late.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=9661)|
| 2:41:03| So we would be looking at putting it on the ballot at the next general election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=9663)|
| 2:41:10| I think the deadline for getting things on the ballot is September 5th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=9670)|
| 2:41:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=9673)|
| 2:41:14| Days before the election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=9674)|
| 2:41:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=9675)|
| 2:41:17| I mean, that would be up to this body if they wanted to have another special called meeting or, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=9677)|
| 2:41:22| when you meet on the 29th to have a public forum after it to satisfy those public forums.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=9682)|
| 2:41:29| And, you know, that would be up to your discretion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=9689)|
| 2:41:33| You'd have to have your two public hearings and then your second reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=9693)|
| 2:41:36| I'm going to vote in favor of it because I'm going to send you out on a high note.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=9696)|
| 2:41:39| So I'm in favor of first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=9699)|
| 2:41:40| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=9700)|
| 2:41:41| So we'd have to have two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=9701)|
| 2:41:43| But I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=9703)|
| 2:41:44| But I need somebody to also sponsor it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=9704)|
| 2:41:47| So I'd hope that they would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=9707)|
| 2:41:49| So there would need to be two public forums before September the when?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=9709)|
| 2:41:54| The 5th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=9714)|
| 2:41:55| And a call meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=9715)|
| 2:41:59| You can have them after the 29th and whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=9719)|
| 2:42:03| Well, if it's going to be on the 20th, well, yeah, I guess we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=9723)|
| 2:42:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=9727)|
| 2:42:11| Yeah, you're not going to be able to get it to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=9731)|
| 2:42:14| And when we have the public, well, I don't even know if I'll be chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=9734)|
| 2:42:19| I'd like to have 100% participation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=9739)|
| 2:42:26| We can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=9746)|
| 2:42:27| That's a great idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=9747)|
| 2:42:28| Victoria brought her pajamas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=9748)|
| 2:42:29| I'd like to have 100% participation at the public meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=9749)|
| 2:42:34| There are two people, three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=9754)|
| 2:42:38| I know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=9758)|
| 2:42:41| I don't want to set that precedent, but we can do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=9761)|
| 2:42:45| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=9765)|
| 2:42:48| Oh, Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=9768)|
| 2:42:51| I guess I just want to put out there to be clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=9771)|
| 2:42:55| What this is asking, this is asking for a change in the process that gives| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=9775)|
| 2:43:02| the county commission an opportunity to thumbs up or thumbs down each particular member.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=9782)|
| 2:43:10| Is that what you're trying to do, Commissioner Davis?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=9790)|
| 2:43:12| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=9792)|
| 2:43:13| I just felt like it was more in line of the selection process with regard to the ethics committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=9793)|
| 2:43:20| because that's how they select those members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=9800)|
| 2:43:22| And I felt like that in voting for a block of, you know, potentially 28 people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=9802)|
| 2:43:29| there may be one person on that committee that you feel has a conflict,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=9809)|
| 2:43:33| and therefore you would vote the whole committee down instead of not having the opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=9813)|
| 2:43:39| just to vote that one individual that may have a conflict or that may have a perceived conflict.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=9819)|
| 2:43:44| So it gives you that flexibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=9824)|
| 2:43:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=9826)|
| 2:43:47| You know, the way I see it in simple terms,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=9827)|
| 2:43:52| and that's that the public has a process that they can go through to get things on the ballot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=9832)|
| 2:44:00| County commission has a fairly simple process that we can go through to get things on the ballot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=9840)|
| 2:44:08| And the mayor has a process that he can go through to get things on the ballot with our approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=9848)|
| 2:44:15| I think we're looking at today, and that's unfortunate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=9855)|
| 2:44:20| I think that if we approve this, we will be giving an unfair weight to this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=9860)|
| 2:44:26| We would essentially have two mechanisms that we can go through,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=9866)|
| 2:44:31| or that we can block that third branch from getting things put on the ballot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=9871)|
| 2:44:40| So that's why I hate this last minute, but that's why I'm going to have to be against this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=9880)|
| 2:44:46| Well, I just respectfully disagree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=9886)|
| 2:44:49| I don't think that commission is actually controlling the work product.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=9889)|
| 2:44:53| And that seemed to be the concern last time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=9893)|
| 2:44:56| Everybody seemed to be in agreement with regard to the selection of individuals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=9896)|
| 2:45:00| And if you have a mayor that heavily weights the body, he can control, actually, what is put into our charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=9900)|
| 2:45:08| And that, to me, is a real concern that you would have the mayor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=9908)|
| 2:45:13| and 28 individuals decide what's going to happen for this county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=9913)|
| 2:45:19| But, again, I said, you know, you're going to have county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=9919)|
| 2:45:23| A part of the mayor's process has commissioners on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=9923)|
| 2:45:28| And then after they vet and do whatever they need to do to come out with an end product, well, to even get there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=9928)|
| 2:45:36| we have to vote on those people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=9936)|
| 2:45:40| So the mayor has to put roughly half of his body on the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=9940)|
| 2:45:48| And then also, at the end, we'll get to vote on the end product.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=9948)|
| 2:45:53| So it's just, again, I'm just looking for balance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=9953)|
| 2:45:58| You don't get a vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=9958)|
| 2:46:02| That's true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=9962)|
| 2:46:03| I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=9963)|
| 2:46:04| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=9964)|
| 2:46:05| We do not get a vote on the end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=9965)|
| 2:46:07| So I guess what I'm saying is if we don't like or if we know this group of five is for, you know, painting the streets black and gold,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=9967)|
| 2:46:20| we can vote those five individuals down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=9980)|
| 2:46:24| Well, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=9984)|
| 2:46:25| Maybe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=9985)|
| 2:46:26| I didn't want to say purple and gold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=9986)|
| 2:46:27| I get some people upset.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=9987)|
| 2:46:28| Well, I would hope that you would put individuals on that were objective and that weren't biased,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=9988)|
| 2:46:32| that you wouldn't have people included in that committee that had already made up their mind one way or another.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=9992)|
| 2:46:38| But I think that's what you're saying, that the mayor could do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=9998)|
| 2:46:42| And, again, I'll cut off the debate here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=10002)|
| 2:46:44| Yeah, I'm going to cut it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=10004)|
| 2:46:46| But we have a motion on the floor to accept.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=10006)|
| 2:46:49| And with second, and I know we're going to have to have a roll call vote, so which way do we go last?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=10009)|
| 2:46:58| We can go in the first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=10018)|
| 2:47:02| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=10022)|
| 2:47:03| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=10023)|
| 2:47:05| Commissioner Strickland.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=10025)|
| 2:47:06| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=10026)|
| 2:47:07| Commissioner Mark Harmon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=10027)|
| 2:47:09| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=10029)|
| 2:47:11| Commissioner Campin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=10031)|
| 2:47:12| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=10032)|
| 2:47:13| Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=10033)|
| 2:47:14| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=10034)|
| 2:47:15| Commissioner Oven Harman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=10035)|
| 2:47:17| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=10037)|
| 2:47:18| Commissioner Davis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=10038)|
| 2:47:20| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=10040)|
| 2:47:21| Commissioner Daniels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=10041)|

| 2:47:23| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=10043)|
| 2:47:24| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=10044)|

| 2:47:37| I'll be doing things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=10057)|
| 2:47:40| Where is he?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=10060)|
| 2:47:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=10064)|
| 2:47:45| Smith is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=10065)|
| 2:47:46| Smith was yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=10066)|
| 2:47:47| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=10067)|

| 2:47:49| Commissioner Moore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=10069)|

| 2:48:22| Mr. McKay, let me get some clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=10102)|
| 2:48:24| Now, we have to have two public hearings and another vote before September the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=10104)|
| 2:48:31| when?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=10111)|
| 2:48:38| To be added.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=10118)|
| 2:48:39| Fifth, September 5th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=10119)|
| 2:48:40| Anything that the Commission does has to be at our office to go on a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=10120)|
| 2:48:43| November ballot by September 5th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=10123)|
| 2:48:45| It's 60 days before the election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=10125)|
| 2:48:47| Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=10127)|
| 2:48:48| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=10128)|
| 2:48:49| I would like to add that this be heard after our special called meeting on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=10129)|
| 2:48:56| the 29th to be as the first or at least one of the public hearings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=10136)|
| 2:49:03| I don't know if we need to add that as part of our special meeting or is it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=10143)|
| 2:49:05| to be an additional special meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=10145)|
| 2:49:07| It will be an additional meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=10147)|
| 2:49:12| Any other way, the first one will be Mayor Ragsdale's meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=10152)|
| 2:49:17| So this will be an additional.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=10157)|
| 2:49:18| Go back to him to get a letter to tell me to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=10158)|
| 2:49:21| No, we'll just do this as an additional.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=10161)|
| 2:49:23| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=10163)|
| 2:49:26| Is that agreeable with everyone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=10166)|
| 2:49:28| But is that going to happen on Friday or not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=10168)|
| 2:49:30| Happen on Friday?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=10170)|
| 2:49:33| Well, you know, I think it's a whole lot to ask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=10173)|
| 2:49:37| We have one of the remaining folks, I guess, of the three or four that's here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=10177)|
| 2:49:45| tonight to have them come in and be sworn in at 9 o'clock and at 1030,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=10185)|
| 2:49:50| 11 o'clock, they're voting on really substantial issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=10190)|
| 2:49:57| All we're doing is hearing from the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=10197)|
| 2:49:59| It's just a public hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=10199)|
| 2:50:00| They won't be taking a vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=10200)|
| 2:50:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=10205)|
| 2:50:06| So we'll have the two public hearings and then we will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=10206)|
| 2:50:08| Well, the first one, if everybody's agreeable, will be August the 29th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=10208)|
| 2:50:14| There are no objections, so everybody be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=10214)|
| 2:50:18| Do you have a suggestion for the next one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=10218)|
| 2:50:23| Well, it has to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=10223)|
| 2:50:24| What day of the week does the fifth fall on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=10224)|
| 2:50:26| I don't have a calendar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=10226)|
| 2:50:27| What day is September 5th?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=10227)|
| 2:50:30| And we'd have to have that prior to the fifth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=10230)|
| 2:50:33| We couldn't have a public hearing and then turn around and vote in a different hearing on the same day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=10233)|
| 2:50:37| or would we have to do it on a day prior to the day that we vote on it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=10237)|
| 2:50:42| We can have a public hearing and then do it right after a public hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=10242)|
| 2:50:49| Have a public hearing on the fifth and then a special called meeting to vote on it immediately following that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=10249)|
| 2:50:56| I say we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=10256)|
| 2:50:57| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=10257)|
| 2:50:59| Then I say we do it on the fifth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=10259)|
| 2:51:02| We've got until 4.30, Greg, or is it 12 o'clock or what hour of the day on the fifth?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=10262)|
| 2:51:19| I would think it would be 4.30.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=10279)|
| 2:51:22| I think it would be 12.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=10282)|
| 2:51:24| Do you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=10284)|
| 2:51:26| I think it would be 4.30.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=10286)|
| 2:51:27| Oh, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=10287)|
| 2:51:28| Well, let's do it in the morning anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=10288)|
| 2:51:30| Let's do it like at 9 o'clock and get it over with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=10290)|
| 2:51:33| 9 o'clock for the public hearing and then immediately following we'd have the special meeting to vote on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=10293)|
| 2:51:39| Is everybody, everyone agreeable?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=10299)|
| 2:51:42| September 5th at 9 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=10302)|
| 2:51:46| I'm sure the ones leaving are agreeable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=10306)|
| 2:51:50| No problem, huh?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=10310)|
| 2:51:51| Yeah, no problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=10311)|
| 2:51:53| Make it 7 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=10313)|
| 2:51:55| Commissioner Daniels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=10315)|
| 2:51:56| Is that agreeable?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=10316)|
| 2:51:57| Commissioner Daniels also wishes to put his name on this ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=10317)|
| 2:52:01| I was on it originally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=10321)|
| 2:52:06| There will be a public hearing on the 29th and September 5th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=10326)|
| 2:52:10| and then we'll have another special call meeting on the September 5th at 9 o'clock,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=10330)|
| 2:52:16| well, right after the public hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=10336)|
| 2:52:23| I think Jody will send a notice out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=10343)|
| 2:52:29| And just to be clear, this will need a two-thirds vote after that on second reading?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=10349)|
| 2:52:34| Two-thirds vote on both readings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=10354)|
| 2:52:39| Mary Ann just reminded me, and it's something that you'll need to keep in mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=10359)|
| 2:52:45| After your second hearing, once you've had the meeting, if you approve it on second reading,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=10365)|
| 2:52:52| then the question has to be certified to the election commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=10372)|
| 2:52:56| The mayor will have to sign it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=10376)|
| 2:52:58| It will have to be signed off on by George Duxbury and it has to be signed off by the county clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=10378)|
| 2:53:05| How about that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=10385)|
| 2:53:06| And then it will have to get to the election commission on time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=10386)|
| 2:53:12| It's going to be a time different than 430, Greg.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=10392)|
| 2:53:15| Let us know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=10395)|
| 2:53:17| Let the chairman know before that meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=10397)|
| 2:53:23| Okay, who's next?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=10403)|
| 2:53:26| Your office will have to prepare the resolution also on the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=10406)|
| 2:53:32| Not me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=10412)|

| 2:53:52| Nine amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=10432)|
| 2:53:54| This is an ordinance to establish a two-term limit on members appointed to boards, commissions, and authorities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=10434)|
| 2:54:04| Part 2, Chapter 2, Article 1, Section 2 through 5, previously reserved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=10444)|
| 2:54:11| Any governmental?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=10451)|
| 2:54:13| Voted 9-0 to change it to an ordinance instead of an amendment to the charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=10453)|
| 2:54:18| Finance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=10458)|

| 2:54:31| Public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=10471)|
| 2:54:32| We have two people on public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=10472)|
| 2:54:34| Whoa, whoa, whoa.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=10474)|
| 2:54:35| Well, we got some more of these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=10475)|
| 2:54:36| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=10476)|
| 2:54:45| That would have to be it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=10485)|
| 2:54:46| That last one would be an ordinance on first reading, would it not, since it's the second reading of?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=10486)|
| 2:54:51| Well, it was supposed to be second reading, but, Mr. Law Director,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=10491)|
| 2:54:54| Would that be a substantial change, changing it from an ordinance from a charter amendment ordinance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=10494)|
| 2:55:01| Well, it had already gone through one vetting, and so this would be, it's still an ordinance, second reading, same language.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=10501)|
| 2:55:10| Basically, we've.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=10510)|
| 2:55:11| Just took out the charter?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=10511)|
| 2:55:13| We took out the charter issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=10513)|
| 2:55:15| We put it within the Knox County Code, and I would, I believe that's sufficient for a second reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=10515)|
| 2:55:20| You don't believe that's a substantial change?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=10520)|
| 2:55:22| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=10522)|
| 2:55:23| If you don't believe that, then that's fine with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=10523)|
| 2:55:24| I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=10524)|
| 2:55:27| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=10527)|
| 2:55:35| Everyone said no, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=10535)|
| 2:55:36| What else do we have?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=10536)|
| 2:55:42| We've got the charter amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=10542)|
| 2:55:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=10545)|
| 2:55:47| We don't have any.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=10547)|
| 2:55:48| Do we have anything on it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=10548)|
| 2:55:50| We didn't vote on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=10550)|
| 2:55:52| I thought you were talking about do we have any.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=10552)|
| 2:55:53| Yeah, we did, and it passed to get on this agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=10553)|
| 2:55:57| Is that the only thing we have left?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=10557)|
| 2:56:00| The only?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=10560)|
| 2:56:01| I thought it took two-thirds and we didn't vote on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=10561)|
| 2:56:03| Well, we haven't, we haven't even addressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=10563)|
| 2:56:05| Yeah, we voted to add it to the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=10565)|
| 2:56:07| We voted to add it to the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=10567)|
| 2:56:08| It's added.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=10568)|
| 2:56:12| Go ahead, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=10572)|
| 2:56:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=10574)|
| 2:56:15| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=10575)|
| 2:56:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=10576)|
| 2:56:18| My motion, and I appreciate the commission indulging the two-thirds vote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=10578)|
| 2:56:24| and it was for us to reconsider placing the charter amendments on the ballot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=10584)|
| 2:56:28| given the fact that the petitioners are successful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=10588)|
| 2:56:34| They're going to far exceed the number of signatures that they need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=10594)|
| 2:56:39| They've studied this statistically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=10599)|
| 2:56:42| or the validation rate at which signatures will be approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=10602)|
| 2:56:48| And so really what it boils down to is the county is going to have to pay this $80,000 bill to verify the signatures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=10608)|
| 2:56:58| And so regardless, in my view and in the view of several,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=10618)|
| 2:57:05| it's not really a question of whether any item on the petition is helpful to the county or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=10625)|
| 2:57:11| It's the petitioners are successful,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=10631)|
| 2:57:13| and now it's a question of whether we want to spend the money to have to validate these signatures| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=10633)|
| 2:57:20| when we know, in fact, they're going to be validated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=10640)|
| 2:57:25| So I would like to make the motion that we have a special call meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=10645)|
| 2:57:34| where we add to the agenda on August 29th that this item be taken up by the new commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=10654)|
| 2:57:45| and be determined as to whether we're going to add it to the ballot or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=10665)|
| 2:57:51| And that's my motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=10671)|
| 2:57:54| Do we have a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=10674)|
| 2:57:55| I'll second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=10675)|
| 2:57:57| All the likes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=10677)|
| 2:58:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=10680)|
| 2:58:01| Commissioner Moore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=10681)|
| 2:58:05| I've talked to some people in my community, which I represent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=10685)|
| 2:58:09| and I told them that I would support this if it came back up on three conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=10689)|
| 2:58:15| And the conditions were that we would add to elect a school superintendent to the ballot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=10695)|
| 2:58:24| also add to see if Knox County wanted to continue under a charter form of government| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=10704)|
| 2:58:30| or go back under state law, as 93 other counties do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=10710)|
| 2:58:35| And the third question is any tax increase over 3% cost of living would go to the voters| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=10715)|
| 2:58:42| to have to be approved by Knox County voters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=10722)|
| 2:58:46| So if those three can get added, I would support the rest of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=10726)|
| 2:58:50| If not, I take my stance as I did before and vote no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=10730)|
| 2:58:55| Let's put on the ballot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=10735)|
| 2:58:56| Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=10736)|
| 2:58:58| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=10738)|
| 2:59:02| I'm going to try to be nice, and, Tony, I'm not picking on you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=10742)|
| 2:59:05| but you say you know for a fact that they've got the signatures| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=10745)|
| 2:59:13| and that those signatures are going to be good,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=10753)|
| 2:59:15| and I would challenge you that unless you have some psychic abilities that I'm not familiar with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=10755)|
| 2:59:20| then you don't know for a fact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=10760)|
| 2:59:23| You strongly suspect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=10763)|
| 2:59:25| But to make the statement that you know for a fact is a bit misleading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=10765)|
| 2:59:30| I said it was a virtual certainty, and I don't think that's misleading at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=10770)|
| 2:59:35| I disagree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=10775)|
| 2:59:36| I don't think it's a certainty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=10776)|
| 2:59:38| I think that they're getting some signatures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=10778)|
| 2:59:41| I've worked a petition drive before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=10781)|
| 2:59:44| One that we actually did and didn't have paid professionals doing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=10784)|
| 2:59:49| so we actually had folks that believed in the cause.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=10789)|
| 2:59:54| Folks sign petitions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=10794)|
| 2:59:57| A lot of people will sign anything you put in front of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=10797)|
| 3:00:00| They'll sign names other than their own name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=10800)|
| 3:00:05| They'll sign their neighbor's name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=10805)|
| 3:00:06| They just want to, you know, avoid the confrontation of the petitioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=10806)|
| 3:00:11| Also, this petition group, their reports,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=10811)|
| 3:00:16| and I've heard recordings of folks where they were misled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=10816)|
| 3:00:21| They were told that these charter amendments would do things that they absolutely will not do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=10821)|
| 3:00:27| They were told it was about one thing when it was actually about a dozen things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=10827)|
| 3:00:32| and there's a lot of folks out there that feel like they were misled into signing this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=10832)|
| 3:00:38| So I think what you're probably going to see in the very near future| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=10838)|
| 3:00:41| is you're going to see counter-petition folks with letters out on the street for folks to sign saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=10841)|
| 3:00:48| you know, if I sign this, I signed it mistakenly, I don't agree with it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=10848)|
| 3:00:53| and I'd like my name taken off of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=10853)|
| 3:00:56| And I think that under the circumstances,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=10856)|
| 3:01:00| it's not guaranteed that they're going to get their signatures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=10860)|
| 3:01:04| In fact, I kind of doubt they will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=10864)|
| 3:01:06| They may.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=10866)|
| 3:01:07| But, you know, what's going to have to happen is they're going to have to count the petitions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=10867)|
| 3:01:12| and then they're going to have to take into account all of the letters that people are going to turn in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=10872)|
| 3:01:18| saying they want their name removed from it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=10878)|
| 3:01:21| And I think at the end of the day, it's going to be pretty close,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=10881)|
| 3:01:24| and I think they're probably going to fail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=10884)|
| 3:01:28| I also feel like that this commission has heard this time and time and time again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=10888)|
| 3:01:37| Several different renditions, or two different renditions, I think the nine-member commission heard this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=10897)|
| 3:01:43| and now this current commission has heard this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=10903)|
| 3:01:47| This has been heard over and over and over again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=10907)|
| 3:01:51| and I really think that we in Knox County have got to stop this stuff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=10911)|
| 3:01:55| of if we don't get our way on a vote, we come back and do it again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=10915)|
| 3:02:01| I think that we need to accept the fact that sometimes we lose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=10921)|
| 3:02:05| And I understand, Mr. Norman, that you're passionate about this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=10925)|
| 3:02:08| and I understand you believe in these amendments, and I respect you for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=10928)|
| 3:02:13| You know, we have a difference of opinion on some of these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=10933)|
| 3:02:16| But to come back, if I went back and took every time I had lost a vote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=10936)|
| 3:02:22| we could have had Tyler Harbor on the agenda time and time again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=10942)|
| 3:02:27| But after I lost my vote, I accepted that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=10947)|
| 3:02:31| And I think that we need to start accepting when a vote doesn't go our way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=10951)|
| 3:02:36| and quit continuously bringing them back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=10956)|
| 3:02:38| That's why I'm not going to support this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=10958)|
| 3:02:40| I do not want to reward the bad behavior of line to petition signers to get them to sign stuff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=10960)|
| 3:02:48| so they'll get their $1.50 or whatever they're paid per signature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=10968)|
| 3:02:52| And I also think that we as a body, and we're about to reconvene with a new set of folks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=10972)|
| 3:02:58| that we need to start accepting the fact that sometimes we've lost| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=10978)|
| 3:03:02| and quit continuously bringing stuff up and rehashing it over and over and over again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=10982)|
| 3:03:08| We're not five years old.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=10988)|
| 3:03:10| We are adults and we need to act like it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=10990)|
| 3:03:12| Okay, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=10992)|
| 3:03:14| Commissioner Daniels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=10994)|
| 3:03:16| Greg, let me ask you a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=10996)|
| 3:03:20| I've heard it mentioned several times through the media that they believe the petition group has said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=11000)|
| 3:03:29| that there's a certain level of reliability on these signatures, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=11009)|
| 3:03:34| And you may have even made a comment to the fact that 80% of them or something are qualified signatures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=11014)|
| 3:03:42| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=11022)|
| 3:03:43| Well, I'm not sure if you're asking me to speak about what they've said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=11023)|
| 3:03:49| I can tell you that I've told them and I've told everybody that we have done two of these petitions now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=11029)|
| 3:03:54| since I got there five years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=11034)|
| 3:03:56| And they both average about 20% drop rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=11036)|
| 3:04:00| Okay, so we haven't done any preliminary review of signatures and or?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=11040)|
| 3:04:06| I haven't seen any.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=11046)|
| 3:04:07| Okay, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=11047)|
| 3:04:09| So the fact that the numbers are coming up with is based upon prior petitions only, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=11049)|
| 3:04:17| Yeah, particularly the wheel tax one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=11057)|
| 3:04:18| I think they ran about 20% invalid, usually the signature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=11058)|
| 3:04:22| If you have moved and failed to tell the election commission to change your voter registration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=11062)|
| 3:04:27| and then you write down your new address on the petition, we don't count that as a signature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=11067)|
| 3:04:31| It has to have the address that we have on file by state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=11071)|
| 3:04:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=11075)|
| 3:04:36| I'm pretty specific about what you can do and what you can't do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=11076)|
| 3:04:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=11079)|
| 3:04:41| I've got two concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=11081)|
| 3:04:42| One is that I was told last week that there is going to be a lawsuit filed over the misrepresentation by some of the folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=11082)|
| 3:04:51| I think most of us have seen or heard the tapes of, you know, folks being misled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=11091)|
| 3:04:58| Of course, you know, I spoke with you about it the other day as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=11098)|
| 3:05:03| My daughter and I came out of a Kroger the other day and had someone approach me and ask me if I was a voter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=11103)|
| 3:05:09| And I told them I was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=11109)|
| 3:05:12| And they began to talk about that if I wanted to run the mayor out of office, all I had to do was sign this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=11112)|
| 3:05:20| Proceeded to explain that these would be on the ballot if it wasn't for the stupid commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=11120)|
| 3:05:24| And I said, I totally understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=11124)|
| 3:05:26| I'm one of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=11126)|
| 3:05:28| Which, of course, the person turned ashen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=11128)|
| 3:05:32| But, you know, I think the thing of it is, you know, the public needs to know the truth about what they're voting on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=11132)|
| 3:05:41| And when I asked the gentleman why wouldn't he tell everything that was on each one of those, he said, well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=11141)|
| 3:05:47| it takes too long and I'm not getting paid to tell 20 minutes' worth of information to these folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=11147)|
| 3:05:54| My job is to get them to sign it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=11154)|
| 3:05:56| And to me, you know, that's just, that isn't what this is about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=11156)|
| 3:06:01| It's about people being informed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=11161)|
| 3:06:06| The last time I voted for all nine of these to be placed on the ballot because I was afraid of this very type of thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=11166)|
| 3:06:13| misrepresentation, folks not hearing the whole truth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=11173)|
| 3:06:17| This time I will vote against it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=11177)|
| 3:06:20| Thank you, Greg.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=11180)|
| 3:06:23| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=11183)|
| 3:06:25| Yes, thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=11185)|
| 3:06:27| that we would need to follow should this pass because even though we've had public hearings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=11187)|
| 3:06:32| even though the law director has looked at it before, we're basically looking now at starting over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=11192)|
| 3:06:38| Just like your, Commissioner Davis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=11198)|
| 3:06:40| So, Mr. Law Director, would you go over the procedure that we would need to follow?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=11200)|
| 3:06:44| And we did these procedures for a reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=11204)|
| 3:06:47| We wanted to make sure that the law director had an opportunity to look at them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=11207)|
| 3:06:50| We wanted to make sure that the public had adequate opportunity to provide input before they go on the ballot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=11210)|
| 3:06:55| So, would you tell us what we're going to need to do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=11215)|
| 3:06:58| Very quickly, you would have to have a meeting to approve them on first reading with a two-thirds vote of the body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=11218)|
| 3:07:06| You would have to have a couple of hearings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=11226)|
| 3:07:08| Your law director would have to review them to bring back any changes or recommendations that he might lend to the body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=11228)|
| 3:07:21| Another vetting of the charter amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=11241)|
| 3:07:25| A second reading with a two-thirds vote of the body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=11245)|
| 3:07:30| And to get that certified and get it very quickly over to the election commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=11250)|
| 3:07:35| And this would have to be done by September 5th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=11255)|
| 3:07:37| This by September 5th also?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=11257)|
| 3:07:39| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=11259)|
| 3:07:43| Well, that's why I wanted to make sure we understand the procedure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=11263)|
| 3:07:45| I mean, there's no question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=11265)|
| 3:07:48| It's going to surprise anybody to know that I was in favor of putting these on the ballot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=11268)|
| 3:07:51| Still am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=11271)|
| 3:07:53| And these folks have gone out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=11273)|
| 3:07:54| They've gotten their petitions and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=11274)|
| 3:07:56| When you look at what happened in the last election, the two charter amendments that were on there passed by an overwhelming margin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=11276)|
| 3:08:01| I think most of these, not all, I do think most of these would pass if they were on individually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=11281)|
| 3:08:06| But anyway, I just wanted to point out what the procedure would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=11286)|
| 3:08:10| Commissioner Davis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=11290)|
| 3:08:13| Yes, I just wanted to, I guess, witness to the fact that I had a petition gather outside of Kroger,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=11293)|
| 3:08:22| and he proceeded to tell me that the white petition was for the inspector general| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=11302)|
| 3:08:27| and that we needed an inspector general to audit commission, that commission was not spending its dollars wisely,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=11307)|
| 3:08:33| and so we needed to be audited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=11313)|
| 3:08:35| And then the orange petition was for nepotism, and that's the only thing that they were for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=11315)|
| 3:08:41| And this was a paid volunteer, and I asked repeatedly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=11321)|
| 3:08:45| We actually read some of the items together, and I said, What does this mean?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=11325)|
| 3:08:49| He said, I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=11329)|
| 3:08:51| And I had, over the weekend, on one of the television news programs, one of the steering committee members, Mr. Tulloch,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=11331)|
| 3:09:00| had said that they even have a sheet that they can review and go over with folks if they have any sort of questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=11340)|
| 3:09:08| And that person did not have any sort of material for him to review or to answer any of the questions that I had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=11348)|
| 3:09:15| And my concern is that you have people that the only conversation that they will have known about these amendments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=11355)|
| 3:09:23| will have been with that petition gatherer, that signature person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=11363)|
| 3:09:27| And that's the only thing that they'll, the only knowledge that they'll have when they go into the voting booth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=11367)|
| 3:09:33| And that's a real concern for me when we're talking about making structural changes to our government| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=11373)|
| 3:09:39| that are really huge structural changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=11379)|
| 3:09:42| And so I think that there needs to be a very clear and definitive education process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=11382)|
| 3:09:49| to make sure that people understand what they're voting for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=11389)|
| 3:09:53| And when you have a group calling themselves Knox Accountability,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=11393)|
| 3:09:57| they need to make sure that they're accountable for the signature gatherers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=11397)|
| 3:10:01| that they are educating people when they're gathering those signatures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=11401)|
| 3:10:05| I'd also like to state that Elaine and I were not at the Kroger together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=11405)|
| 3:10:11| Yeah, you were.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=11411)|
| 3:10:12| Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=11412)|
| 3:10:14| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=11414)|
| 3:10:17| I want to respond to a couple of things, not to get in a fracas with Mr. Lambert, because that would be meaningless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=11417)|
| 3:10:27| This has nothing to do with losing a vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=11427)|
| 3:10:30| I don't feel like I've lost any vote whatsoever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=11430)|
| 3:10:33| I feel like it's our obligation, given the last two years of what this commission has gone through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=11433)|
| 3:10:39| and Knox County has gone through, is to do everything we can to do whatever we can to try to instill trust in government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=11439)|
| 3:10:49| And to also express whenever we can an example of good stewardship.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=11449)|
| 3:10:55| And I think this is just a simple matter of a needless, wasteful expense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=11455)|
| 3:11:01| Now, Mr. Lambert would have us believe, based on his expert opinion about petitions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=11461)|
| 3:11:08| and his experience with petitions, that all types of anecdotal evidence that he's gathered in the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=11468)|
| 3:11:14| would lead him to believe that this is not going to pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=11474)|
| 3:11:18| Well, there's a whole lot of people that invested a whole lot of time and money into this effort,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=11478)|
| 3:11:24| and they believe that they're going to have $5,000 in excess of what they need in terms of signatures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=11484)|
| 3:11:31| That means we're going to pay a whole bunch of money for nothing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=11491)|
| 3:11:34| So this is what it's about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=11494)|
| 3:11:37| And I understand this is a hard row to hoe, especially when you've got to go two-thirds on the first meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=11497)|
| 3:11:44| the first special called meeting, two-thirds again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=11504)|
| 3:11:47| I don't think there's much of a vetting process because these have been vetted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=11507)|
| 3:11:53| And I think the wording, as they exist right now, are going to stand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=11513)|
| 3:11:58| And I hope we don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=11518)|
| 3:11:59| That's not my intent, to get into any of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=11519)|
| 3:12:02| My intent is simply to say that people need to vote on these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=11522)|
| 3:12:07| It will be a way that the commission says, we believe in democracy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=11527)|
| 3:12:15| We believe this is part of the democratic process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=11535)|
| 3:12:18| And it's good for Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=11538)|
| 3:12:20| And that's all that I'm trying to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=11540)|
| 3:12:23| Tony, question of Princeton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=11543)|
| 3:12:25| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=11545)|
| 3:12:26| I've got several questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=11546)|
| 3:12:28| Ms. Davis, on the petitions that you saw, did they have anything on them except a place for you to sign?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=11548)|
| 3:12:36| He had the first, he had it where you'd sign it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=11556)|
| 3:12:41| And then, actually, I made him lift it up and look at the other side where it had the actual petition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=11561)|
| 3:12:47| And we read word for word one of the sections with regard to the mayor appointing all the fee offices| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=11567)|
| 3:12:54| and losing that vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=11574)|
| 3:12:56| And I asked him specifically, what does that mean?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=11576)|
| 3:12:59| And we read it together out loud.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=11579)|
| 3:13:01| And he said, I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=11581)|
| 3:13:03| Well, the reason why I'm asking you that, the ones I saw were just blank,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=11583)|
| 3:13:06| just places for your signatures, didn't have anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=11586)|
| 3:13:08| Well, I asked him if he had something that I could take home with me to read, and they did not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=11588)|
| 3:13:12| He just referred me to the website.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=11592)|
| 3:13:14| So if you don't have a computer, you didn't have a way to even really read the words.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=11594)|
| 3:13:21| Greg?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=11601)|
| 3:13:24| You know, on the qualifying petitions, it's stated up at the top of each page when you have to run| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=11604)|
| 3:13:30| what these people are signing for you for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=11610)|
| 3:13:32| And I believe on these school teachers that tried to get a petition here a few years ago to get there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=11612)|
| 3:13:38| it had to be on every page.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=11618)|
| 3:13:40| Is that right on the page?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=11620)|
| 3:13:41| Am I not correct where the people sign?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=11621)|
| 3:13:44| What state law says, yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=11624)|
| 3:13:45| State law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=11625)|
| 3:13:46| So, really, most of these petitions that I've seen, they're illegal petitions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=11626)|
| 3:13:49| They don't have it on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=11629)|
| 3:13:52| You know, and going back to what Commissioner Norman, I don't know where he went.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=11632)|
| 3:14:00| Commissioner Norman made the statement that there's a lot of people spending a lot of money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=11640)|
| 3:14:05| From what I've seen, there's a few people spending a lot of money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=11645)|
| 3:14:08| You know, it seems to me like they're trying to structure our government more like the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=11648)|
| 3:14:14| to where they can control our government more so because they've lost control of it up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=11654)|
| 3:14:18| Knox County has grown so large.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=11658)|
| 3:14:20| But I don't want to get into that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=11660)|
| 3:14:22| But I think these petitions are illegal because it's not at the heading of each one of them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=11662)|
| 3:14:26| where they're having us to sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=11666)|
| 3:14:28| Would that not be correct, Craig?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=11668)|
| 3:14:31| The one they presented to us had the actual wording of the, I think there's seven questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=11671)|
| 3:14:36| Well, they're split up, aren't they?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=11676)|
| 3:14:38| On the one side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=11678)|
| 3:14:40| Yes, four and three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=11680)|
| 3:14:41| And then you turn it around and it had a summary on the top of the page and then a name for some 30 signatures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=11681)|
| 3:14:46| Well, the ones I saw were just, I didn't see that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=11686)|
| 3:14:54| When they turn them in, you will be looking for that, won't you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=11694)|
| 3:14:56| Of course, yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=11696)|
| 3:14:57| Commissioner Harmon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=11697)|
| 3:14:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=11699)|
| 3:15:00| I want to concur with many of the statements of Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=11700)|
| 3:15:03| And I would just add that if giving incomplete and inexact answers were a jailable offense,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=11703)|
| 3:15:10| nearly all of us would be in the slammer at one point or another.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=11710)|
| 3:15:13| So let's not beat up on these folks too much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=11713)|
| 3:15:16| I think we have an opportunity here to say it's better for democracy if we vote on them individually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=11716)|
| 3:15:21| It's better for the county taxpayer's pocketbook if we avoid the cost of tabulation and put them on individually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=11721)|
| 3:15:27| It just makes sense to go that route.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=11727)|
| 3:15:31| Commissioner Moore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=11731)|
| 3:15:33| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=11733)|
| 3:15:34| I've got two statements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=11734)|
| 3:15:37| The first one is a major political party in this county has voted to oppose all of these amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=11737)|
| 3:15:48| The second comment that I have is that I think it's good for the citizens of this county for them to be put on through a signature base.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=11748)|
| 3:15:59| Because if we put it on, they're happy with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=11759)|
| 3:16:04| There's going to be no debate in the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=11764)|
| 3:16:06| People will just go out and if they hear nothing, they'll just vote for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=11766)|
| 3:16:10| This is going to set the stage for a good debate over the next couple of months if they get them on the ballot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=11770)|
| 3:16:16| And that's going to be the only way that we have debate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=11776)|
| 3:16:19| Because if we put them on, the paper and everybody's going to say they're good, they're going to be quiet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=11779)|
| 3:16:24| and people may go in there and just vote for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=11784)|
| 3:16:26| Because usually if it's on the ballot, they're going to vote for it most of the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=11786)|
| 3:16:30| So I think this is a way to get the citizens of Knox County educated over having debate for the next several months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=11790)|
| 3:16:40| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=11800)|
| 3:16:42| Yeah, Paul, I want to emphasize a little bit what you said and a little bit what the commissioners in the fourth district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=11802)|
| 3:16:48| I just want to relate to you all the experience that I had last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=11808)|
| 3:16:50| I was in a pretty large meeting and a gentleman stood up and said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=11810)|
| 3:16:53| hey, if you're against nepotism, I've got a little orange petition and a little white petition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=11813)|
| 3:16:57| and I'm going to pass these around to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=11817)|
| 3:16:59| And that's exactly what he did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=11819)|
| 3:17:01| He passed the petition, the signing part only.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=11821)|
| 3:17:05| And he kept, conveniently kept that in his hand and went through a whole room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=11825)|
| 3:17:10| And they were just signing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=11830)|
| 3:17:11| They didn't know what they were signing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=11831)|
| 3:17:12| I said, guys, do you know what you're signing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=11832)|
| 3:17:14| They didn't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=11834)|
| 3:17:16| They just knew that, well, they sort of knew this guy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=11836)|
| 3:17:18| And they went and just blindly signed it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=11838)|
| 3:17:21| So I'm like, y'all, they are not telling people here's what you are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=11841)|
| 3:17:26| They're taking one thing, a little buzz word, a little buzz phrase, you know, if it's a good thing, fine, it will pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=11846)|
| 3:17:33| But don't deceive the people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=11853)|
| 3:17:35| Tell them what they all are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=11855)|
| 3:17:37| They're educated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=11857)|
| 3:17:39| Commissioner Smith, you saw what I saw, just places for signature only.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=11859)|
| 3:17:44| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=11864)|
| 3:17:45| Just for signatures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=11865)|
| 3:17:46| That's the only thing that they passed out was just signature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=11866)|
| 3:17:48| You know, we have a process here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=11868)|
| 3:17:50| Same thing, Paul.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=11870)|
| 3:17:51| And the people put it on before on the wheel tax and the recall amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=11871)|
| 3:17:58| And they went through this process and got the signatures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=11878)|
| 3:18:02| What we're setting here, there's about 57 people who pushed this thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=11882)|
| 3:18:06| Every time 57 people come up here, we're going to put it on the ballot if 57 people want something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=11886)|
| 3:18:13| That's what we're setting this as presidents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=11893)|
| 3:18:17| My question, Greg, is that illegal, Greg?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=11897)|
| 3:18:19| If they just passed out the sheet of paper where you put your name, address, and all that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=11899)|
| 3:18:24| and didn't pass the other stuff with it, and I'm talking about a packed room full of people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=11904)|
| 3:18:29| and all they got was just a signature page only, was that illegal?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=11909)|
| 3:18:34| I'm not sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=11914)|
| 3:18:35| What was on the backside of the paper?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=11915)|
| 3:18:37| More signatures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=11917)|
| 3:18:40| Well, we wouldn't accept those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=11920)|
| 3:18:43| The petitions that we will accept have to have these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=11923)|
| 3:18:46| But how are you going to know that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=11926)|
| 3:18:48| You know, how are you going to know?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=11928)|
| 3:18:49| Just looking at the paper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=11929)|
| 3:18:50| Well, what if all of a sudden they start stapling stuff with it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=11930)|
| 3:18:54| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=11934)|
| 3:18:55| It's got to be on the same piece of paper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=11935)|
| 3:18:57| The law is very specific about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=11937)|
| 3:18:59| It's got to be on the same piece of paper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=11939)|
| 3:19:01| It's got to have the complete wording of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=11941)|
| 3:19:04| You couldn't just staple it on later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=11944)|
| 3:19:07| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=11947)|
| 3:19:09| Greg, a question for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=11949)|
| 3:19:11| When do the petitioners need to have their signatures in to you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=11951)|
| 3:19:15| By September 2nd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=11955)|
| 3:19:17| And how much time do you have to look at them and verify them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=11957)|
| 3:19:25| Well, it's hard to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=11965)|
| 3:19:27| We run into some deadlines on the 21st of September.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=11967)|
| 3:19:30| We need to send the military overseas ballots out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=11970)|
| 3:19:33| Although we've talked with people in Nashville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=11973)|
| 3:19:35| Brooke Thompson in particular,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=11975)|
| 3:19:37| and he's informed us that we could if we had to mail the federal ballot out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=11977)|
| 3:19:41| with the presidential and everything on it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=11981)|
| 3:19:43| and then mail the petition, the charter changes later,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=11983)|
| 3:19:46| if we were not done by that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=11986)|
| 3:19:48| It's just we're running into this next election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=11988)|
| 3:19:51| Will you start looking at those signatures on the 2nd?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=11991)|
| 3:19:54| I'll start the minute we get them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=11994)|
| 3:19:57| So what I'm trying to get at here is the soonest that we could meet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=11997)|
| 3:20:01| let's say this were to pass, would be the 5th to get for a second reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=12001)|
| 3:20:06| And then you have to have it by the 5th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=12006)|
| 3:20:09| So you're going to have to start looking at signatures anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=12009)|
| 3:20:13| But if they were to pass on the 5th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=12013)|
| 3:20:16| would you stop your looking at the signatures?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=12016)|
| 3:20:19| I would certainly try.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=12019)|
| 3:20:21| But you would go through about three or four days of the process?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=12021)|
| 3:20:25| At least.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=12025)|
| 3:20:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=12026)|
| 3:20:27| Commissioner Briggs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=12027)|
| 3:20:29| I think Commissioners Davis and Daniels and Moore have made,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=12029)|
| 3:20:37| and Pinkston and all have made a very compelling story as to why we need to put these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=12037)|
| 3:20:42| amendments on the ballot individually,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=12042)|
| 3:20:44| is that we've talked a lot about unintended consequences.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=12044)|
| 3:20:47| People don't know what they're voting for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=12047)|
| 3:20:49| We may end up having things in our charter that people don't want because they didn't understand it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=12049)|
| 3:20:54| I think that makes a very, to me, it's a very,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=12054)|
| 3:20:57| very compelling argument that we need to put it on simple and put them on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=12057)|
| 3:21:02| If you're for or against nepotism, there's nothing else there to get confused by.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=12062)|
| 3:21:08| And if we don't, these people do have a lot of money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=12068)|
| 3:21:13| And I have to say, and I think just for one other clarification,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=12073)|
| 3:21:17| I think the Republican Party said they were against this petition process that they're doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=12077)|
| 3:21:21| because these things are all lumped together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=12081)|
| 3:21:23| I don't think the Republican Party said that they were for nepotism.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=12083)|
| 3:21:28| They said they were against all these amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=12088)|
| 3:21:30| They said they were against the amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=12090)|
| 3:21:31| I was at the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=12091)|
| 3:21:32| They said they were against the amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=12092)|
| 3:21:34| Well, I'm going to have to go against the party then because I will not vote for nepotism| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=12094)|
| 3:21:38| and I will not vote for conflicts of interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=12098)|
| 3:21:41| But, anyway, I'll just stop right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=12101)|
| 3:21:43| But I think it's a very good argument of why they need to be put on there separately,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=12103)|
| 3:21:46| because I have a feeling that the ones that we don't like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=12106)|
| 3:21:49| and everybody knows what those are, will not pass if they're on separately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=12109)|
| 3:21:53| I don't know what's going to happen when you lump everything together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=12113)|
| 3:21:55| and then the propaganda and advertising campaign starts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=12115)|
| 3:22:01| And so I'm very much in support of Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=12121)|
| 3:22:08| Commissioner Davis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=12128)|
| 3:22:10| Yes, I just wanted to ask Commissioner Norman,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=12130)|
| 3:22:12| you said that you wanted to put all nine on the ballot, is that what you said?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=12132)|
| 3:22:17| All I want to do is move my motion is to have a special meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=12137)|
| 3:22:23| That's the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=12143)|
| 3:22:24| I just want to have the special meeting on the 29th after the new commissioners are sworn in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=12144)|
| 3:22:30| I'm not taking up any issue about any particular amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=12150)|
| 3:22:34| I just think every item needs to be individually considered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=12154)|
| 3:22:39| And the way to do this, the best way to do this now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=12159)|
| 3:22:42| is to get them considered in a special meeting on the 29th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=12162)|
| 3:22:46| Yes, sir, but what I'm asking you is, you said every item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=12166)|
| 3:22:49| Well, if that item includes nepotism, we just passed an ordinance on nepotism.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=12169)|
| 3:22:54| That's not necessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=12174)|
| 3:22:58| Then why are the petitioners still talking about nepotism| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=12178)|
| 3:23:01| when we've already passed an ordinance on nepotism?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=12181)|
| 3:23:04| Here's a good example, Miss Davis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=12184)|
| 3:23:06| We've got a commissioner here sitting and talking about nepotism.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=12186)|
| 3:23:11| And Commissioner Briggs said he couldn't be for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=12191)|
| 3:23:14| But we've passed this amendment that's against it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=12194)|
| 3:23:18| So that's how confusing this is to people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=12198)|
| 3:23:22| Commissioner DeFries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=12202)|
| 3:23:24| Thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=12204)|
| 3:23:26| My question is for the law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=12206)|
| 3:23:28| Mr. Law Director, when I go onto immunico.com and look up the Knox County Charter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=12208)|
| 3:23:35| it seems to me that the numbers on the petition don't match up with the current charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=12215)|
| 3:23:44| That's because Munico hasn't updated their website, but they're in the process of doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=12224)|
| 3:23:49| So the numbers on the petition, do they match up with the updated version of the charter?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=12229)|
| 3:23:55| They are accurate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=12235)|
| 3:23:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=12236)|
| 3:23:58| Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=12238)|

| 3:24:03| I want to call for the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=12243)|
| 3:24:07| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=12247)|

| 3:24:17| What about my light?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=12257)|
| 3:24:19| There's a motion for a call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=12259)|
| 3:24:22| I'd like to amend my call after these two lights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=12262)|

| 3:25:07| Please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=12307)|

| 3:25:22| Commissioner Pinkston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=12322)|
| 3:25:23| This was just a call for the question, wasn't it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=12323)|
| 3:25:25| It was a call for the question, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=12325)|
| 3:25:27| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=12327)|
| 3:25:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=12328)|
| 3:25:29| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=12329)|
| 3:25:30| I'm going to go ahead and pass this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=12330)|
| 3:25:31| This is a vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=12331)|
| 3:25:33| I'll show you the monitor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=12333)|
| 3:25:35| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=12335)|
| 3:25:38| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=12338)|
| 3:25:42| So disrespected people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=12342)|
| 3:25:44| I'm sorry, ten.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=12344)|
| 3:25:46| Nine ten.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=12346)|
| 3:25:47| It's two thirds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=12347)|
| 3:25:49| Motion fails ten to nine, nine to ten.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=12349)|
| 3:25:53| Commissioner Moore?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=12353)|
| 3:25:55| You know, Commissioner Briggs said that he's not for nepotism and conflict of interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=12355)|
| 3:26:00| And as we stated here a minute ago, we've passed conflict of interest and we've passed nepotism.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=12360)|
| 3:26:05| So, I mean, we've taken care of some of these things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=12365)|
| 3:26:09| So my party says that they're in opposition to them and I'm going to support my party,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=12369)|
| 3:26:15| unless we add the three things that some of my constituents wanted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=12375)|
| 3:26:19| Commissioner Lufo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=12379)|
| 3:26:20| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=12380)|
| 3:26:21| And thank you for those who voted no so we could have a chance to speak just like everybody else did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=12381)|
| 3:26:28| A couple of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=12388)|
| 3:26:29| I continue to hear from the charter amendment people, the accountability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=12389)|
| 3:26:36| They continue to misrepresent the Baker Center study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=12396)|
| 3:26:41| They keep calling it a best practices study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=12401)|
| 3:26:45| That's not true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=12405)|
| 3:26:47| In fact, the Baker Center people say that's not true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=12407)|
| 3:26:53| It is only what other communities are doing and it has no conclusions or recommendations that this is something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=12413)|
| 3:27:04| that Knox County should do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=12424)|
| 3:27:09| The second thing is if part of these amendments were to pass and others not, how does that affect,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=12429)|
| 3:27:23| because I would still assume that we still have these bundled amendments out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=12443)|
| 3:27:29| and then we have maybe some of them get passed by commission and some of them don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=12449)|
| 3:27:36| What happens in that case?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=12456)|
| 3:27:42| Mr. Law Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=12462)|
| 3:27:45| Thank you for asking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=12465)|
| 3:27:48| I think it may turn into a real mess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=12468)|
| 3:27:50| I mean, what you don't want to do is create a situation where the voters have one set of amendments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=12470)|
| 3:27:59| and then another set of amendments which vary those that the other ones that are on the ballot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=12479)|
| 3:28:06| And I know we changed a number of the amendments through our process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=12486)|
| 3:28:13| If you're going to create ambiguity, then that must result in a court action at some point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=12493)|
| 3:28:23| I mean, you have no choice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=12503)|
| 3:28:24| If the orange and the white petitions were to pass and you had a couple of the individual initiatives,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=12504)|
| 3:28:33| individual ordinances to fail, it sends a mixed signal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=12513)|
| 3:28:38| And I think that's quite possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=12518)|
| 3:28:42| So you don't want to create, Commissioner Harmon says vote for them all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=12522)|
| 3:28:50| You don't want to create a situation where you have variations of an ordinance, of a new charter amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=12530)|
| 3:29:02| You don't want to create a situation like that because it must be resolved by a court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=12542)|
| 3:29:12| I don't know if the charter group, the Knox Accountability Group, if they are committed to withdrawing their amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=12552)|
| 3:29:21| If the county commissions amendments and they're not exactly identical to the ones that they proposed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=12561)|
| 3:29:29| if they are passed by this body as it is newly reconstituted, will they withdraw their amendments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=12569)|
| 3:29:39| Will it save the county money?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=12579)|
| 3:29:41| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=12581)|
| 3:29:42| But I do know that you can create a situation that is very problematic for the voters| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=12582)|
| 3:29:50| and for Knox County government if you have variations that are passed and defeated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=12590)|
| 3:29:57| and it can create all kinds of situations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=12597)|
| 3:29:59| That was the second part of my question I was going to get to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=12599)|
| 3:30:02| What if we had a, say, a nepotism policy that was different from the nepotism part of their petition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=12602)|
| 3:30:11| and they both, let's say, passed and then you've, which one prevails?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=12611)|
| 3:30:20| If you can read them, and we have an obligation to read any amendment or any statute,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=12620)|
| 3:30:28| hopefully in concert with the others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=12628)|
| 3:30:31| But if there are conflicts, then there has to be a resolution of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=12631)|
| 3:30:36| If you have two charter amendments that are in conflict, you've got a real problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=12636)|
| 3:30:41| We've got a real problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=12641)|
| 3:30:45| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=12645)|
| 3:30:49| I turned off my light.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=12649)|
| 3:30:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=12651)|
| 3:30:52| Commissioner Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=12652)|
| 3:30:53| I don't really agree with what Commissioner Luthold, the point he just brought up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=12653)|
| 3:30:58| Because there is a difference in the dates, I think one was September the 2nd| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=12658)|
| 3:31:03| and for us it would be September the 5th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=12663)|
| 3:31:05| If the accountability group did not withdraw their petitions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=12665)|
| 3:31:10| then I just can't see how we can be voting on these things, you know, on a second reading| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=12670)|
| 3:31:16| as we approach September the 5th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=12676)|
| 3:31:18| I think we should avoid that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=12678)|
| 3:31:20| I don't know how the rest of the group feels about it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=12680)|
| 3:31:22| but I don't want us to get in one of those situations where we have two sets of amendments on the charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=12682)|
| 3:31:29| And it has to be on September the 5th because we have to have seven days between.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=12689)|
| 3:31:35| Commissioner Zook.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=12695)|
| 3:31:36| I'm finished, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=12696)|
| 3:31:37| Commissioner Moore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=12697)|
| 3:31:38| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=12698)|
| 3:31:39| Just sitting here thinking, Greg, if the petition group, Knox Accountability,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=12699)|
| 3:31:45| turns in their petitions on the second and you all start counting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=12705)|
| 3:31:51| who has the authority to withdraw that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=12711)|
| 3:31:58| I'm not sure if anybody does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=12718)|
| 3:32:00| So it would go forward anyway, no matter what we did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=12720)|
| 3:32:04| Because if it's only the people, a few people that whoever's ahead of this accountability could withdraw it, wouldn't it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=12724)|
| 3:32:11| That would be self-serving, wouldn't it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=12731)|
| 3:32:14| I haven't seen anything where they could withdraw it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=12734)|
| 3:32:18| So if you turn in 40,000 people, signatures, that means 40,000 people would,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=12738)|
| 3:32:23| I don't know if you'd have to get all of them to withdraw it or even if you could withdraw it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=12743)|
| 3:32:28| That's my question to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=12748)|
| 3:32:29| You wouldn't have time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=12749)|
| 3:32:30| You wouldn't have time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=12750)|
| 3:32:33| If I got a petition and it was obvious there were not enough names, then I would not have to count it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=12753)|
| 3:32:38| No, but say that they give you 50,000 names and we pass something on the 5th and somebody,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=12758)|
| 3:32:44| I don't know who that somebody would be from Knox Accountability to come in and say, Greg,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=12764)|
| 3:32:47| we want to withdraw this petition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=12767)|
| 3:32:49| The county commission put these on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=12769)|
| 3:32:52| Who would that person be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=12772)|
| 3:32:55| I haven't seen anything that would allow them to withdraw them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=12775)|
| 3:33:00| I don't know if there is such a person that can do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=12780)|
| 3:33:02| I think the law director can shed some light on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=12782)|
| 3:33:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=12784)|
| 3:33:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=12785)|
| 3:33:06| John, do you know?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=12786)|
| 3:33:08| No, I do not know the answer to that question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=12788)|
| 3:33:12| If you had it, if we had the process done before September 2,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=12792)|
| 3:33:15| obviously they don't have to submit the petitions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=12795)|
| 3:33:18| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=12798)|
| 3:33:19| But once they're submitted, we can do a little research on that and have that information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=12799)|
| 3:33:27| But we've never been asked that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=12807)|
| 3:33:30| And I've not seen the answer to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=12810)|
| 3:33:34| Commissioner DeFreeze.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=12814)|
| 3:33:35| Call for the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=12815)|
| 3:33:38| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=12818)|
| 3:33:42| We have a call for the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=12822)|
| 3:33:44| It looks like the lights are on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=12824)|
| 3:33:46| Lights are on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=12826)|
| 3:33:47| Lights are on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=12827)|
| 3:33:48| Withdraw.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=12828)|
| 3:33:49| Withdraw.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=12829)|
| 3:33:51| Make a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=12831)|
| 3:33:52| The motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=12832)|
| 3:33:54| We have a motion on the floor to have a special call meeting on the 29th after all the other meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=12834)|
| 3:34:03| After the swearing in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=12843)|
| 3:34:05| Well, we have something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=12845)|
| 3:34:06| For the new commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=12846)|
| 3:34:07| Or to add to the agenda of the special call meeting after the swearing in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=12847)|
| 3:34:11| Well, we have a hearing after the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=12851)|
| 3:34:14| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=12854)|
| 3:34:15| After that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=12855)|
| 3:34:16| Then after.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=12856)|
| 3:34:17| But on the 29th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=12857)|
| 3:34:20| I guess you'd have to have not only the special meeting to vote on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=12860)|
| 3:34:23| but then we'd also have to have a special meeting of the public hearing on the 29th because then you've got to have two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=12863)|
| 3:34:29| and then you'd have another one on the fifth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=12869)|
| 3:34:31| So we're actually, we have to be voting on actually two meetings on the 29th, not just one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=12871)|
| 3:34:37| We could go ahead and say we could have another meeting on another day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=12877)|
| 3:34:41| Well, we got a call for the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=12881)|
| 3:34:42| So it's going to be cut off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=12882)|
| 3:34:43| No, she withdrew it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=12883)|
| 3:34:45| Oh, you withdrew it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=12885)|
| 3:34:46| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=12886)|
| 3:34:47| Off of the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=12887)|
| 3:34:49| There's no need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=12889)|
| 3:34:51| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=12891)|
| 3:34:52| We had more discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=12892)|
| 3:34:53| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=12893)|
| 3:34:54| Do we have a second for that call?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=12894)|
| 3:35:00| We're voting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=12900)|
| 3:35:01| Starting in the first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=12901)|
| 3:35:02| Voting on the call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=12902)|
| 3:35:03| Voting on the call because we started back debate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=12903)|
| 3:35:06| Do we get to have a roll call for questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=12906)|
| 3:35:08| Yes, we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=12908)|
| 3:35:10| Starting in the first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=12910)|
| 3:35:12| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=12912)|

| 3:35:45| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=12945)|
| 3:35:46| I think it's unanimous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=12946)|
| 3:35:47| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=12947)|
| 3:35:48| The motion on the floor is to have a special call meeting on the 29th and the 5th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=12948)|
| 3:35:55| Yeah, that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=12955)|
| 3:35:59| Does this include the public hearings?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=12959)|
| 3:36:03| Does this include the public hearings?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=12963)|
| 3:36:04| To have a special meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=12964)|
| 3:36:05| A special meeting on the 29th and the 5th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=12965)|
| 3:36:09| That means it requires a special majority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=12969)|
| 3:36:16| This requires just a simple majority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=12976)|
| 3:36:18| I thought just ten people could do a special meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=12978)|
| 3:36:22| What's going on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=12982)|
| 3:36:23| Just a simple majority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=12983)|
| 3:36:25| And I know we're going to have some conflict, so let's have a roll call vote starting in the ninth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=12985)|
| 3:36:29| What's the special meeting for?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=12989)|
| 3:36:33| I think he's been sleeping the last hour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=12993)|
| 3:36:35| Are we voting on it or?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=12995)|
| 3:36:38| Would you repeat your motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=12998)|
| 3:36:40| We're adding all of the petitioner's items to the ballot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=13000)|
| 3:36:45| Is that including my three?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=13005)|
| 3:36:46| Individually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=13006)|
| 3:36:48| Individually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=13008)|
| 3:36:49| Is that including my three?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=13009)|
| 3:36:51| Not including your three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=13011)|
| 3:36:53| Could I add them to it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=13013)|
| 3:36:54| Is everyone clear on the motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=13014)|
| 3:36:56| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=13016)|
| 3:36:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=13018)|
| 3:36:59| Is everyone clear on the motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=13019)|
| 3:37:00| Well, that's the item as they have them on the ballot, is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=13020)|
| 3:37:03| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=13023)|
| 3:37:05| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=13025)|
| 3:37:07| My understanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=13027)|
| 3:37:08| Starting in the ninth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=13028)|
| 3:37:11| Mr. Pinkston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=13031)|
| 3:37:12| Just a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=13032)|
| 3:37:13| Mr. Law Director, you said as they have them on the ballot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=13033)|
| 3:37:16| That's, I believe that's the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=13036)|
| 3:37:18| That's what I wanted to make sure we were clear on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=13038)|
| 3:37:20| It's to add these individually to the ballot as they are so stated in their collective forms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=13040)|
| 3:37:27| In their collective form, they've got them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=13047)|
| 3:37:29| Now, if we.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=13049)|
| 3:37:30| Two petitions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=13050)|
| 3:37:31| Two petitioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=13051)|
| 3:37:32| What Mr. Norman is saying is he's going to separate them out individually in individual amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=13052)|
| 3:37:38| So the ballot would have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=13058)|
| 3:37:39| That's what we're going to discuss, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=13059)|
| 3:37:41| The ballot could possibly have their two, four and three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=13061)|
| 3:37:47| It's four and three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=13067)|
| 3:37:48| And then it would have those individually on the ballot as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=13068)|
| 3:37:52| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=13072)|
| 3:37:53| The motion is just to have a meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=13073)|
| 3:37:55| The motion is to have a meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=13075)|
| 3:37:57| On the 29th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=13077)|
| 3:37:58| Those items will occur on the 29th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=13078)|
| 3:38:02| Do you have a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=13082)|
| 3:38:04| Yeah, he has a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=13084)|
| 3:38:05| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=13085)|
| 3:38:07| The question has been called.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=13087)|
| 3:38:08| How the motion is, is to have a meeting on the 29th to discuss and.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=13088)|
| 3:38:15| Approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=13095)|
| 3:38:16| Possibly approve on first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=13096)|
| 3:38:21| Did I make a substitute motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=13101)|
| 3:38:23| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=13103)|
| 3:38:27| But a substitute motion would trump the call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=13107)|
| 3:38:30| Is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=13110)|
| 3:38:31| No, I won't say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=13111)|
| 3:38:32| I don't want to call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=13112)|

| 3:39:33| Motion fails ten to nine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=13173)|
| 3:39:36| Two people on public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=13176)|
| 3:39:38| Brad May is still here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=13178)|
| 3:39:46| I've got it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=13186)|
| 3:39:48| Now, folks, I want to give Brad a hand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=13188)|
| 3:39:50| He's been a trooper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=13190)|
| 3:39:51| He's been here since two o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=13191)|
| 3:39:53| It's getting more than five minutes, not literally, but.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=13193)|
| 3:39:58| I won't even take five minutes tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=13198)|
| 3:40:00| My name is Brad Mays.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=13200)|
| 3:40:01| I live at 1817 Plum Branch Road, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37932.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=13201)|
| 3:40:07| You all have heard me talk many times,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=13207)|
| 3:40:09| and you've been very gracious talking to me and listening to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=13209)|
| 3:40:14| There's been a few little things I wanted to just do a little housecleaning on, housekeeping.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=13214)|
| 3:40:19| There was recently an article in the Sentinel that misstated some things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=13219)|
| 3:40:23| It wasn't by Miss Farrar here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=13223)|
| 3:40:26| She got her articles accurate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=13226)|
| 3:40:29| But there was some retractions on one of the stories, so I wanted to inform you commissioners of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=13229)|
| 3:40:37| I wanted to thank you all just for putting up with me through all of this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=13237)|
| 3:40:42| and to inform you that my intentions were true through this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=13242)|
| 3:40:46| It has nothing to do with this contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=13246)|
| 3:40:50| It has to do with four major concerns I had when I started this litigation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=13250)|
| 3:40:56| Number one was to stop the biosolids because I didn't think that they were being treated adequately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=13256)|
| 3:41:01| And interestingly enough, after Knox County tested them in March| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=13261)|
| 3:41:05| and they got samples testing even worse than mine, they did drop the biosolids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=13265)|
| 3:41:10| And I feel that that's done a good service to our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=13270)|
| 3:41:12| Biosolids composting is important, but not if we can't do it adequately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=13272)|
| 3:41:17| Number two, that we start receiving rent on this facility, which now we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=13277)|
| 3:41:22| Number three, that Mr. Popp and the neighbors be informed about the truth of the spills that happened| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=13282)|
| 3:41:29| and have an opportunity to finally test their wells, even if it's four years later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=13289)|
| 3:41:34| And number four, to try and collect this back rent, which I'm currently still pursuing on behalf of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=13294)|
| 3:41:42| And I would be even happier if Knox County would just drop out of my case| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=13302)|
| 3:41:47| and allow me to pursue it at my own expense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=13307)|
| 3:41:49| I think I could be much more successful on my own.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=13309)|
| 3:41:53| The last thing that I wanted to tell you all about is, and I hate having to do this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=13313)|
| 3:42:00| I've had multiple people inform me recently about certain statements that have been made about me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=13320)|
| 3:42:07| mischaracterizations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=13327)|
| 3:42:10| During the course of this, I've had e-mails sent that were supposedly from Bradwith Plum Creek that were not from me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=13330)|
| 3:42:17| to attorneys involved with this case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=13337)|
| 3:42:23| I've been misled a few times on a few things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=13343)|
| 3:42:26| I've had several commissioners call me and thank me for my time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=13346)|
| 3:42:29| and I appreciate those of you that have called me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=13349)|
| 3:42:32| I've felt a lot of times like I've been out here in the middle of the ocean by myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=13352)|
| 3:42:37| But the thing that disturbs me the most is the mischaracterizations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=13357)|
| 3:42:42| I was mischaracterized as being Lynn May's son, that he was in the mulch business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=13362)|
| 3:42:46| It was completely false.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=13366)|
| 3:42:49| I was mischaracterized as being interested in this contract| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=13369)|
| 3:42:51| and starting trouble to try and get this contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=13371)|
| 3:42:54| I have no interest in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=13374)|
| 3:42:57| And I've been mischaracterized as being an agent for another mulch company,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=13377)|
| 3:43:01| which is completely false.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=13381)|
| 3:43:05| I never cared who got this contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=13385)|
| 3:43:07| That's not what I've been here for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=13387)|
| 3:43:09| What I care about is contaminated materials sold to the public, the taxpayer dollars,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=13389)|
| 3:43:15| hundreds of thousands of dollars of our money go and gone in pure violation of state procurement code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=13395)|
| 3:43:22| And everybody wanted to say that was okay, and that's not okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=13402)|
| 3:43:27| I don't give away hundreds of thousands of dollars in violation of state law,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=13407)|
| 3:43:30| and I wouldn't expect my government to do that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=13410)|
| 3:43:35| But most recently, I've been informed by multiple people that I was allegedly me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=13415)|
| 3:43:42| and another person involved with sabotaging| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=13422)|
| 3:43:47| or somehow going after former Senator Tim Burchett and his mulch business several years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=13427)|
| 3:43:56| And it was accused that me and or another person that I've been accused of was involved with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=13436)|
| 3:44:03| That's completely false.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=13443)|
| 3:44:07| The reason I've decided to tell you all this, and what mostly disappointed me about this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=13447)|
| 3:44:13| is this one came from a commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=13453)|
| 3:44:17| And I've confronted that commissioner tonight over it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=13457)|
| 3:44:21| Folks, I have spent no telling how many thousands of dollars at this point trying to stop this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=13461)|
| 3:44:29| trying to do what's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=13469)|
| 3:44:34| I audited 2007 the other night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=13474)|
| 3:44:39| We had $115,000 paid to a grading contractor with no performance or RFP, no purchasing, never,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=13479)|
| 3:44:49| the county commission never even knew about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=13489)|
| 3:44:52| Nobody approved that spending.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=13492)|
| 3:44:54| We had another $27,000 paid last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=13494)|
| 3:44:57| This is just 07 I'm talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=13497)|
| 3:45:00| To pay another grinding company to go grind their mulch for them, which was their responsibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=13500)|
| 3:45:07| And we also waived the payment on 77,000 yards of mulch that they manufactured on site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=13507)|
| 3:45:14| It wasn't imported at $1.50 a yard, which was over $100,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=13514)|
| 3:45:19| Last year alone, the county staff gave away over a quarter of a million dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=13519)|
| 3:45:29| Either gave it away or spent it in ways that violated state procurement code,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=13529)|
| 3:45:34| just for this one facility for one year, just one year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=13534)|
| 3:45:39| We've had these actions going on for five years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=13539)|
| 3:45:43| What else should I do as a citizen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=13543)|
| 3:45:49| I tried to talk to the mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=13549)|
| 3:45:51| He shut me down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=13551)|
| 3:45:52| And he was belligerent to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=13552)|
| 3:45:55| I've tried to talk to my county commissioners and I was mischaracterized and lied on and lied to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=13555)|
| 3:46:04| What should I do as a citizen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=13564)|
| 3:46:06| Everybody made a big deal because I'm a mulch contractor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=13566)|
| 3:46:09| You wouldn't expect a pizza parlor to catch this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=13569)|
| 3:46:12| It takes someone who has been in this industry their entire life to understand the regulations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=13572)|
| 3:46:20| the rules, how the business works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=13580)|
| 3:46:24| Mr. Hammond mentioned that there must be a lot of money in this for people to chase this this way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=13584)|
| 3:46:32| And I would agree that you're correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=13592)|
| 3:46:35| All of the major parties in this are self-made millionaires, including myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=13595)|
| 3:46:40| I'm not saying that to brag to you, but to inform you, this is not about a few scoops of mulch,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=13600)|
| 3:46:45| whether or not I sell a few scoops of mulch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=13605)|
| 3:46:50| I never looked for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=13610)|
| 3:46:53| This looked for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=13613)|
| 3:46:56| Knox County employees tried to force me to enter into an agreement where I was not allowed to buy mulch from nobody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=13616)|
| 3:47:02| but natural resources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=13622)|
| 3:47:04| This raised red flags in my mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=13624)|
| 3:47:06| It prompted me to look into this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=13626)|
| 3:47:10| And I found hundreds and hundreds of thousands of dollars being handed out in pure violation of state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=13630)|
| 3:47:16| procurement code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=13636)|
| 3:47:18| And no one, no one has really stepped up to bat except for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=13638)|
| 3:47:25| And I've been in this battle by myself with the exception of a few commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=13645)|
| 3:47:32| But here recently I feel like the opinion of most of you all, the exception of one commissioner in particular I'm aware of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=13652)|
| 3:47:40| now, has changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=13660)|
| 3:47:43| And you realize that my intentions are sincere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=13663)|
| 3:47:47| I don't need the money from this litigation, folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=13667)|
| 3:47:52| If I needed it, I wouldn't have gave the mayor several months' opportunity to fix this problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=13672)|
| 3:48:00| If I was out to get the money, I would have never gave him the heads up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=13680)|
| 3:48:05| I've done this because this was my only tool in the world as a citizen to do something about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=13685)|
| 3:48:15| And I almost regret it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=13695)|
| 3:48:19| I almost regret it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=13699)|
| 3:48:22| Commissioner Lambert, when you tell people in my community that I have assisted people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=13702)|
| 3:48:29| Brad, I've given you seven, seven, eight million minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=13709)|
| 3:48:32| I feel that I wish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=13712)|
| 3:48:34| I don't think you need to get, I don't think you need to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=13714)|
| 3:48:36| I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=13716)|
| 3:48:37| I would respectfully ask that those statements be retracted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=13717)|
| 3:48:42| I'm not trying to be impolite.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=13722)|
| 3:48:44| But they weren't true and there's no base for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=13724)|
| 3:48:47| The person that is supposedly my co-conspirator didn't even live in this state at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=13727)|
| 3:48:56| I know Senator Burchette.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=13736)|
| 3:48:58| There's nothing I'd ever do in the world to hurt him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=13738)|
| 3:49:02| I'm so tired of being mischaracterized for trying to do the right thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=13742)|
| 3:49:08| I have fought this out of my pocket at great expense, not only to my integrity and my reputation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=13748)|
| 3:49:15| I've been made to look like a liar on the front page of the Knoxville News Sentinel multiple times| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=13755)|
| 3:49:20| to the point that I became ashamed to attend my church.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=13760)|
| 3:49:29| I had a lawyer stand in front of a judge the other day and say the evidence I produced was all false.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=13769)|
| 3:49:36| I didn't produce any evidence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=13776)|
| 3:49:37| It was on their letterheads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=13777)|
| 3:49:38| It's their documents, not mine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=13778)|
| 3:49:42| Brad, you need to wrap it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=13782)|
| 3:49:46| I just respectfully ask that you all keep this into consideration the next time a citizen comes to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=13786)|
| 3:49:56| You really don't know what their motives are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=13796)|
| 3:50:02| No one knows what it's like to be a whistleblower.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=13802)|
| 3:50:08| I've had my shop busted into.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=13808)|
| 3:50:12| I've had people hijack my website.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=13812)|
| 3:50:17| I've had erroneous e-mails, phone calls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=13817)|
| 3:50:23| I have had everything in the world from ruining my reputation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=13823)|
| 3:50:30| And I have spent thousands upon thousands of dollars doing the right thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=13830)|
| 3:50:38| I'm not trying to start trouble with Mr. Pop and telling him about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=13838)|
| 3:50:44| I begged your mayor to warn them about their will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=13844)|
| 3:50:48| I told Mr. Draper to warn them about their will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=13848)|
| 3:50:52| What I was informed is that the company tried to rent his house but never told him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=13852)|
| 3:50:57| I didn't want to have to, but I had to because nobody else would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=13857)|
| 3:51:02| Those lab reports are accurate that Mr. Pop took.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=13862)|
| 3:51:08| Brad, I'm going to have to ask you to wrap it up, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=13868)|
| 3:51:11| I apologize, Tank.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=13871)|
| 3:51:14| I know I'm going to look like an emotional idiot to everybody in Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=13874)|
| 3:51:20| but you don't understand the battle I've been through to do the right thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=13880)|
| 3:51:26| when I see materials sold that I know are dangerous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=13886)|
| 3:51:32| And you don't know how many stories I've heard as a response.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=13892)|
| 3:51:38| I wish that we had a new system for whistleblowers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=13898)|
| 3:51:42| This one doesn't work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=13902)|
| 3:51:44| And the next time if I find $10 million gone, I'll never tell you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=13904)|
| 3:51:51| Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=13911)|
| 3:51:54| Brad, I just wanted to thank you for the work you've done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=13914)|
| 3:51:58| Biosolids and this odor problem has been an issue that I worked on extensively| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=13918)|
| 3:52:05| throughout the first two years of my term of office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=13925)|
| 3:52:08| And you were a big help in helping to bring that to a head.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=13928)|
| 3:52:12| You've achieved good things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=13932)|
| 3:52:15| You've won victories.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=13935)|
| 3:52:18| Now, lately, a lot of the things that you've been bringing to us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=13938)|
| 3:52:21| I don't have the ability to determine, you know, to do the testing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=13941)|
| 3:52:27| As far as the arsenic issues, I would hope that you would forward those on to the appropriate agencies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=13947)|
| 3:52:34| their state and federal agencies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=13954)|
| 3:52:37| I would hope that you would forward them on to the appropriate agencies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=13957)|
| 3:52:42| This commission just, we don't have the talent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=13962)|
| 3:52:46| and we don't have the authority to do anything about those issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=13966)|
| 3:52:50| And I would hope that you would forward them to the right folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=13970)|
| 3:52:54| If I've repeated any rumors, of course, I never even heard the one that you were,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=13974)|
| 3:52:59| I've heard that some other mulch contractors, not yourself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=13979)|
| 3:53:03| were involved in the issue several years ago with Mr. Burchett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=13983)|
| 3:53:07| But I hadn't even heard that rumor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=13987)|
| 3:53:09| But if I have repeated rumors that have in some way hurt your feelings, then I am really sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=13989)|
| 3:53:15| This has been very frustrating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=13995)|
| 3:53:18| You know, when you bring stuff before us that we just don't have the authority| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=13998)|
| 3:53:23| or the ability to do anything about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=14003)|
| 3:53:26| And so in the future, I would just hope that I appreciate all the work you've done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=14006)|
| 3:53:30| You've helped rid my community of a horrible stench.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=14010)|
| 3:53:35| But I just hope that in the future that you would forward these environmental complaints| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=14015)|
| 3:53:40| to folks that have the talent and the authority to do something about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=14020)|
| 3:53:44| But I do appreciate all the work that you've done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=14024)|
| 3:53:46| And it's 10 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=14026)|
| 3:53:47| We're supposed to walk out on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=14027)|
| 3:53:52| Commissioner Smith, we should have walked out on Loppy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=14032)|
| 3:53:55| Brad, I just want to say thank you for what you did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=14035)|
| 3:53:57| And good luck for what you plan to do with this in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=14037)|
| 3:54:00| I'll be watching very closely how it goes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=14040)|
| 3:54:02| Good luck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=14042)|
| 3:54:03| Thank you, Brad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=14043)|
| 3:54:05| We have one more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=14045)|
| 3:54:06| Mr. Jensen, is he still here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=14046)|
| 3:54:09| Chuck Jensen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=14049)|
| 3:54:20| Chuck Jensen, 2215 Bright Oak Way, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37931.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=14060)|
| 3:54:26| As you may well remember, about a week ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=14066)|
| 3:54:28| I sent a communication to all of the commissioners making an offer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=14068)|
| 3:54:33| to look into the issue that has been open here in the community for quite some time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=14073)|
| 3:54:39| and that is whether there was arsenic-contaminated ash that was buried at the NRR site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=14079)|
| 3:54:47| And the offer was made for the simple purpose of getting at the facts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=14087)|
| 3:54:53| And I have no relationship to any commissioner, no groups, no parties outside of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=14093)|
| 3:55:02| or inside of the county mayor's office or anyplace else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=14102)|
| 3:55:07| I do live in Carnes, and business is in the Carnes-Sulway area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=14107)|
| 3:55:13| Looking at this, the offer was made with the simple purpose of getting this resolved once and for all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=14113)|
| 3:55:20| There's been a large number of claims and counterclaims, some of them factually based, perhaps,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=14120)|
| 3:55:28| but nobody knows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=14128)|
| 3:55:30| This is a very simple and straightforward method of resolving it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=14130)|
