| 0:11:37| Correct me if I'm wrong, I think this has changed names like three times in the last| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=697)|
| 0:11:47| three or four years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=707)|

| 0:11:51| That's what I mean, owners, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=711)|
| 0:11:54| Three or four times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=714)|
| 0:11:55| I mean, I'm going to vote to support it, but it gives me a little uneasy when owners keep constantly changing the business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=715)|
| 0:12:08| Well, that's not entirely true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=728)|

| 0:12:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=741)|

| 0:12:25| No, I just, when you see ownership changing, it just kind of makes you uneasy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=745)|
| 0:12:31| I said I'm going to support it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=751)|
| 0:12:32| It's not a big deal, but that's all I have to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=752)|

| 0:17:47| Is there a motion we add what needs to be added, delete what needs to be deleted, and defer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=1067)|

| 0:18:14| We're going to move that to the front.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=1094)|

| 0:18:25| And then 111 for the ethics will come next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=1105)|

| 0:18:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=1126)|
| 0:18:47| I am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=1127)|
| 0:18:48| My name is Ernie Roberts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=1128)|
| 0:18:49| I am a resident here in Knoxville, Tennessee, 2240 West Glenwood Avenue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=1129)|
| 0:18:54| and I'm representing East Tennessee PBS today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=1134)|
| 0:18:58| And we want to thank you for the opportunity to bring forth a new venture into our PBS media agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=1138)|
| 0:19:05| We are working on and we are already putting it out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=1145)|
| 0:19:08| Seventy shows already we have screened and aired of Math Line, which is a call-in help,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=1148)|
| 0:19:15| free help offered to students who wish to call in, not just for locals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=1155)|
| 0:19:19| but we also stretch out into many counties in East Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=1159)|
| 0:19:23| The majority of our calls have come in, and we do, by the way, appear from 6 to 630 every weeknight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=1163)|
| 0:19:30| It's call-in for four nights of those weeks, again, 6 to 630.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=1170)|
| 0:19:34| And we have had great response from local and also from outwards of 18 to 20 counties that have called in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=1174)|
| 0:19:41| We've even heard from southeastern Kentucky.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=1181)|
| 0:19:43| But we are centered right here in the heart of Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=1183)|
| 0:19:46| and we're glad to be able to perform this service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=1186)|
| 0:19:49| We started August the 11th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=1189)|
| 0:19:50| As I said, we have 70 shows already that have gone on air.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=1190)|
| 0:19:54| We will have close to 180 by the end of the school year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=1194)|
| 0:19:57| And we are here through the end of May at least and hopefully beyond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=1197)|
| 0:20:02| First of all, a little background on East Tennessee PBS.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=1202)|
| 0:20:04| My CEO, Miss Vicki Lawson, was unable to be here today due to illness and to come with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=1204)|
| 0:20:11| But her mission and our mission at PBS is that we want to educate from cradle to the grave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=1211)|
| 0:20:17| Many of you know, of course, the PBS shows that we've all grown up with that teach the elementary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=1217)|
| 0:20:22| and younger ages in their formative years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=1222)|
| 0:20:25| We now have added MathLine for elementary, middle, and high school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=1225)|
| 0:20:29| And we're even having folks who are in their 40s, 50s,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=1229)|
| 0:20:32| all the way up to an 80-year-old person has called me in about how to work a math problem and things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=1232)|
| 0:20:37| So we're having a good time with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=1237)|
| 0:20:40| There's a lot of good things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=1240)|
| 0:20:41| PBS is almost now 50 years here in East Tennessee in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=1241)|
| 0:20:46| And again, we have been running Scholars Bowl for East Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=1246)|
| 0:20:50| and many, many Knox County schools for over 30 years, 31 years this past year we just wrapped up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=1250)|
| 0:20:55| And again, now we want to continue our education mission and help put forth a chance for students to call in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=1255)|
| 0:21:02| We understand 30 minutes is not a cure-all, but it's a way we have resources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=1262)|
| 0:21:06| We want to help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=1266)|
| 0:21:07| We want to be a part of continuing to grow education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=1267)|
| 0:21:12| Math seems to be one of the major keys to success in the futures of our students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=1272)|
| 0:21:16| And we want to make this accessible and also out there on a day-to-day basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=1276)|
| 0:21:23| And we're hoping to eventually be able to stream these things online and put our videos there also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=1283)|
| 0:21:28| So we are just beginning the tip.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=1288)|
| 0:21:29| We want to help working with also professional development with teachers on down the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=1289)|
| 0:21:35| We are wanting to get back into really being a strong education business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=1295)|
| 0:21:39| So we wanted to let you be aware that we are here on Magnolia.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=1299)|
| 0:21:43| And we are now being, you can see me, and also we just added another teacher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=1303)|
| 0:21:49| So you can see us on 6 to 630 on Monday through Thursday, call in, and Friday night we do a theme show,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=1309)|
| 0:21:55| which basically focuses on one of the aspects of mathematics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=1315)|
| 0:21:59| Would you all have any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=1319)|
| 0:22:02| Any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=1322)|
| 0:22:03| Thank you for what you're doing, and hopefully we can partner with you later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=1323)|
| 0:22:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=1326)|
| 0:22:07| We appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=1327)|
| 0:22:08| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=1328)|
| 0:22:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=1329)|
| 0:22:30| On page three,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=1350)|
| 0:22:34| we have a resolution of the Commission of Knox County, Tennessee appointing, reappointing to the Knox County Ethics Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=1354)|
| 0:22:40| This is Resolution 111.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=1360)|
| 0:22:43| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=1363)|
| 0:22:45| I think we had some discussion about this in workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=1365)|
| 0:22:48| You guys had some discussion about this in workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=1368)|
| 0:22:50| And Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=1370)|
| 0:22:53| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=1373)|
| 0:22:54| I believe that in the work session we had a nominations session which ended up with two names in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=1374)|
| 0:23:05| We now have maybe more names than those two,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=1385)|
| 0:23:10| so I'd like to offer a motion that any nominations received today also be considered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=1390)|
| 0:23:19| The nomination be reopened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=1399)|
| 0:23:21| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=1401)|
| 0:23:22| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=1402)|
| 0:23:23| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=1403)|
| 0:23:24| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=1404)|
| 0:23:26| Is there anybody who would like to make a nomination?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=1406)|
| 0:23:30| Or do you want to just use the current list that we have of Mr. Cosby, Mr. McCook, Mr. Cooper, and Mr. Brown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=1410)|
| 0:23:39| Is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=1419)|
| 0:23:43| Louis Cosby was on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=1423)|
| 0:23:44| Oh, that's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=1424)|
| 0:23:48| Are we talking about the retirement committee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=1428)|
| 0:23:50| Oh, ethics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=1430)|
| 0:23:51| Okay, ethics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=1431)|
| 0:23:52| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=1432)|
| 0:23:53| I guess just as a point of information,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=1433)|
| 0:23:59| I think Commissioner Brantley brought Mr. Cosby's name up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=1439)|
| 0:24:04| but then they talked about him being a former member, so I don't know if his name is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=1444)|
| 0:24:08| Yeah, his name is withdrawn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=1448)|
| 0:24:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=1450)|
| 0:24:11| Withdrawn?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=1451)|
| 0:24:12| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=1452)|
| 0:24:13| So the three names that we have are Brown, Cooper, and McCook.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=1453)|
| 0:24:18| Is that, Commissioner Smith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=1458)|
| 0:24:19| I think we had a Mr. Daniels on there, too, and he sent in a letter wanting to be withdrawn also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=1459)|
| 0:24:23| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=1463)|
| 0:24:24| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=1464)|
| 0:24:26| Any other nominations from the commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=1466)|
| 0:24:30| What we'll do is we'll go, we'll start in Commission District 1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=1470)|
| 0:24:36| Mr. Chairman, if any are here and would like to address us, I believe they should be recognized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=1476)|
| 0:24:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=1479)|
| 0:24:40| I believe I've seen Mr. Cooper and Mr. Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=1480)|
| 0:24:43| Is Mr. McCook here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=1483)|
| 0:24:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=1487)|
| 0:24:48| Would you wish to speak, Mr. Cooper, or do you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=1488)|
| 0:24:51| It's up to you, totally up to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=1491)|
| 0:24:54| Come down and give your name and address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=1494)|
| 0:25:00| Good afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=1500)|
| 0:25:01| My name is Jonathan Cooper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=1501)|
| 0:25:02| I live at 5416 Crestwood Road in Fountain City.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=1502)|
| 0:25:06| I'll be glad to answer any questions that the commission has.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=1506)|
| 0:25:13| Go ahead, Commissioner Brantley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=1513)|
| 0:25:14| I'll just ask you a very simple question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=1514)|
| 0:25:15| Why do you want to do this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=1515)|
| 0:25:19| Well, I would be interested in serving the county in any way that I can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=1519)|
| 0:25:25| My name, I believe, was given by a family member to a commissioner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=1525)|
| 0:25:32| and I have looked at the information related to the Ethics Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=1532)|
| 0:25:38| It's interesting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=1538)|
| 0:25:42| I do have a legal background which may serve in this capacity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=1542)|
| 0:25:46| And, again, but my overriding interest is to serve the county in a capacity that I have not in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=1546)|
| 0:25:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=1554)|
| 0:25:56| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=1556)|
| 0:25:57| Likewise, I think a fairly simple question is what do you view the role of the Knox County Ethics Committee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=1557)|
| 0:26:08| Well, to be candid, I don't know a lot about the committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=1568)|
| 0:26:11| Other than what's online and available, I guess my role is to field the issues that come before the committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=1571)|
| 0:26:21| I believe the chair probably will provide a lot of direction as far as that goes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=1581)|
| 0:26:28| I would lend myself in any way that I could, offering my experience both professionally and as a small business person,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=1588)|
| 0:26:43| and rely on my integrity and offer that in whatever way that I could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=1603)|
| 0:26:53| Any other questions, Mr. Cook or Mr. Cooper?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=1613)|
| 0:26:57| Thank you, Mr. Cooper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=1617)|
| 0:26:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=1618)|
| 0:27:01| And, Mr. Brown, do you see it still here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=1621)|
| 0:27:05| Do you want to come forward, Mr. Brown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=1625)|
| 0:27:09| Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=1629)|
| 0:27:10| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=1630)|
| 0:27:11| Is it a requirement that the candidates come and appear before us for questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=1631)|
| 0:27:17| I don't think that it is a requirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=1637)|
| 0:27:19| We have talked about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=1639)|
| 0:27:20| It's just some preference on commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=1640)|
| 0:27:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=1641)|
| 0:27:25| Hi, my name is Anthony Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=1645)|
| 0:27:27| I was nominated for a position on the Ethics Committee, and I would like to be considered for that position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=1647)|
| 0:27:33| The reason I care about this position is I have been coming several years to a lot of the meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=1653)|
| 0:27:39| because I care about Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=1659)|
| 0:27:41| And it just so happens that my family actually came here before Knoxville was a city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=1661)|
| 0:27:48| And Tennessee wasn't even a state yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=1668)|
| 0:27:50| So I really, really love this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=1670)|
| 0:27:52| And I think we all have to consider what we each can do within our realm of expertise to make it better,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=1672)|
| 0:28:00| to give back to the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=1680)|
| 0:28:02| So that's why I like to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=1682)|
| 0:28:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=1684)|
| 0:28:05| Anybody have any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=1685)|
| 0:28:08| A similar question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=1688)|
| 0:28:09| What do you feel the role of the Knox County Ethics Committee is at this point?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=1689)|
| 0:28:15| Well, the role of the Ethics Committee would be, like the other guy said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=1695)|
| 0:28:18| according to a chair would lead us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=1698)|
| 0:28:21| But you have documentation on what the position and the role is on the Ethics Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=1701)|
| 0:28:26| And we're not the police.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=1706)|
| 0:28:27| It's just if ethical questions come up and they need to be discussed, then they will call a meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=1707)|
| 0:28:32| Some months you may not have a meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=1712)|
| 0:28:35| And if they come up, we will be poised to discuss the situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=1715)|
| 0:28:42| Maybe because it concerns ethics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=1722)|
| 0:28:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=1724)|
| 0:28:45| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=1725)|
| 0:28:46| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=1726)|
| 0:28:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=1727)|
| 0:28:48| Thank you, sir, Mr. Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=1728)|
| 0:28:51| Mr. McCook in the room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=1731)|
| 0:28:54| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=1734)|
| 0:28:55| So we have three nominations presently, Brown, Cooper, and McCook.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=1735)|
| 0:29:00| We'll start in the first district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=1740)|
| 0:29:01| If one, if we don't get six, at least we'll fall off and we'll have another round of votes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=1741)|
| 0:29:11| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=1751)|
| 0:29:14| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=1754)|
| 0:29:15| And I'd just like to couch it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=1755)|
| 0:29:17| I think we had a great candidate that kind of fell off because of roles| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=1757)|
| 0:29:23| and responsibilities of the Ethics Committee, and that's unfortunate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=1763)|
| 0:29:28| But with that said, I'll nominate Mr. Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=1768)|
| 0:29:34| Nominator, we're voting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=1774)|
| 0:29:36| We've got the three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=1776)|
| 0:29:37| Oh, we're voting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=1777)|
| 0:29:38| I think a point of order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=1778)|
| 0:29:39| We probably need to take those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=1779)|
| 0:29:41| He opened up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=1781)|
| 0:29:42| We had a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=1782)|
| 0:29:43| We probably need to take a vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=1783)|
| 0:29:44| Did we take a vote for that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=1784)|
| 0:29:45| We didn't ratify the three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=1785)|
| 0:29:47| We have a first and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=1787)|
| 0:29:48| All in favor of opening the nomination, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=1788)|
| 0:29:51| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=1791)|
| 0:29:52| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=1792)|
| 0:29:53| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=1793)|
| 0:29:54| And I need a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=1794)|
| 0:29:56| My vote, then, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=1796)|
| 0:29:58| We need a motion to have three names in the nomination, Anthony Brown, Jonathan Cooper, and John McCook.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=1798)|
| 0:30:03| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=1803)|
| 0:30:04| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=1804)|
| 0:30:05| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=1805)|
| 0:30:06| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=1806)|
| 0:30:07| All in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=1807)|
| 0:30:09| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=1809)|
| 0:30:10| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=1810)|
| 0:30:11| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=1811)|
| 0:30:12| Now we're voting on the candidates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=1812)|
| 0:30:14| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=1814)|
| 0:30:15| Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=1815)|
| 0:30:16| Commissioner McKenzie votes for Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=1816)|
| 0:30:20| Commissioner Burroughs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=1820)|
| 0:30:21| Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=1821)|
| 0:30:22| Commissioner Burroughs votes for Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=1822)|
| 0:30:25| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=1825)|
| 0:30:27| Pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=1827)|

| 0:52:26| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=3146)|
| 0:52:30| The thing that I look around the room and wonder what we might get to a better state on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=3150)|
| 0:52:39| the attendance of these meetings, I believe I made the statement that I would like to hear people discuss| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=3159)|
| 0:52:49| where we are and where we're going and why we're doing it in a different way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=3169)|
| 0:52:53| And I said I would probably cast my vote based on the expense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=3173)|
| 0:52:58| And if we meet in the evening at 5, we have a considerable amount of staff that supports us in these meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=3178)|
| 0:53:07| that will have to be treated with a policy which may end up costing the county money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=3187)|
| 0:53:16| Also, just in the basic getting in and out of the building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=3196)|
| 0:53:23| PBA will be required to provide us more support in the entering and leaving the building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=3203)|
| 0:53:32| because our meetings on those couple of nights a week, couple of nights a month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=3212)|
| 0:53:38| will be passed what they might normally staff at a lower level,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=3218)|
| 0:53:43| but we'd be staffing at a higher level when we have our meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=3223)|
| 0:53:50| And then there is one other thing to consider, and in particular today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=3230)|
| 0:53:57| It's not money. It's weather.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=3237)|
| 0:54:00| The weather is a little unpredictable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=3240)|
| 0:54:03| And I believe my comment way back when was not only when we got down to discussing this would it be dark at 5 o'clock,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=3243)|
| 0:54:11| it would be cold and dark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=3251)|
| 0:54:13| And today the weather outside may have even precluded people from attending this meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=3253)|
| 0:54:21| So I believe that the expense, the support of staff, and the hour of the day will still dictate that I vote no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=3261)|
| 0:54:38| Dr. Brawls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=3278)|
| 0:54:44| When I started reading through this and looking for any supporting documentation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=3284)|
| 0:54:50| there were two things that concerned me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=3290)|
| 0:54:52| One was that this only applied to our legislative session and not to our work session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=3292)|
| 0:54:58| And traditionally our work session has been where we try to do the most discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=3298)|
| 0:55:03| and pass along the most information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=3303)|
| 0:55:06| So if we're looking for getting more people involved and more information and more participation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=3306)|
| 0:55:12| then it would make sense to me that our work session would need to be shifted as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=3312)|
| 0:55:17| And I don't see that addressed in here anywhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=3317)|
| 0:55:20| Also, we also have a lot of holidays that fall on Monday where a commission meets on the following Tuesday instead of on Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=3320)|
| 0:55:31| And that works for us now because we meet in the afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=3331)|
| 0:55:35| City Council is often meeting on those Tuesday evenings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=3335)|
| 0:55:39| And I don't see anything in here either where that's addressed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=3339)|
| 0:55:42| where if we switch to a Tuesday night and that's in conflict with City Council, what does that mean?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=3342)|
| 0:55:49| Do we need to find another date to meet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=3349)|
| 0:55:52| We certainly do not take precedence over City Council meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=3352)|
| 0:55:56| And I don't see that addressed in here anywhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=3356)|
| 0:55:59| So those are two issues that I would need addressed before I would feel comfortable supporting this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=3359)|
| 0:56:07| And all of us would like to see more participation in county government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=3367)|
| 0:56:11| We would all like to see more people at these meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=3371)|
| 0:56:14| And it's really easy to think, well, if we change our meeting time, we're going to have more people coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=3374)|
| 0:56:18| But I think when we look deeper at this issue, we're perhaps not asking the right questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=3378)|
| 0:56:26| And one of them is who does this help and who does this not help or even who does this hurt?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=3386)|
| 0:56:34| Right now, having our meetings as they stand makes it possible for a lot of senior citizens to attend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=3394)|
| 0:56:44| Whereas in the evenings, and as Dave mentioned, especially when the weather is bad and it's dark outside,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=3404)|
| 0:56:50| a lot of our seniors will choose to stay home rather than coming out to a meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=3410)|
| 0:56:58| Right now, with our meetings where they are in the afternoon,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=3418)|
| 0:57:03| it actually makes it possible for more of our low-income residents, especially temp workers or shift workers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=3423)|
| 0:57:14| can more easily come to a meeting in the afternoon than they can to a meeting in the evening,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=3434)|
| 0:57:19| if they're working second or third shift.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=3439)|
| 0:57:22| If you live in a neighborhood that's economically disadvantaged and you don't have access to a car,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=3442)|
| 0:57:30| which a lot of residents in those areas don't and they rely on public transportation, once the sun goes down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=3450)|
| 0:57:37| you don't step foot outside your apartment until the sun comes up the next day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=3457)|
| 0:57:42| And you're certainly not going to stand at a bus stop on the corner in those neighborhoods,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=3462)|
| 0:57:49| waiting for public transportation to take you downtown to a meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=3469)|
| 0:57:54| Women who are in management or are salaried professionals actually would find it easier, in my experience,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=3474)|
| 0:58:05| and the women that I've talked to, find it easier to take an hour or two off to come to a meeting at 2 or 3 o'clock in the afternoon| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=3485)|
| 0:58:15| than to come to a meeting later in the evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=3495)|
| 0:58:18| Because once you, and research has shown this again and again and again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=3498)|
| 0:58:23| that even in dual-income households, women still are responsible for the majority of housework and child rearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=3503)|
| 0:58:32| And once you pick up your child from aftercare at 5.30 and you get home and you supervise the end of homework| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=3512)|
| 0:58:39| and you serve, prepare and serve dinner and then you start the whole bath time and bedtime routine,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=3519)|
| 0:58:45| you're not going to get back out again for a meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=3525)|
| 0:58:48| And even if you had access to child care, you're still going to be too tired to get back out for a meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=3528)|
| 0:58:54| So right now, the situation we have works for the majority of working mothers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=3534)|
| 0:59:01| I also think we need to think seriously about our county employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=3541)|
| 0:59:08| County employees, with the exception of a limited number, they are not the commission employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=3548)|
| 0:59:14| They are the mayor's employees and ultimately the taxpayers' employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=3554)|
| 0:59:22| And I don't think we are giving them due consideration about what we're asking them to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=3562)|
| 0:59:33| Also, our county employees are also residents and taxpayers of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=3573)|
| 0:59:39| And I think we need to fairly and seriously consider their schedules and their time with their families| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=3579)|
| 0:59:49| before we ask them to stay over one, possibly two Monday nights a month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=3589)|
| 0:59:58| When the current situation works out just fine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=3598)|
| 1:00:03| and we don't have to impinge on their personal or family time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=3603)|
| 1:00:11| And again, they are not commission employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=3611)|
| 1:00:13| We're asking somebody else's employees to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=3613)|
| 1:00:18| And it's not just department heads and people like that that we need to be in our meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=3618)|
| 1:00:24| but also, as Dave mentioned, PBA and security, law department employees that need to be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=3624)|
| 1:00:34| So I think that we need to give them fair consideration as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=3634)|
| 1:00:41| So when you ask what demographic does it look like we're helping,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=3641)|
| 1:00:46| I'm not really sure which demographic it is that we're helping by moving these meetings to these times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=3646)|
| 1:00:54| But I can tell you the demographics that it looks like we're hurting are women, low-income shift workers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=3654)|
| 1:01:04| who rely on public transportation, our senior citizens, and our county employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=3664)|
| 1:01:11| So on the face of it, it looks great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=3671)|
| 1:01:13| It looks like a great strategy to get more people involved and more people coming to our meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=3673)|
| 1:01:17| But I think once you start looking below the surface, it really turns out that that's not the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=3677)|
| 1:01:24| And again, even if I did think that wasn't the case and I did think this was a good idea,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=3684)|
| 1:01:30| I still could not vote in favor of it until all the details are ironed out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=3690)|
| 1:01:36| such as what are we going to do about work session| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=3696)|
| 1:01:38| and what are we going to do about those Tuesday nights that we would have to switch our meeting times| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=3698)|
| 1:01:44| if we have a holiday on Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=3704)|
| 1:01:47| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=3707)|
| 1:01:48| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=3708)|
| 1:01:50| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=3710)|
| 1:01:53| Try this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=3713)|
| 1:01:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=3714)|
| 1:01:55| So, you know, we spend a lot of time on this issue, and I definitely don't want to belabor the point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=3715)|
| 1:02:02| but I do want to kind of address a few things, and I guess from a different perspective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=3722)|
| 1:02:08| And that is, you know, as we talk about, you know, the county employees and working, I think we're paying the cost now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=3728)|
| 1:02:17| Our county employees, if we didn't have this meeting, they would be working.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=3737)|
| 1:02:23| It's not like they would just be sitting around twiddling their thumbs, picking up a check.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=3743)|
| 1:02:27| They have work to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=3747)|
| 1:02:29| They stop what they're doing to come here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=3749)|
| 1:02:31| They have valuable work to do that is enhancing the lives of the taxpayers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=3751)|
| 1:02:36| So I just want to make sure that we understand we're taking them from their body of work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=3756)|
| 1:02:41| and a lot of time pushing them down here to sit for some very productive hours where they're actually interacting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=3761)|
| 1:02:48| be it roads or engineering or finance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=3768)|
| 1:02:51| They're interacting with their staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=3771)|
| 1:02:53| So, to me, it's a hindrance to pull them away from their team twice a month from this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=3773)|
| 1:02:58| This way, we take the leadership and the staff that reports to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=3778)|
| 1:03:02| There's a cost there, but I think that's fairly minimal, and I think it's worth the effort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=3782)|
| 1:03:08| You know, and we talk about building costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=3788)|
| 1:03:11| I don't see the building costs really being an issue in terms of volume.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=3791)|
| 1:03:17| And then I guess I'll respond to, you know, when I look in the room, I guess I take a different, I ask, who's not here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=3797)|
| 1:03:24| Who could be here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=3804)|
| 1:03:27| I don't, I didn't, I've lived here my whole life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=3807)|
| 1:03:30| I don't see Knoxville, Knox County, as a war-torn, crime-infested area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=3810)|
| 1:03:34| I think folks are perfectly comfortable within my district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=3814)|
| 1:03:37| I don't catch in the bus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=3817)|
| 1:03:38| I look on Magnolia and the buses, 31 and 19.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=3818)|
| 1:03:43| I see folks on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=3823)|
| 1:03:44| It runs late into the night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=3824)|
| 1:03:46| I think it's a viable option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=3826)|
| 1:03:50| But I think the people that are caring about issues associated with accounting are primarily first-shift working people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=3830)|
| 1:04:00| And I just think we'll see an increase in that, in those numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=3840)|
| 1:04:05| So I do think, I agree with Commissioner Burroughs in that I think we need to probably have an amendment to move the work session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=3845)|
| 1:04:15| I mean, if that's, I'm not going to make that, but if that's what the body would like to do, we can do that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=3855)|
| 1:04:20| or we can do it on a separate resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=3860)|
| 1:04:25| But I do think that's something, and I thought we had addressed that in the Rules Committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=3865)|
| 1:04:30| but I'm guessing we didn't, so thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=3870)|
| 1:04:34| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=3874)|
| 1:04:37| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=3877)|
| 1:04:39| As an old saying goes, if it ain't broke, don't fix it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=3879)|
| 1:04:43| We tried this once before, and it didn't work, so we came back to our current schedule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=3883)|
| 1:04:50| As has been pointed out by Commissioner Wright and also Commissioner Burroughs about some of the extra costs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=3890)|
| 1:04:55| you can see five ladies right here, six, excuse me, six right here in this room up here that are going to be held over time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=3895)|
| 1:05:07| Last month at this meeting, we had three people in the audience who were not either a county employee, press, or schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=3907)|
| 1:05:17| Now, take away the UT students over here today, there's probably not three today, maybe four,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=3917)|
| 1:05:25| which is very typical any time you want to look at our legislative session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=3925)|
| 1:05:32| The session we have at 5 o'clock for zonings is good because it does it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=3932)|
| 1:05:36| Those are the contentious ones for the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=3936)|
| 1:05:41| Those are the ones that people want to come and speak about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=3941)|
| 1:05:44| When is the last time we heard somebody speak about an issue that we have during legislative session?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=3944)|
| 1:05:52| Very seldom, very seldom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=3952)|
| 1:05:55| But almost every time that there is a controversial issue on zonings, we have numerous people here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=3955)|
| 1:06:02| Sometimes we fill three-fourths of this room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=3962)|
| 1:06:06| So do we want to hold them here until midnight on a contentious zoning matter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=3966)|
| 1:06:14| which most of you have seen some of these zoning matters go over two hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=3974)|
| 1:06:19| It can happen and does happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=3979)|
| 1:06:22| So where is that going to put us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=3982)|
| 1:06:25| Again, if it's not broke, don't fix it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=3985)|
| 1:06:28| We have county employees out here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=3988)|
| 1:06:32| Sam said, you know, they're taking time from their job that they could be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=3992)|
| 1:06:35| This is their job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=3995)|
| 1:06:36| This is part of their job to be here to support this cast of people up here who are making decisions for the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=3996)|
| 1:06:43| As far as I'm concerned, they're doing their job right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=4003)|
| 1:06:46| because with the information they gather here, they can go back and do their jobs better also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=4006)|
| 1:06:52| So I'd like to make a substitute motion that we leave the times the way they are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=4012)|
| 1:07:03| Why not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=4023)|
| 1:07:06| That legal, Mr. Law Director, to make a substitute motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=4026)|
| 1:07:09| Well, if it does, you go back to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=4029)|
| 1:07:11| It stays the same anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=4031)|
| 1:07:14| So a negative vote for this would be keeping status quo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=4034)|
| 1:07:21| Well, we can preclude a lot of the extraneous verbose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=4041)|
| 1:07:27| Is there a second for his motion, for his substitute motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=4047)|
| 1:07:34| All right, it dies without a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=4054)|
| 1:07:35| We'll get back to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=4055)|
| 1:07:37| Commissioner Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=4057)|
| 1:07:38| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=4058)|
| 1:07:40| I'll be brief, but a couple of things come to mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=4060)|
| 1:07:43| Every place I've been since this was first brought up, I could go either way on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=4063)|
| 1:07:48| It really personally doesn't make any difference, but that's not a factor really.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=4068)|
| 1:07:54| I made an effort to talk to everybody when I was out in the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=4074)|
| 1:07:58| and ask them the question what their thoughts were.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=4078)|
| 1:08:02| And I appreciate, you know, all the employees we're talking about and the PBA and everybody,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=4082)|
| 1:08:08| but they all work for the citizens just as we all represent the citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=4088)|
| 1:08:13| In fact, I don't think anybody said keep it as it was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=4093)|
| 1:08:19| Everybody stressed they'd rather see it later in the day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=4099)|
| 1:08:23| That's just my own little survey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=4103)|
| 1:08:27| Second of all, you know, anybody, no matter what their age is, senior citizen, young person,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=4107)|
| 1:08:32| UT student, whatever, can watch this on TV.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=4112)|
| 1:08:35| So unless you want to speak, there's really no reason necessarily to come here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=4115)|
| 1:08:41| But if you are coming here to speak or have an influence on a vote, if you work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=4121)|
| 1:08:48| it's difficult to come during the day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=4128)|
| 1:08:50| I appreciate what others have said about you've done it in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=4130)|
| 1:08:53| I was not here in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=4133)|
| 1:08:55| But this is a presence, and this is what people are telling me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=4135)|
| 1:09:01| Third of all, if we don't do anything, I would like to at least make some sort of commitment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=4141)|
| 1:09:06| that on items that have a lot of concern by our citizens,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=4146)|
| 1:09:12| that we do make sure it's as late as possible in the agenda so that they possibly can come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=4152)|
| 1:09:18| It would be more convenient.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=4158)|
| 1:09:19| We always do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=4159)|
| 1:09:20| We have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=4160)|
| 1:09:21| We always do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=4161)|
| 1:09:22| What we've done in the past, Commissioner Thomas, is if there is something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=4162)|
| 1:09:26| we'll hold it until the 430-ish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=4166)|
| 1:09:28| We'll suspend our meeting until 430, right before zonings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=4168)|
| 1:09:32| and let the people, the last time it was teachers, so they could get out of school and get here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=4172)|
| 1:09:37| Commissioner Olinby.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=4177)|
| 1:09:39| Thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=4179)|
| 1:09:42| Yeah, I was going to say that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=4182)|
| 1:09:43| We did that for Carter Elementary, too, when we were doing that whole debate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=4183)|
| 1:09:46| We moved it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=4186)|
| 1:09:47| We suspended or adjourned ours and then came back into session for that later on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=4187)|
| 1:09:53| We've made accommodations in the past, and I don't see that changing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=4193)|
| 1:09:59| I actually sat on the Rules Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=4199)|
| 1:10:00| I voted to approve the change,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=4200)|
| 1:10:05| and then I've been inundated with a lot of phone calls in my district from people saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=4205)|
| 1:10:11| don't change it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=4211)|
| 1:10:12| Why do you want to change it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=4212)|
| 1:10:15| And I've done the same as you, Mr. Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=4215)|
| 1:10:17| Every time I go to a meeting, I ask them, would you rather see it at this time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=4217)|
| 1:10:21| Some say, yeah, we'd like to see it later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=4221)|
| 1:10:23| The majority of them have said, no, just leave it the way it is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=4223)|
| 1:10:28| because if they want to see it, they'll watch it on TV unless it's something important,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=4228)|
| 1:10:32| and then they'll make a way to be down here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=4232)|
| 1:10:37| I'm not going to support to change the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=4237)|
| 1:10:42| I have changed my mind over the last two months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=4242)|
| 1:10:44| It's just a lot of people have contacted me about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=4244)|
| 1:10:50| Commissioner Brown said, if it ain't broke, don't fix it, and we have tried it before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=4250)|
| 1:10:55| Two years ago, I voted to move the time, and I was not on the prevailing side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=4255)|
| 1:11:03| So I'm not going to support it at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=4263)|
| 1:11:09| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=4269)|
| 1:11:15| There's very seldom a time that one person can come and speak before all 11 of us commissioners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=4275)|
| 1:11:21| and that is at our public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=4281)|
| 1:11:23| And when we hold it at 145 during the day, I think we lock out the majority of the people that we represent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=4283)|
| 1:11:30| You look at all the surrounding counties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=4290)|
| 1:11:32| You look at the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=4292)|
| 1:11:34| You look at the Board of Education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=4294)|
| 1:11:36| They hold their meetings later in the day where the people they represent can be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=4296)|
| 1:11:40| Now, will it increase people coming?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=4300)|
| 1:11:42| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=4302)|
| 1:11:44| It's about the opportunity to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=4304)|
| 1:11:46| I think the government should be accountable, transparent, and accessible,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=4306)|
| 1:11:51| and I think we make our government a little more accessible by moving the meetings later in the day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=4311)|
| 1:11:58| Commissioner Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=4318)|
| 1:12:02| My point on this is we're here by the will of the people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=4322)|
| 1:12:07| and we've got to find out what the will of the people is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=4327)|
| 1:12:11| I got to talk to about 100 people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=4331)|
| 1:12:14| Forty-five of them said it didn't make a difference, they wanted to leave it like it was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=4334)|
| 1:12:18| Those were retirees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=4338)|
| 1:12:20| The 50 people that said they'd like to have it are people that work during the day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=4340)|
| 1:12:25| So you've got a split there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=4345)|
| 1:12:27| You've got people that are retired, doesn't make a difference, they can be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=4347)|
| 1:12:31| But the people that work said they'd like to be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=4351)|
| 1:12:34| Now, will that cause a lot of people to be here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=4354)|
| 1:12:36| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=4356)|
| 1:12:37| There's a lot of apathy out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=4357)|
| 1:12:39| Most of the people that I asked, of those 95 people I asked, they didn't even know what time we met now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=4359)|
| 1:12:46| So how do we encourage them to take part in the government, and how do we get them enthused to be here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=4366)|
| 1:12:53| Changing the time may help, but we've got to do something to make them get here to participate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=4373)|
| 1:13:00| And so we've got to think of ways of trying to do things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=4380)|
| 1:13:03| So this could be a way, and again, it could be a bad mistake to vote to change the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=4383)|
| 1:13:08| We just have to see what we can do to get the people involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=4388)|
| 1:13:13| Chris, if you would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=4393)|
| 1:13:14| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=4394)|
| 1:13:16| Chris Garwood, Frontier Main Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=4396)|
| 1:13:19| I'm not going to weigh in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=4399)|
| 1:13:20| I'm going to give you all some facts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=4400)|
| 1:13:22| There is a budgetary impact on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=4402)|
| 1:13:26| One would be from our budget that we get from PBA on the security out front.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=4406)|
| 1:13:30| So I'm not saying it's a major amount of money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=4410)|
| 1:13:33| but there will be an increase there on top of what's already been approved in the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=4413)|
| 1:13:37| We do have that to consider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=4417)|
| 1:13:39| And then somebody mentioned the six ladies up there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=4419)|
| 1:13:45| Whether they're exempt or non-exempt employees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=4425)|
| 1:13:48| that's going to have an impact on whether we have to pay them overtime or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=4428)|
| 1:13:53| And so there is a budgetary impact on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=4433)|
| 1:13:56| I don't have a number in my head.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=4436)|
| 1:13:58| I don't know that number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=4438)|
| 1:14:00| But I just wanted you to be aware that, yes, there is a budgetary impact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=4440)|
| 1:14:04| I'm not saying we have to amend our adopted budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=4444)|
| 1:14:07| but we'd have to watch it to make sure that there's nothing that we couldn't cover.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=4447)|
| 1:14:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=4451)|
| 1:14:16| One other thing I forgot to mention that I meant to is also,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=4456)|
| 1:14:20| how is this going to impact our chairman's luncheon and our schedule for the rest of the day?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=4460)|
| 1:14:24| Will we stop having chairman luncheons?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=4464)|
| 1:14:28| And I think that's a shame, too, because that's invaluable time that we spend together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=4468)|
| 1:14:33| learning more about issues and some really good discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=4473)|
| 1:14:37| and learning about things that we don't always have time for during our work session and legislative session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=4477)|
| 1:14:44| So I'm sorry to see that happen, for sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=4484)|
| 1:14:48| And one thing that I think this commission has always done well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=4488)|
| 1:14:54| that I've always bragged about this commission on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=4494)|
| 1:14:57| and there are other areas where we may have problems,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=4497)|
| 1:15:00| but one thing that I think this commission has done remarkably well over the years that I've been on it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=4500)|
| 1:15:06| is provide opportunities for citizens to come speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=4506)|
| 1:15:12| We do a better job of public forum, I think, than any other body in the city or the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=4512)|
| 1:15:19| And we don't just have public forum at 145.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=4519)|
| 1:15:24| We can do it before zonings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=4524)|
| 1:15:27| We can do it after zonings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=4527)|
| 1:15:28| We can do it at any point during the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=4528)|
| 1:15:31| We always give people the option if they're here to speak about a particular issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=4531)|
| 1:15:34| do you want to speak at the regular scheduled public forum| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=4534)|
| 1:15:38| or do you want to speak when that issue comes up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=4538)|
| 1:15:41| You know, we will let people speak at any time that they want to speak during the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=4541)|
| 1:15:46| We do that so well, and it's something I'm really proud of us for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=4546)|
| 1:15:51| So I don't think anybody can argue that the schedule we have now is excessively limiting for anyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=4551)|
| 1:15:59| Anyone can show up at any time that we're in session| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=4559)|
| 1:16:02| and speak to us on any issue that they want to speak to us on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=4562)|
| 1:16:06| That's something that we do really, really well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=4566)|
| 1:16:08| So I don't want us to forget about that either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=4568)|
| 1:16:11| I also have a problem with the zoning, with the way this is stated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=4571)|
| 1:16:17| saying that 7 p.m. or immediately following the legislative session for zonings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=4577)|
| 1:16:21| I have a problem with that because we publish our zoning agenda saying that that meeting starts at 7 p.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=4581)|
| 1:16:28| and people who aren't here for the legislative session but are only coming for zonings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=4588)|
| 1:16:33| are going to be here at 7 o'clock expecting a zonings meeting to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=4593)|
| 1:16:38| And if they have to sit through an hour, 30 minutes, an hour and a half of commission work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=4598)|
| 1:16:45| before we get to that zoning, that's going to make for some really unhappy people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=4605)|
| 1:16:49| So I think that's another detail that has been overlooked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=4609)|
| 1:16:54| that really should be straightened out before we move forward on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=4614)|
| 1:16:58| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=4618)|
| 1:16:59| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=4619)|
| 1:17:01| A lot of different things have been said, and let me expand a little bit on the public forum bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=4621)|
| 1:17:06| Up until recently, if you can go back and pull out one of last year's agendas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=4626)|
| 1:17:12| you probably would see public forum on there at least three, maybe four times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=4632)|
| 1:17:18| We had it before during the honorariums.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=4638)|
| 1:17:22| We had it before the commission started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=4642)|
| 1:17:24| We had it after the commission was over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=4644)|
| 1:17:27| We had it before zonings began.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=4647)|
| 1:17:29| So that really is not an issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=4649)|
| 1:17:34| And if anybody who works or whatever is dead set on watching this group argue like we are right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=4654)|
| 1:17:42| debate about things we are right now, they can see it multiple times during the month on public television.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=4662)|
| 1:17:50| Now, also, if I had an issue, I don't care if I worked in Kalamazoo,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=4670)|
| 1:17:56| if I had an issue that was going to be before this board that I felt strongly and needed to say something about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=4676)|
| 1:18:03| I would make a way to be here to say it at that point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=4683)|
| 1:18:06| and I guarantee you that 99% of John Q. Public will do the same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=4686)|
| 1:18:11| As I mentioned earlier, 99.9% of those all come during zonings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=4691)|
| 1:18:20| Somebody mentioned about, you know, having to work during the day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=4700)|
| 1:18:25| If they were off during the day, they'd probably stay home and watch it on TV anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=4705)|
| 1:18:30| They have to come downtown and park, pay to park, come over here, depending on the weather, whatever have you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=4710)|
| 1:18:36| So, again, if it ain't broke, let's don't fix it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=4716)|
| 1:18:41| Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=4721)|
| 1:18:42| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=4722)|
| 1:18:44| One of the points that we've probably missed out on that I need to recognize,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=4724)|
| 1:18:48| the Board of Education has several people come to our meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=4728)|
| 1:18:52| It may not be four or five of them here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=4732)|
| 1:18:55| but they at least have staff across the street that they can get any question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=4735)|
| 1:18:59| or begin to look at any question we might have for them if we're meeting during the day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=4739)|
| 1:19:05| and we have an important question to the Board of Education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=4745)|
| 1:19:10| And I must admit that I took a personal aside here with the law director and asked him this personal question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=4750)|
| 1:19:22| He's going to make a face at me because it was kind of in jest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=4762)|
| 1:19:26| Was there anything on today's agenda that brought anybody downtown to listen to what we're,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=4766)|
| 1:19:34| as Commissioner Brown is saying, what we're discussing right now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=4774)|
| 1:19:38| The issues or items that were on County Commission's agenda today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=4778)|
| 1:19:43| really are making sure that we look out for the citizens of Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=4783)|
| 1:19:47| and that I don't know that anyone has missed contributing today because we were not after 5 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=4787)|
| 1:19:59| Schools also start at 5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=4799)|
| 1:20:02| So continuing on, I have two other things I want to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=4802)|
| 1:20:06| We've mentioned TV several times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=4806)|
| 1:20:09| One of the direct complaints that I had was that, well, the person admitted they watched us on TV.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=4809)|
| 1:20:22| After some questioning, you know, I said, I don't see you at commission meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=4822)|
| 1:20:28| They wanted to say they had interest in commission, but I said, you're not there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=4828)|
| 1:20:34| I'm watching you on TV.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=4834)|
| 1:20:37| Well, if we move this to evenings, I said, what are you going to do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=4837)|
| 1:20:40| He says, I'm not going to watch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=4840)|
| 1:20:42| You're not going to knock me out of prime time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=4842)|
| 1:20:46| And then the last thing, Commissioner Brown, you apologized to some UT students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=4846)|
| 1:20:52| I didn't apologize to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=4852)|
| 1:20:55| I don't know if they're not paying attention right at the moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=4855)|
| 1:20:58| Maybe they are UT students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=4858)|
| 1:21:00| I think they're journalism.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=4860)|
| 1:21:02| They are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=4862)|
| 1:21:05| They were here last month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=4865)|
| 1:21:07| Yeah, but they're hard press.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=4867)|
| 1:21:09| They're not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=4869)|
| 1:21:10| Yeah, they're hard press.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=4870)|
| 1:21:13| Commissioner Brantley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=4873)|
| 1:21:16| Just briefly, you know, some of the arguments, and I appreciate our vice position,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=4876)|
| 1:21:21| and it doesn't look like this is going to pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=4881)|
| 1:21:24| This is one of the things that I talk to a lot of people about when running for this office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=4884)|
| 1:21:29| However, I do think the argument that city council and the school board meet at night,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=4889)|
| 1:21:37| again, I think that's just one more reason why we should be doing the same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=4897)|
| 1:21:42| It just kind of puts all these governments on the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=4902)|
| 1:21:45| And keep in mind, they have to face the same issues that you're arguing about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=4905)|
| 1:21:49| the same things with employees, the same things with the PBA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=4909)|
| 1:21:53| Security has to be here for their meetings also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=4913)|
| 1:21:56| But isn't it a public building?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=4916)|
| 1:21:58| Isn't that what it's for?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=4918)|
| 1:22:00| And I only say that we are here for the voter, for the residents of Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=4920)|
| 1:22:08| for the people we work for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=4928)|
| 1:22:10| That's why we're here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=4930)|
| 1:22:11| And we should be as convenient for them as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=4931)|
| 1:22:14| And if it's a daytime, fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=4934)|
| 1:22:16| It's not a problem with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=4936)|
| 1:22:17| It's really better for me in the daytime as it is with most of you because you're retired.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=4937)|
| 1:22:21| But for people who have to work, for instance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=4941)|
| 1:22:23| we're going to be talking about the ethics committee probably here in a few minutes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=4943)|
| 1:22:27| and I'll bet you anything, determining how many e-mails I've gotten this week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=4947)|
| 1:22:32| that if it was at a time when school teachers could be here today, they would be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=4952)|
| 1:22:36| But they can't because we're meeting while they're in school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=4956)|
| 1:22:39| Just a point to think about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=4959)|
| 1:22:42| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=4962)|
| 1:22:44| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=4964)|
| 1:22:46| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=4966)|
| 1:22:50| Looking at our work session meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=4970)|
| 1:22:53| could we move our work session meetings later in the day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=4973)|
| 1:22:56| and follow them with zoning at 5 o'clock on work session Mondays?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=4976)|
| 1:23:01| Well, I think has anybody called and checked logistically?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=4981)|
| 1:23:06| My question was going to be at the end of all this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=4986)|
| 1:23:08| Won't work with MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=4988)|
| 1:23:09| Have we called anybody logistically and put this on a calendar| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=4989)|
| 1:23:12| and see what it looked like over the 12 months?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=4992)|
| 1:23:14| I think that's important that we do that, and I don't think we've done that as far as,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=4994)|
| 1:23:18| because MPC and agendas and things like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=4998)|
| 1:23:21| that was going to be my question, was going to be have we placed this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=5001)|
| 1:23:25| looked at it in a 12-month span, what's it going to affect on council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=5005)|
| 1:23:29| what's it going to affect on us, and see if we need to change it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=5009)|
| 1:23:33| what's the best way to change it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=5013)|
| 1:23:35| Because we may enter into this, change our rules today, and go back,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=5015)|
| 1:23:39| and in March we conflict with two other meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=5019)|
| 1:23:42| And so we really, I think logistically, if we haven't placed it on a calendar yet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=5022)|
| 1:23:46| and looked at it over the 12-month period, I think we probably need to at least defer this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=5026)|
| 1:23:50| That would be my opinion, but go ahead, Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=5030)|
| 1:23:53| And is there any possible way that if we had a holiday where we had to move a meeting to Tuesday| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=5033)|
| 1:23:59| that city council could have this room and we could have the small assembly room?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=5039)|
| 1:24:05| You lose your ability to air it publicly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=5045)|
| 1:24:09| There's no cameras in there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=5049)|
| 1:24:11| There's only one channel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=5051)|
| 1:24:13| Yeah, but it would be recorded to be replayed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=5053)|
| 1:24:16| Apparently they're saying most of the people aren't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=5056)|
| 1:24:18| I don't know if you can replay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=5058)|
| 1:24:19| I don't know if there's cameras in there to replay that or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=5059)|
| 1:24:22| I think that's logistical questions we need to ask before we get real hasty in making a decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=5062)|
| 1:24:28| But if we need to change it, I'm not so much into changing it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=5068)|
| 1:24:31| as I am plotting it on a 12-month calendar and see how it affects other meetings and other agendas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=5071)|
| 1:24:37| Chris, did you have something else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=5077)|
| 1:24:43| You all are going back and forth on some issues, and so I'll throw a few things out to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=5083)|
| 1:24:49| I don't disagree with what you're saying from a logistics standpoint to put it on a calendar and calendar it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=5089)|
| 1:24:55| Also, what else you could do is you could maybe push this vote off until we have a budget discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=5095)|
| 1:25:02| I can bring you a budget figure on what it would increase by.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=5102)|
| 1:25:08| It's going to be PBA for the most part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=5108)|
| 1:25:10| I know there's probably four of the six employees at least that are probably non-exempt employees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=5110)|
| 1:25:17| and so the key is from an HR standpoint, can you let them come in late one other day to offset that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=5117)|
| 1:25:23| or do you have to pay them overtime?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=5123)|
| 1:25:25| We'll get into that figure and get an estimate on what that cost could be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=5125)|
| 1:25:29| And then if you decided to go forth around the budget time, which would be May or June,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=5129)|
| 1:25:35| then that's when it's daylight savings time, and so you have a lot for a longer period of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=5135)|
| 1:25:41| And then you could try it for a few months to see if it works and then go from there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=5141)|
| 1:25:45| Just a little thought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=5145)|
| 1:25:47| I mean, that would give you a bigger piece of what the budgetary impact is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=5147)|
| 1:25:53| Commissioner Bussell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=5153)|
| 1:25:54| I want to make a motion that we put this on a calendar, see how it conflicts with other things in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=5154)|
| 1:26:00| Also, I would like to get from Chris a more definitive issue of how much it would cost as far as using this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=5160)|
| 1:26:09| say, at a 5 o'clock meeting time so we'll have more definitive information to make our decision on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=5169)|
| 1:26:16| So your substitute motion would be to send it back to the rules committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=5176)|
| 1:26:22| plotting it out logistically, and then also getting a budgetary impact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=5182)|
| 1:26:27| That's your substitute motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=5187)|
| 1:26:28| That's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=5188)|
| 1:26:29| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=5189)|
| 1:26:31| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=5191)|
| 1:26:32| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=5192)|
| 1:26:33| Commissioner Brawls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=5193)|
| 1:26:34| I'd also like to add that when we send this back to the rules committee that they also address the issue of our work session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=5194)|
| 1:26:42| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=5202)|
| 1:26:43| I think we need to take a total look at the calendar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=5203)|
| 1:26:45| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=5205)|
| 1:26:46| If we're going to change something, let's take a total look at the calendar and do it all over again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=5206)|
| 1:26:48| So that we have a clear picture of what we're losing as well, such as the chairman's luncheon,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=5208)|
| 1:26:52| and if there's some other way that that can be handled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=5212)|
| 1:26:56| Gotcha.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=5216)|
| 1:26:57| Is that acceptable to you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=5217)|
| 1:26:58| That's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=5218)|
| 1:26:59| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=5219)|
| 1:27:00| We have a motion and a second on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=5220)|
| 1:27:01| Any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=5221)|
| 1:27:02| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=5222)|
| 1:27:04| We're going to take a look at it and have them also look at the zoning time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=5224)|
| 1:27:07| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=5227)|
| 1:27:08| Everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=5228)|
| 1:27:09| Everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=5229)|
| 1:27:10| Total.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=5230)|
| 1:27:11| It's up to the rules committee to look at the total impact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=5231)|
| 1:27:12| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=5232)|
| 1:27:13| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=5233)|
| 1:27:14| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=5234)|
| 1:27:15| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=5235)|
| 1:27:16| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=5236)|
| 1:27:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=5237)|
| 1:27:18| Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=5238)|
| 1:27:19| Brown's the only no?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=5239)|
| 1:27:20| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=5240)|
| 1:27:21| Motion passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=5241)|
| 1:27:22| Eight to one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=5242)|
| 1:27:23| Nine to one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=5243)|

| 1:27:26| Page 14, Resolution 906.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=5246)|
| 1:27:34| Resolution ratifying the actions of Knox County Internal Auditor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=5254)|
| 1:27:38| in commencing a performance audit of the Knox County Schools Credit Card Program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=5258)|
| 1:27:42| and in proceeding with the audit in the extent and scope shall be developed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=5262)|
| 1:27:48| by the internal auditor in authorizing the internal auditor to conduct| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=5268)|
| 1:27:52| an audit of the Knox County Schools Purchasing Program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=5272)|
| 1:27:55| and its travel expenditures should she deem it necessary with the extent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=5275)|
| 1:27:59| and scope of such audit to be developed by the internal auditor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=5279)|
| 1:28:03| Resolution 906.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=5283)|
| 1:28:05| I didn't hear you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=5285)|
| 1:28:08| Was there a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=5288)|
| 1:28:09| Move.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=5289)|
| 1:28:10| Approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=5290)|
| 1:28:11| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=5291)|
| 1:28:12| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=5292)|
| 1:28:15| Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=5295)|
| 1:28:16| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=5296)|
| 1:28:20| In line with some discussion that we've been receiving via e-mail| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=5300)|
| 1:28:26| and phone call and whatever, there is one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=5306)|
| 1:28:31| and I have in front of me the resolution, the second,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=5311)|
| 1:28:35| whereas during the course of a duly noticed meeting of the audit committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=5315)|
| 1:28:41| it was recommended that the full commission consider| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=5321)|
| 1:28:45| it was recommended that the full commission consider an internal audit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=5325)|
| 1:28:52| of the Knox County Schools Credit Card Program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=5332)|
| 1:28:57| and I believe we sort of tapered off into, well, we don't know where we went,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=5337)|
| 1:29:04| and we ended up with a, we here have before us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=5344)|
| 1:29:09| we've ended up with our sentence being proceed with an audit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=5349)|
| 1:29:16| the extent and scope shall be determined by the internal auditor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=5356)|
| 1:29:20| Now, some people have interpreted that apparently to mean that we're going to do a shallow audit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=5360)|
| 1:29:29| The recommendation of the audit committee was to have an audit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=5369)|
| 1:29:36| The action of the full commission is now what I'm calling into discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=5376)|
| 1:29:44| So I believe we need, I'm going to stop with my discussion right there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=5384)|
| 1:29:49| and let other people chime in with what they think that particular paragraph means| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=5389)|
| 1:29:55| to the specificity and depth of an audit that would be conducted internally| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=5395)|
| 1:30:03| and then open the door to whether or not people think that internal audit then is going to be sufficient.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=5403)|
| 1:30:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=5409)|
| 1:30:10| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=5410)|
| 1:30:11| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=5411)|
| 1:30:12| I'm going to take just a few minutes and kind of talk to you guys| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=5412)|
| 1:30:14| about the process that we followed with Andrea and I and the law director| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=5414)|
| 1:30:18| and some of the discussion that, you know, I think I even spoke with Chairman McMillan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=5418)|
| 1:30:24| and Ms. Roundtree after their action last month at their school board meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=5424)|
| 1:30:29| and so we were kind of making sure we were all on the same page| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=5429)|
| 1:30:34| and letting everybody be aware of where we're at with the audit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=5434)|
| 1:30:39| A lot of folks are concerned about an internal audit versus an external audit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=5439)|
| 1:30:44| and we were in contact with the external auditor and Mr. McLemore,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=5444)|
| 1:30:49| and we discussed, or it has been discussed, I haven't been part of that discussion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=5449)|
| 1:30:55| but they feel that it would be best done internally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=5455)|
| 1:31:00| They're going to keep an eye on the bottom line, how it affects the budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=5460)|
| 1:31:04| how it affects the financial statements of the county and the school system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=5464)|
| 1:31:11| and also the question of the forensic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=5471)|
| 1:31:15| When we talk about a forensic audit, I think people think that the forensic audit is not being done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=5475)|
| 1:31:21| The forensic audit is being done by the state comptroller's office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=5481)|
| 1:31:24| and so if the external or internal auditor had gone in and found criminal matter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=5484)|
| 1:31:31| they would stop their audit and turn it over to an investigatory jurisdiction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=5491)|
| 1:31:38| and so that was actually started before the internal audit was even done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=5498)|
| 1:31:44| and so the controls audit that internal audit is currently proceeding with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=5504)|
| 1:31:50| is something that looks to prevent, looks at the measures that are in place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=5510)|
| 1:31:54| and looks to prevent these measures from happening again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=5514)|
| 1:31:57| If there is a criminal side or the criminal investigation side,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=5517)|
| 1:32:01| catch me if I'm out of line, is done by somebody outside of an internal or external auditor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=5521)|
| 1:32:07| Those things are being done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=5527)|
| 1:32:09| There's three eyes on this discussion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=5529)|
| 1:32:12| and I think that we're going to make sure that we do exactly what we need to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=5532)|
| 1:32:16| to make sure that hopefully those are being, if there is any wrongdoing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=5536)|
| 1:32:21| those that are held accountable and to prevent it from happening again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=5541)|
| 1:32:24| So I'll go ahead and make that as to kind of where we came up to where we're at,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=5544)|
| 1:32:28| and we'll start with Commissioner Busler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=5548)|
| 1:32:31| If I remember correctly, I was looking at the request we got from the school board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=5551)|
| 1:32:36| and the school board requested by, I guess, Mr. McMillan was an external audit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=5556)|
| 1:32:44| and we kind of changed it here on our board of what he was requesting from us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=5564)|
| 1:32:51| And I was just wondering, I'm new at this, this is my third meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=5571)|
| 1:32:56| but if somebody requests something specifically from us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=5576)|
| 1:33:00| are we not obligated to look at that external audit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=5580)|
| 1:33:04| or do we change it to what we feel is right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=5584)|
| 1:33:07| I mean, if another body comes to us and says, we feel we need this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=5587)|
| 1:33:14| and that was not discussed off of that letter that was sent to us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=5594)|
| 1:33:17| because they were requesting an external audit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=5597)|
| 1:33:21| out beyond the boundaries of Knox County here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=5601)|
| 1:33:26| So I'm just asking, should we not have discussed that a little bit more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=5606)|
| 1:33:31| before we passed what we did pass?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=5611)|
| 1:33:35| Well, I think the external auditor was already aware.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=5615)|
| 1:33:40| And what Andrea had done and has, once she heard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=5620)|
| 1:33:46| the Yellow Book standard requires her, once she sees smoke, that she's to react to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=5626)|
| 1:33:51| And that's exactly what she did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=5631)|
| 1:33:54| It just came to the law director, myself, and the external auditor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=5634)|
| 1:33:57| and started having those discussions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=5637)|
| 1:33:59| And so, again, they asked for an external forensic audit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=5639)|
| 1:34:05| A forensic audit is looking for criminal matters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=5645)|
| 1:34:08| Those things are already being looked at by the state comptroller's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=5648)|
| 1:34:11| At the time, they weren't aware that the comptroller's office was there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=5651)|
| 1:34:15| They were there before we were aware that they were there, which is fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=5655)|
| 1:34:19| And so all of the steps that were taken for this audit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=5659)|
| 1:34:25| were vetted out through three or four people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=5665)|
| 1:34:28| And I spoke with, after I got the letter from Board Member McMillan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=5668)|
| 1:34:34| he and I spoke about it, and we just wanted to, he and I both agreed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=5674)|
| 1:34:38| and Amber and I agree, all the steps need to be taken| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=5678)|
| 1:34:41| to make sure to hold those accountable for actions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=5681)|
| 1:34:43| and to make sure it doesn't happen again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=5683)|
| 1:34:45| That's the concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=5685)|
| 1:34:46| I think that's how we approached the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=5686)|
| 1:34:48| But her, the internal audit standards or auditing standards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=5688)|
| 1:34:53| governmental auditing standards require when there's smoke they need to react,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=5693)|
| 1:34:56| and she did that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=5696)|
| 1:34:57| So that's kind of how that process started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=5697)|
| 1:35:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=5701)|
| 1:35:02| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=5702)|
| 1:35:03| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=5703)|
| 1:35:06| Mr. Wright mentioned earlier there is some misconception with the public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=5706)|
| 1:35:12| about what was actually voted in last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=5712)|
| 1:35:18| They asked for a five-year outside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=5718)|
| 1:35:21| What we did, after a much longer discussion, was authorize,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=5721)|
| 1:35:27| and again, as I said last week and the week before that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=5727)|
| 1:35:30| a month before that, the buck stops here as far as making the final decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=5730)|
| 1:35:35| We authorized a two-year with the authority to go as deep as she needed to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=5735)|
| 1:35:45| We also added in the credit cards and the travel as far as she needs to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=5745)|
| 1:35:53| So she has to move, as Commissioner Anders just pointed out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=5753)|
| 1:36:00| very gingerly in this because you have some criminal investigation going on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=5760)|
| 1:36:10| and our auditor can't or the outside auditor can't interfere with that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=5770)|
| 1:36:17| or do anything that would negate any possible culpability for recovery.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=5777)|
| 1:36:26| So we have to tread lightly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=5786)|
| 1:36:29| and I don't want the public to think that we're pussyfooting around this thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=5789)|
| 1:36:33| and that seems to be the concession.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=5793)|
| 1:36:35| She has the authority, and if you want to get in on this conversation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=5795)|
| 1:36:40| be at the Audit Committee meeting next week on the 25th| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=5800)|
| 1:36:44| because this is going to be discussed again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=5804)|
| 1:36:47| and we will firm up this policy of who's on first, who's on second,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=5807)|
| 1:36:55| so that, as Mr. Elmore from our outside auditor pointed out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=5815)|
| 1:37:00| you know, you don't wait for two months until after something happens| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=5820)|
| 1:37:05| to go start looking to see what happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=5825)|
| 1:37:07| That's a long time to cover up a lot of stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=5827)|
| 1:37:10| If we found out about it today, she needs to be in there tomorrow,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=5830)|
| 1:37:15| and whether it's the Commission chairman or the Audit Committee chairman| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=5835)|
| 1:37:20| or them both or either that gives her the authority to go ahead,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=5840)|
| 1:37:26| then that's what's going to have to be done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=5846)|
| 1:37:29| and that's what we're going to be discussing next week at the Audit Committee meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=5849)|
| 1:37:34| Now, it is kind of a sticky wicket, but Rome wasn't built in a day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=5854)|
| 1:37:43| If you go off half-cocked on something, you only get half the answers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=5863)|
| 1:37:48| So I think we're on the right trail right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=5868)|
| 1:37:52| and I think that the plans are in place to do what we need to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=5872)|
| 1:37:58| and it's not going to be a fluff audit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=5878)|
| 1:38:03| There's talk about the PPU one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=5883)|
| 1:38:07| Well, we've not really had an open discussion on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=5887)|
| 1:38:10| There are figures available,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=5890)|
| 1:38:12| and those are going to be discussed next week at the Audit Committee meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=5892)|
| 1:38:15| So if you're interested in that PPU audit and want to know what was in it, come to the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=5895)|
| 1:38:22| Commissioner Brantley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=5902)|
| 1:38:24| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=5904)|
| 1:38:26| Two things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=5906)|
| 1:38:27| First of all, I believe that we should have addressed at the beginning the request for an outside auditor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=5907)|
| 1:38:34| and that was met by the outside auditor who told members of this commission and our Audit Committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=5914)|
| 1:38:41| that they didn't think it was necessary, or that's what I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=5921)|
| 1:38:45| And I don't think a lot of people have heard that or know that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=5925)|
| 1:38:49| because they think there's some shenanigans going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=5929)|
| 1:38:52| However, I do think we should do one thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=5932)|
| 1:38:55| I believe that this commission should specify exactly what the auditor should be doing and no more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=5935)|
| 1:39:03| And I think this paragraph gives the auditor too much leeway in what they can do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=5943)|
| 1:39:09| That gives an auditor an opportunity to do things that an audit is not supposed to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=5949)|
| 1:39:14| which could be going in areas they don't need to be going in for other reasons| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=5954)|
| 1:39:18| and what we want them to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=5958)|
| 1:39:20| And I think the auditor should only do exactly what we ask them to do and no more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=5960)|
| 1:39:27| and look at one thing at a time and take care of that issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=5967)|
| 1:39:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=5971)|
| 1:39:33| Commissioner Olmey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=5973)|
| 1:39:35| Thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=5975)|
| 1:39:37| I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=5977)|
| 1:39:38| I was at both the Audit Committee meeting and the regular commission last week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=5978)|
| 1:39:44| and what we got from my interpretation from the outside auditor was we're already doing this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=5984)|
| 1:39:52| We're already on top of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=5992)|
| 1:39:54| The comptroller is already doing their criminal investigation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=5994)|
| 1:39:57| The pewing company is doing theirs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=5997)|
| 1:40:01| Andrea was just doing basically a third set of eyes to nail down the processes and everything like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=6001)|
| 1:40:11| I think that we've given her the leeway to go five years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=6011)|
| 1:40:18| I mean, if we need to make it concrete that it's five years we need you to go,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=6018)|
| 1:40:23| the pewing company said that would take her a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=6023)|
| 1:40:27| That's a lot of transactions in five years because you're not talking about the six credit cards here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=6027)|
| 1:40:32| You're talking about the 27 SAMs credit cards, the 232 fuel cards that they have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=6032)|
| 1:40:37| not to mention the travel cards and any other credit cards they may have that has to be looked into.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=6037)|
| 1:40:44| Any PayPal accounts that are out there, we don't know what they have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=6044)|
| 1:40:48| So until she gets in there, I think two years is good with her option to go three more until she uncovers this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=6048)|
| 1:40:58| But the lawyer for the sheriff's office even said you don't want her digging too much because they're doing an investigation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=6058)|
| 1:41:06| and you don't want people stepping on their toes what they need to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=6066)|
| 1:41:13| And I know this is probably not the time, but I'd like to discuss basically the setup of these two audits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=6073)|
| 1:41:20| how they came about because we still, according to TCA 49-2-301,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=6080)|
| 1:41:28| the superintendent still has not notified this body of these two misappropriation of funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=6088)|
| 1:41:34| Still to this day, we have not got formal transmission from him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=6094)|
| 1:41:39| And we need to know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=6099)|
| 1:41:40| We need to know on the nutrition audit how far that went back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=6100)|
| 1:41:45| Notifying the new sentinel or the media or stuff is not the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=6105)|
| 1:41:51| Code says that it has to notify us and the commissioner of education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=6111)|
| 1:41:56| And those still have not been notified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=6116)|
| 1:42:00| We're talking the nutrition audit starting September 11th, and it wasn't, we didn't get a letter from them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=6120)|
| 1:42:07| until after we'd done call for the special audit of the nutrition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=6127)|
| 1:42:11| And then we got a letter saying they wanted us to audit it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=6131)|
| 1:42:16| And then now we've got the credit card, which is only the six credit cards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=6136)|
| 1:42:21| has the rest of these fuel cards, SAMS cards, have they been transferred over to the county's program?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=6141)|
| 1:42:29| Those are still out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=6149)|
| 1:42:32| The fuel cards, that's really troubling to me, 232 of them that are not monitored right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=6152)|
| 1:42:40| I mean, are they filling up their personal cars with these credit cards?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=6160)|
| 1:42:45| You know, that's a lot of credit cards, gas cards for somebody to be using.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=6165)|
| 1:42:50| And are they buying snacks and everything else through PILOT with those cards?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=6170)|
| 1:42:56| I mean, those are questions, if nobody's looked at them, that's the whole point of Andrea,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=6176)|
| 1:43:01| looking at all these credit cards to find out where we're at and where we need to go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=6181)|
| 1:43:05| and what processes we need to put in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=6185)|
| 1:43:08| If she finds any criminal activity, then that's stuff that needs to be turned over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=6188)|
| 1:43:12| And she said that by law she has to turn that over to the sheriff's office and the comptroller| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=6192)|
| 1:43:18| because they're investigating it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=6198)|
| 1:43:20| So I think some of these questions still need to be answered in what we're doing or how this came about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=6200)|
| 1:43:29| You know, when did the superintendent know and what does he know and when did he know it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=6209)|
| 1:43:34| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=6214)|
| 1:43:37| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=6217)|
| 1:43:40| Oh, wow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=6220)|
| 1:43:42| Okay, so, you know, I guess the last comment kind of makes my point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=6222)|
| 1:43:51| And I do agree with Commissioner Owenby, Commissioner Brantley,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=6231)|
| 1:43:56| in that the scope is my issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=6236)|
| 1:44:01| The scope is my only issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=6241)|
| 1:44:04| And it's for reasons as, you know, I would say is the theme behind statements like the one that was just made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=6244)|
| 1:44:12| And first dealt with it, you know, during a history lesson with Beck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=6252)|
| 1:44:17| The court of public opinion started in, they're still in the money, they're still in the money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=6257)|
| 1:44:22| And then we've got to have an audit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=6262)|
| 1:44:24| No, we don't want an internal audit, we want an external audit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=6264)|
| 1:44:27| No, we didn't want an external audit because it's going to cost money to do an internal audit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=6267)|
| 1:44:31| Then that one comes back clean and nothing's done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=6271)|
| 1:44:34| You know, people planted seeds around and folks know, you know, the seed planters know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=6274)|
| 1:44:40| And you just watch the crap grow up out of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=6280)|
| 1:44:46| There's some issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=6286)|
| 1:44:47| Let's stick to the issues and not let, again, the court of an email here or there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=6287)|
| 1:44:55| or planted, you know, seed here or there drive us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=6295)|
| 1:45:00| We're the legislative body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=6300)|
| 1:45:02| This is set up for us to start for a reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=6302)|
| 1:45:06| You know, the whole PPU thing, it didn't start out, okay, there were some issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=6306)|
| 1:45:11| but initially there was this big slush fund that people were just using to do this and that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=6311)|
| 1:45:16| and, you know, willy-nilly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=6316)|
| 1:45:18| That wasn't right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=6318)|
| 1:45:20| That wasn't based in fact, although some issues associated with the audit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=6320)|
| 1:45:25| and there were no material findings of, you know, theft and thievery and political gain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=6325)|
| 1:45:31| and all this other stuff that was this big innuendo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=6331)|
| 1:45:34| So, again, my whole point on this one, these things are going to get a look,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=6334)|
| 1:45:38| and I want them to get a good look.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=6338)|
| 1:45:41| But we've got to define the scope of this thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=6341)|
| 1:45:44| We have to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=6344)|
| 1:45:45| We can't let an email drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=6345)|
| 1:45:47| Well, we've got an email saying it is this way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=6347)|
| 1:45:50| We've got to throw out the internal auditor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=6350)|
| 1:45:53| We hired a pretty, what I've seen to be to this point, pretty darn good auditor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=6353)|
| 1:46:00| in terms of her being strategic in nature, understanding what her department is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=6360)|
| 1:46:05| what her scope is, and what her scope isn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=6365)|
| 1:46:07| I think we've done a good job, and we need to give her a scope and tell her to go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=6367)|
| 1:46:14| This, and I was sitting here trying to wordsmith it, this is not a scope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=6374)|
| 1:46:20| This is an open up all your drawers and have the three or four of us just start looking at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=6380)|
| 1:46:27| That's what we're telling her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=6387)|
| 1:46:29| That's no kind of guidance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=6389)|
| 1:46:31| She can't do that in any kind of reasonable time fashion as written.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=6391)|
| 1:46:37| So, again, I don't know how to start getting this into something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=6397)|
| 1:46:42| but I guess my question to Commissioner Wright, because I think he was starting down that road initially,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=6402)|
| 1:46:48| are these the words and all the other words that support this that came out of the audit committee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=6408)|
| 1:46:55| And if so, what do you think the end result was?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=6415)|
| 1:47:02| Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=6422)|
| 1:47:03| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=6423)|
| 1:47:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=6424)|
| 1:47:05| The audit committee met for a short period of time to make a look at some of the facts that were before us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=6425)|
| 1:47:18| and to guess that there were facts out there that we did not have knowledge of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=6438)|
| 1:47:25| and that some way a report must have been made to some point of authority,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=6445)|
| 1:47:32| which at some point in time results in what we read in the newspaper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=6452)|
| 1:47:38| And as I was saying when I first made my comment about the audit committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=6458)|
| 1:47:44| the thing that we want to avoid is having the auditor come back saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=6464)|
| 1:47:54| well, I ran into this, but it's not in the scope of what I was directed to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=6474)|
| 1:48:01| I believe the audit committee's recommendation to the full commission was that the internal auditor follow all leads| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=6481)|
| 1:48:13| as related to credit instruments used by the Board of Education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=6493)|
| 1:48:22| Okay, and we're starting with those six.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=6502)|
| 1:48:26| I believe that we've already had that discussion just a moment ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=6506)|
| 1:48:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=6509)|
| 1:48:30| All credit devices, vehicles, instruments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=6510)|
| 1:48:37| Travel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=6517)|
| 1:48:40| Well, no, just it doesn't matter whether it was travel or pencils or fuel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=6520)|
| 1:48:45| If it's done by a credit instrument, then it's fair to be looked at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=6525)|
| 1:48:52| under what the audit committee recommended to full commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=6532)|
| 1:48:57| Now, whenever you read the whereas, it says to be the extended scope shall be developed by the internal auditor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=6537)|
| 1:49:07| I want people to understand it's the largest scope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=6547)|
| 1:49:11| It's the most items to look at, not a few items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=6551)|
| 1:49:15| It's all the items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=6555)|
| 1:49:16| That's where we started when we were talking about this, when I was trying to talk about it earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=6556)|
| 1:49:26| Commissioner Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=6566)|
| 1:49:29| Thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=6569)|
| 1:49:33| You know, everything that's transpired in the past few months really, to me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=6573)|
| 1:49:40| says there needs to be transparency in the school system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=6580)|
| 1:49:47| I mean, it's just amazing that everything's supposedly fine, and then something else pops up, and then something else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=6587)|
| 1:49:52| And it just amazes me that somehow we can't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=6592)|
| 1:49:56| I realize the state of Tennessee controls basically the schools, but we provide the guidance and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=6596)|
| 1:50:03| But this is another red flag that we need more transparency there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=6603)|
| 1:50:08| Second of all, there is a misconception, as the emails everybody's referred to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=6608)|
| 1:50:13| that somehow this auditor, our internal auditor, works for the school board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=6613)|
| 1:50:18| I've had emails that say that, and it needs to be clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=6618)|
| 1:50:24| The internal auditor works for this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=6624)|
| 1:50:28| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=6628)|
| 1:50:29| And this body only.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=6629)|
| 1:50:31| And I'm very confident that they're very competent, and they're going to do an excellent job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=6631)|
| 1:50:37| I do trust that they're going to do a great job, and they're not going to be influenced by anybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=6637)|
| 1:50:43| Now, that being said, still let the people have their will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=6643)|
| 1:50:46| I mean, I can go either way on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=6646)|
| 1:50:50| I am concerned, though, are we putting so much work on our internal auditor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=6650)|
| 1:50:56| that then when it's not done in a brief amount of time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=6656)|
| 1:51:00| then everybody's going to be mad and assume there's shenanigans going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=6660)|
| 1:51:05| And third of all is the cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=6665)|
| 1:51:10| It's still we just throw around external audits, and somebody has to pay for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=6670)|
| 1:51:15| Now, I understand our external auditor is going to be paid on an hourly basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=6675)|
| 1:51:22| And the control of the state audit, we're going to pay for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=6682)|
| 1:51:30| The state's not going to pay for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=6690)|
| 1:51:32| We're going to pay for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=6692)|
| 1:51:34| So we're already paying to have an internal auditor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=6694)|
| 1:51:38| I really think we ought to let them do their job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=6698)|
| 1:51:41| If we don't like what we see, then we'll take the next step.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=6701)|
| 1:51:45| But I kind of feel like we have to do their job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=6705)|
| 1:51:47| But if the citizens of Knox County don't trust our internal auditor or, well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=6707)|
| 1:51:54| sometimes I don't think they trust anybody, we've got to make sure that they do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=6714)|
| 1:52:03| Chris, do you have something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=6723)|
| 1:52:05| Are you done, Mr. Thomas?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=6725)|
| 1:52:07| Yes, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=6727)|
| 1:52:09| Did you need something, Chris?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=6729)|
| 1:52:11| Let me clarify a few things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=6731)|
| 1:52:15| In the last few weeks, I've worked really closely with Andrea and our external auditors, Larry Elmore,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=6735)|
| 1:52:22| and with Bob Thomas and Ron McPherson at schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=6742)|
| 1:52:28| And so I'm going to give you all some information that I don't know if you all know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=6748)|
| 1:52:33| I'll just clarify a few things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=6753)|
| 1:52:35| The pilot cards that are at schools, the 223 or 232, whatever that number is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=6755)|
| 1:52:41| that program was issued through our purchasing department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=6761)|
| 1:52:46| And so that is a vetted process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=6766)|
| 1:52:49| It's similar to the one that is at our sheriff's department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=6769)|
| 1:52:54| We're going to work closely with schools from an internal control process to see how that is being handled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=6774)|
| 1:53:03| From the card standpoint itself, it was done appropriately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=6783)|
| 1:53:08| Since everything has taken place, I can tell you that the SAMS cards have been canceled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=6788)|
| 1:53:16| The six untrusted credit cards have been canceled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=6796)|
| 1:53:21| We're in the process of adopting, the schools are going to adopt the county's travel policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=6801)|
| 1:53:29| And in doing this, they will be allowed to get travel cards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=6809)|
| 1:53:33| We're also going to issue them some e-cards in place of these credit cards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=6813)|
| 1:53:38| They already have some e-cards that they use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=6818)|
| 1:53:40| And what we're going to do during this process is do a lot of training,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=6820)|
| 1:53:46| from e-card training with Jana Soar to contract and procurement training with Hugh Holt,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=6826)|
| 1:53:55| and also some AP training through our office and Jeff Clark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=6835)|
| 1:54:00| I know Bob is probably tired of looking at me because he saw me enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=6840)|
| 1:54:05| So we've got some things in place that we're working on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=6845)|
| 1:54:08| So I know that sometimes that doesn't get out, and so I want to just make that clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=6848)|
| 1:54:14| And we're continuing to work on some things, and I'm sure you'll hear about them soon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=6854)|
| 1:54:22| And I think we can get through this process and we'll be better for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=6862)|
| 1:54:28| It will be more transparent and it will be more efficient and effective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=6868)|
| 1:54:35| And I would like to speak on Andrea for a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=6875)|
| 1:54:38| I've worked really close with Andrea since she's been here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=6878)|
| 1:54:42| I know that we've talked a little bit about the timing of the PPU audit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=6882)|
| 1:54:47| I don't think some of the new commissioners are aware, when Andrea walked into her situation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=6887)|
| 1:54:53| she had nothing that she could use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=6893)|
| 1:54:57| I mean, she started ground zero.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=6897)|
| 1:54:59| And so she had to use a lot of time just to get policies and procedures in place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=6899)|
| 1:55:05| and get things where they need to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=6905)|
| 1:55:07| Then she had some staffing issues that we're in the process of addressing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=6907)|
| 1:55:11| And so I think a lot of the things was out of her control.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=6911)|
| 1:55:17| I also wanted to talk about what Dave talked about a little bit too, Commissioner Wright,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=6917)|
| 1:55:21| in the sense that she does have a work plan, a generalized work plan, that the Audit Committee does approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=6921)|
| 1:55:29| What you will hear if you come to the Audit Committee next week, I believe it is, from our external auditor, Larry Elmore,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=6929)|
| 1:55:37| he'll say, when you take the element of surprise away from internal audit, you have killed that role and that function.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=6937)|
| 1:55:46| He said in a meeting with me and Law Director Armstrong,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=6946)|
| 1:55:50| and he said you cannot limit what your internal auditor is doing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=6950)|
| 1:55:55| because when you limit the element of surprise, then that function is gone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=6955)|
| 1:56:01| And so if she has to get everything approved to say, oh, by the way, Chris,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=6961)|
| 1:56:06| I'm coming to finance to look at petty cash in three weeks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=6966)|
| 1:56:11| then that gives me time to clean up things that may not have been cleaned up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=6971)|
| 1:56:16| We don't have petty cash in finance, just so you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=6976)|
| 1:56:19| That's why I use that analogy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=6979)|
| 1:56:22| Exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=6982)|
| 1:56:23| And so just keep that in mind as you go through this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=6983)|
| 1:56:28| I wanted to clarify the school situation, because we've been in very close contact and working through some things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=6988)|
| 1:56:35| and a lot of that doesn't get out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=6995)|
| 1:56:37| There was a press release on the travel policy and those cards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=6997)|
| 1:56:41| But other than that, if you have anything for me, just feel free to call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=7001)|
| 1:56:46| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=7006)|
| 1:56:47| Mr. Caldwell, so you have given us significant pieces of information that we did not have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=7007)|
| 1:56:56| and I understand it takes time sometimes to get the word around of what's going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=7016)|
| 1:57:05| But let me ask you this question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=7025)|
| 1:57:07| If in your working with something, something, and you find something, are you bound by it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=7027)|
| 1:57:17| We're talking yellow book stuff now, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=7037)|
| 1:57:21| If you come into something that you perceive personally and professionally,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=7041)|
| 1:57:27| you find questions about its appropriateness or its legalities, you go to law enforcement, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=7047)|
| 1:57:37| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=7057)|
| 1:57:38| And then your lips are sealed from us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=7058)|
| 1:57:41| That's a fair statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=7061)|
| 1:57:43| I wanted to start there because I think with the facts as we read them or hear it in the local media,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=7063)|
| 1:57:54| there are people off the payroll permanently, and there are also people off the payroll pending.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=7074)|
| 1:58:05| Now I'm going to speak to commission for just a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=7085)|
| 1:58:08| In the many, many, many, many months, because I've not been here all that many years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=7088)|
| 1:58:16| we've had phantom employees, we've had inappropriate payment of monies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=7096)|
| 1:58:27| and those things have laid with us for years until there will be resolution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=7107)|
| 1:58:35| and some of them are still laying with us unresolved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=7115)|
| 1:58:40| So I think the thing that we sitting commissioners have to realize is that we may not be able to know the resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=7120)|
| 1:58:48| of some of these things until way after our terms have ended on these things that are just now coming up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=7128)|
| 1:58:57| because the things I mentioned a moment ago, one was a couple, three years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=7137)|
| 1:59:02| one was occurring long before any of us became interested in being on this political body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=7142)|
| 1:59:09| So there are things that we will not know because of law enforcement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=7149)|
| 1:59:16| and there are things that will take an extreme length of time to wind their way through the courts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=7156)|
| 1:59:22| Thank you, Mr. Caldwell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=7162)|
| 1:59:25| Yes, Commissioner Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=7165)|
| 1:59:29| Like I say, I'm new at this, but it seems that we're charged with, as it says in the code annotated 49-2-101 Section 3,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=7169)|
| 1:59:40| that if we feel or see that it appears that money is being misused, then we've got to act on it, which we did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=7180)|
| 1:59:49| But there's one thing that we haven't had, and that's information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=7189)|
| 1:59:54| And under the county code that Chairman Ormby said, 49-2-301,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=7194)|
| 2:00:00| there's statutory responsibilities that the superintendent or the director of schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=7200)|
| 2:00:07| how it's printed in here, owes us, and he hadn't been here to give us that information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=7207)|
| 2:00:12| That's his statutory responsibility, and I'll read it right here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=7212)|
| 2:00:16| We report to the local legislative body, that's us, and it says, and to the commissioner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=7216)|
| 2:00:22| which is, I guess, the state commissioner, whenever it appears to the director,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=7222)|
| 2:00:28| that any portion of the school's funds has been or in danger of being misappropriated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=7228)|
| 2:00:34| or in any way illegally disposed of or not collected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=7234)|
| 2:00:38| Now, I've been here three meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=7238)|
| 2:00:42| We've had instances occur, and I have yet to have the superintendent of schools give us a report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=7242)|
| 2:00:49| And I hope this commission will demand that statutory responsibility from the superintendent of schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=7249)|
| 2:00:57| And that's all I've got to say about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=7257)|
| 2:00:59| We need that report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=7259)|
| 2:01:00| We're working on information that should have been reported to us months ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=7260)|
| 2:01:05| So I think we need to demand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=7265)|
| 2:01:08| We need to expect it and have that report from our superintendent or director of schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=7268)|
| 2:01:14| I'll get with the law department and craft a letter or an email to him and ask him for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=7274)|
| 2:01:19| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=7279)|
| 2:01:22| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=7282)|
| 2:01:25| Each of you all asked yourself this question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=7285)|
| 2:01:27| I'm laying on a hospital operating table getting a heart transplant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=7287)|
| 2:01:33| and while he's got me all cut open, he finds out my gallbladder is bad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=7293)|
| 2:01:39| Do you want him to go ahead and saw you up and let somebody else work out the gallbladder,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=7299)|
| 2:01:44| or do you want to eat your gallbladder while you're in there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=7304)|
| 2:01:47| I mean, that's what we're talking about here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=7307)|
| 2:01:49| If she finds something that she feels is wrong with her expert opinion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=7309)|
| 2:01:57| then she has and should have the authority to go ahead and do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=7317)|
| 2:02:02| Since these credit cards have been canceled,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=7322)|
| 2:02:05| she doesn't have to worry about process as much anymore, maybe as she would normally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=7325)|
| 2:02:10| She can go straight to the heart of the matter and look at the individual items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=7330)|
| 2:02:14| And this is what has to be done and needs to be done yesterday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=7334)|
| 2:02:18| Now, we've fiddled around here for an hour and a half| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=7338)|
| 2:02:20| and decided we haven't yet voted that this should be going in and getting done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=7340)|
| 2:02:24| So I call for the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=7344)|
| 2:02:28| Real quickly, I've got two more people, but I also searched my e-mail| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=7348)|
| 2:02:32| because I thought I saw an e-mail from Dr. McIntyre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=7352)|
| 2:02:35| and I do have an e-mail that I failed to forward to you guys dated October 30th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=7355)|
| 2:02:39| and I'm doing it right now, in regards to his statutory requirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=7359)|
| 2:02:42| He met that requirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=7362)|
| 2:02:44| I just didn't fill it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=7364)|
| 2:02:45| I thought it went to the whole commission, and it didn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=7365)|
| 2:02:47| So I'll take care of that right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=7367)|
| 2:02:48| Commissioner Brantley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=7368)|
| 2:02:49| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=7369)|
| 2:02:50| Just very briefly, I'd like to make a substitute motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=7370)|
| 2:02:53| that we have our internal auditor investigate the six credit cards for the five years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=7373)|
| 2:03:00| and all other credit cards in Knox County Schools for two years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=7380)|
| 2:03:05| and report back to Knox County Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=7385)|
| 2:03:08| And depending upon the results, we can go further from there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=7388)|
| 2:03:11| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=7391)|
| 2:03:13| How about a friendly amendment to that credit devices?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=7393)|
| 2:03:17| Why do you want to tie her hands?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=7397)|
| 2:03:19| Well, here's my thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=7399)|
| 2:03:21| She's going to find there's already the investigative part of what we're desiring to find| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=7401)|
| 2:03:28| is already being done by the comptroller.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=7408)|
| 2:03:30| She's going to go back and study systems, not numbers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=7410)|
| 2:03:34| because once she finds something criminal, she has to turn it over to the comptroller.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=7414)|
| 2:03:38| I just want to make sure that you all are aware that if she finds something criminal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=7418)|
| 2:03:42| she stops and starts to report it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=7422)|
| 2:03:45| It's already been reported, so I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=7425)|
| 2:03:48| I wish she were here today, but she's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=7428)|
| 2:03:50| Do you have anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=7430)|
| 2:03:51| Do you have a substitute motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=7431)|
| 2:03:52| Well, the point is that we've been requested by the school board to do this audit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=7432)|
| 2:03:58| I'm just saying that we go ahead with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=7438)|
| 2:04:00| If she has to stop, she has to stop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=7440)|
| 2:04:02| But we should proceed with everything that we have in our power to make sure that happens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=7442)|
| 2:04:07| I'm not comfortable with giving her co-op loan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=7447)|
| 2:04:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=7450)|
| 2:04:11| Commissioner Willoughby.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=7451)|
| 2:04:14| I see Chris left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=7454)|
| 2:04:15| I really wanted to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=7455)|
| 2:04:16| Oh, there you are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=7456)|
| 2:04:17| Sorry, Chris.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=7457)|
| 2:04:18| I thought you had walked out the door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=7458)|
| 2:04:22| I don't know if you can answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=7462)|
| 2:04:23| I know the purchasing department issued the pilot gas cards and all that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=7463)|
| 2:04:30| I'm not disputing that they weren't done properly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=7470)|
| 2:04:33| My question is, is who's monitoring those?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=7473)|
| 2:04:37| Are we balancing the fuel that's entered, the mileage that's entered?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=7477)|
| 2:04:43| Are we making sure that somebody's not, you know, not saying that anybody is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=7483)|
| 2:04:48| but are we making sure that there's a pin attached to these that it ties to that person that used that card| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=7488)|
| 2:04:55| and that they're not using it every single day, you know, unless they're driving 400 and something miles a day?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=7495)|
| 2:05:03| That's my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=7503)|
| 2:05:04| I mean, in the private sector, that's what they do with their gas cards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=7504)|
| 2:05:06| You enter the mileage, you enter your pin number, and it's linked to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=7506)|
| 2:05:10| And they balance it every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=7510)|
| 2:05:12| So I didn't know if that's happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=7512)|
| 2:05:15| I've been told that it's not, and that's the reason I'm asking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=7515)|
| 2:05:20| To be quite honest, I can't answer that question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=7520)|
| 2:05:22| We've not got into the internal control process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=7522)|
| 2:05:27| I thought she wanted to answer part of the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=7527)|
| 2:05:29| Oh, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=7529)|
| 2:05:32| We've not got into the internal control process of those pilot cards yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=7532)|
| 2:05:38| I do know that Roger was overseeing those cards, I do believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=7538)|
| 2:05:43| Bob would know more than I.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=7543)|
| 2:05:46| And how that process was working from a standpoint of internal controls and reconciliation, I'm not for sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=7546)|
| 2:05:55| I know in the sheriff's office we do monitor those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=7555)|
| 2:05:57| We do the mileage and everything from my understanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=7557)|
| 2:06:02| I can tell you that I have seen something that came up about pilot travel cards in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=7562)|
| 2:06:10| And I actually sat down with the sheriff's department, and they went through their process with me at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=7570)|
| 2:06:16| And so I know how that process works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=7576)|
| 2:06:18| And there's duplication of checks here and there and checks and balances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=7578)|
| 2:06:22| And so I know how those work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=7582)|
| 2:06:24| I told Bob Thomas at schools that as we look through those internal control processes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=7584)|
| 2:06:30| we can get them with the sheriff's department and we can develop a plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=7590)|
| 2:06:34| If that's not what they're doing, I can't say that's not what they're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=7594)|
| 2:06:37| I'm not for sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=7597)|
| 2:06:38| Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=7598)|
| 2:06:42| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=7602)|
| 2:06:43| What we have before us right now is a substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=7603)|
| 2:06:47| Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=7607)|
| 2:06:48| I think Sam seconded it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=7608)|
| 2:06:50| I did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=7610)|
| 2:06:52| Commissioner Hornby said something following that about is it just six credit cards or is it credit instruments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=7612)|
| 2:07:02| Devices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=7622)|
| 2:07:05| Again, I ask, why do you want to tie her hands?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=7625)|
| 2:07:08| Well, that's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=7628)|
| 2:07:09| Devices opens it up to anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=7629)|
| 2:07:12| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=7632)|
| 2:07:13| I don't know if that friendly amendment was accepted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=7633)|
| 2:07:17| I know it's a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=7637)|
| 2:07:18| That's my point of order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=7638)|
| 2:07:19| Yeah, that's why you're bringing this up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=7639)|
| 2:07:20| Because I guess I don't understand the word devices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=7640)|
| 2:07:22| We're just introducing terms left and right here, and I don't know if anybody knows the definition of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=7642)|
| 2:07:28| So I'm struggling with the word devices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=7648)|
| 2:07:31| So then I'm asking the question, as we get ready to vote on this, are you limiting this to the six credit cards?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=7651)|
| 2:07:41| I'm limiting it to what the school board asked us to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=7661)|
| 2:07:44| And that is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=7664)|
| 2:07:45| The six credit cards and all other credit cards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=7665)|
| 2:07:49| The six credit cards for five years and all other credit cards for two years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=7669)|
| 2:07:54| That's what it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=7674)|
| 2:07:57| So that would be any type of credit thing, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=7677)|
| 2:08:00| It has to be on a credit card or some type of credit thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=7680)|
| 2:08:06| That's a good terminology, credit thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=7686)|
| 2:08:08| Credit thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=7688)|
| 2:08:09| I like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=7689)|
| 2:08:11| Credit instrument.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=7691)|
| 2:08:13| Yeah, credit instrument.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=7693)|
| 2:08:14| That's not what they asked for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=7694)|
| 2:08:17| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=7697)|
| 2:08:18| We have a substitute motion on the floor to go to the six credit cards for five years, all other credit cards for two years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=7698)|

| 2:10:33| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=7833)|

| 2:10:40| Consideration of an Ordinance of the Commission of Knox County, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=7840)|
| 2:10:43| amending Knox County Code, Chapter 46, Article 2,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=7843)|

| 2:11:25| This is on First Reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=7885)|
| 2:11:27| Ordinance 101.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=7887)|

| 2:11:35| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=7895)|
| 2:11:37| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=7897)|
| 2:11:38| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=7898)|
| 2:11:39| Oh, sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=7899)|
| 2:11:40| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=7900)|
| 2:11:41| Go ahead, Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=7901)|
| 2:11:43| Well, we were just, as this was being read,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=7903)|
| 2:11:46| so I just maybe ask the Law Director for just kind of an overarching,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=7906)|
| 2:11:51| the point and purpose of this is to get things aligned better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=7911)|
| 2:11:54| Could you speak to it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=7914)|
| 2:12:00| What we're trying to do here, historically,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=7920)|
| 2:12:03| if we go back to the 94 issues and so forth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=7923)|
| 2:12:06| they're talking about civil districts and other strata that these library boards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=7926)|
| 2:12:13| should be based upon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=7933)|
| 2:12:15| And what this body has been doing is basing it many times,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=7935)|
| 2:12:20| if you will, upon commissionary districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=7940)|
| 2:12:23| So what we're trying to do is align behavior with the ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=7943)|
| 2:12:30| and trying to clear up where the civil districts are not as a prominent issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=7950)|
| 2:12:35| as they once were back in the 90s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=7955)|
| 2:12:37| Now we do everything by commission district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=7957)|
| 2:12:39| That's one of the major things we're trying to align.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=7959)|
| 2:12:42| It really doesn't affect what we've done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=7962)|
| 2:12:45| It just helps clarify how we go about doing it in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=7965)|
| 2:12:50| So each commissioner would have a library board member,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=7970)|
| 2:12:54| as they've tried to do in the past without us trying to figure out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=7974)|
| 2:12:57| which civil district it belongs in, what commissioner it goes to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=7977)|
| 2:13:00| and what they're changing at the state every so often that shifts everything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=7980)|
| 2:13:05| because they're not in alignment with the commission district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=7985)|
| 2:13:08| That's the biggest angst out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=7988)|
| 2:13:10| So we're trying to do a little house cleaning with this, I guess, to conform.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=7990)|
| 2:13:17| Does it create any problems that we've already seated a person| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=7997)|
| 2:13:20| before this resolution's been read twice?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=8000)|
| 2:13:25| Say that again, Randy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=8005)|
| 2:13:28| We did vote to place somebody in one of these seats earlier today, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=8008)|
| 2:13:31| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=8011)|
| 2:13:32| Does it cause any problems voting them in by seat| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=8012)|
| 2:13:35| before we've read this resolution in twice?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=8015)|
| 2:13:37| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=8017)|
| 2:13:38| No, not any more than we had in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=8018)|
| 2:13:43| We have a motion and a second on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=8023)|
| 2:13:44| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=8024)|
| 2:13:45| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=8025)|
| 2:13:46| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=8026)|

| 2:14:11| On this right here, what I wanted to bring up here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=8051)|
| 2:14:14| we had a letter come to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=8054)|
| 2:14:16| We had the auditor, Ms. Addis, I believe it's her last name now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=8056)|
| 2:14:22| came up and expressed, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=8062)|
| 2:14:25| what they were needing to do from the school board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=8065)|
| 2:14:29| We, as a legislative body, passed the resolution to go ahead and start the audit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=8069)|
| 2:14:37| And I asked the question at the time, is this all we need to do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=8077)|
| 2:14:40| And I think I said that, I think I was told, yes, it was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=8080)|
| 2:14:43| and she could, you know, start her audit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=8083)|
| 2:14:47| But the other day I was asking Ms. Addis up here on this dais| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=8087)|
| 2:14:51| when we were having, I guess, the workshop,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=8091)|
| 2:14:54| had that impacted her starting the audit because she went to the audit committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=8094)|
| 2:14:59| or she was going to the audit committee to get her direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=8099)|
| 2:15:03| And I thought that, number one, that once we passed a resolution and voted on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=8103)|
| 2:15:09| that was a done deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=8109)|
| 2:15:11| You didn't have to go to any other kind of body for her to start her audit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=8111)|
| 2:15:16| Now, am I wrong with that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=8116)|
| 2:15:18| Once we make a motion and we vote on it, does it have to go to another commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=8118)|
| 2:15:23| or is this the last stop?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=8123)|
| 2:15:24| And once we tell somebody to do something, aren't they supposed to start on it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=8124)|
| 2:15:29| She works at the direction of the audit committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=8129)|
| 2:15:32| and the commission upon approval of the resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=8132)|
| 2:15:36| I don't know exactly what you're, which audit you're referring to in regards to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=8136)|
| 2:15:41| Are you talking about workshop?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=8141)|
| 2:15:42| Well, we were at the, not at the workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=8142)|
| 2:15:45| We were up here at the last month's committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=8145)|
| 2:15:48| You were absent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=8148)|
| 2:15:50| And the letter was brought to us and we determined that there was an audit needed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=8150)|
| 2:15:54| and we passed a resolution to start the audit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=8154)|
| 2:15:57| Am I correct on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=8157)|
| 2:15:58| That was nutrition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=8158)|
| 2:15:59| What?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=8159)|
| 2:16:00| Nutrition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=8160)|
| 2:16:01| That was nutrition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=8161)|
| 2:16:02| Nutrition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=8162)|
| 2:16:03| Yes, she started that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=8163)|
| 2:16:05| She said she didn't right away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=8165)|
| 2:16:06| She had to get directions from the audit committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=8166)|
| 2:16:09| On the scope and the, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=8169)|
| 2:16:11| But she didn't start it until she got some, okay, I guess you said something in a paper| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=8171)|
| 2:16:17| that you went ahead and told her she could go ahead and start.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=8177)|
| 2:16:20| That was on credit card.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=8180)|
| 2:16:24| Well, one of the ones she didn't start after we had approved that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=8184)|
| 2:16:29| And then I've got one other thing to go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=8189)|
| 2:16:31| I think the law director wants to correct me on something here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=8191)|
| 2:16:37| No, it's not a correction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=8197)|
| 2:16:38| It was actually how you all passed the resolution that put the brakes on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=8198)|
| 2:16:45| The ordinance that created the audit committee says that things shall be just coordinated through there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=8205)|
| 2:16:58| And once this body says do it, she does it and then she coordinates it through there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=8218)|
| 2:17:03| and it comes back to you all eventually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=8223)|
| 2:17:05| But if I recall on that particular one, the resolution actually sent it back to the audit committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=8225)|
| 2:17:11| and that's what put the brakes on her because it wasn't go ahead and do good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=8231)|
| 2:17:16| It was go ahead and find out from the audit committee what you need to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=8236)|
| 2:17:20| It wasn't a normal resolution like we would normally pass and say go audit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=8240)|
| 2:17:25| and she would perceive and then coordinate it through the audit committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=8245)|
| 2:17:29| It was more directed to go back to the audit committee and audit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=8249)|
| 2:17:33| It was the wording about that particular one, if I recall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=8253)|
| 2:17:37| I don't have it right on the top of my head, but it was something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=8257)|
| 2:17:39| It was a little different than you normally do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=8259)|
| 2:17:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=8263)|
| 2:17:44| The other issue that came up, and I think you added to it, Commissioner Anders,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=8264)|
| 2:17:50| that the letter was sent to you from the superintendent of schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=8270)|
| 2:17:56| Now, I need clarification on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=8276)|
| 2:17:58| The way the statute reads, it says report to the legislative body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=8278)|
| 2:18:03| And I was thinking that that would have to be down at the podium and we kind of could ask questions on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=8283)|
| 2:18:10| Now, if it's between, not close to that, I mean, I wasn't notified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=8290)|
| 2:18:18| I admitted 10, 15 minutes ago that was an error on my part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=8298)|
| 2:18:21| He is to notify the chairman or he notified that he took care of his.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=8301)|
| 2:18:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=8306)|
| 2:18:27| He sent me an e-mail and I failed to forward that e-mail thinking it went to the whole commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=8307)|
| 2:18:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=8311)|
| 2:18:32| But the legislative body is the chairman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=8312)|
| 2:18:35| Well, he can't, I mean, he could send the e-mail to everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=8315)|
| 2:18:39| I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=8319)|
| 2:18:41| He fulfilled his obligation to send it to the commission chair who should have sent it out to everybody on the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=8321)|
| 2:18:47| But did, and the other thing, what I was talking about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=8327)|
| 2:18:50| I also understood that he hasn't reported on two of the other issues to the body, has he?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=8330)|
| 2:18:57| Not that I'm aware of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=8337)|
| 2:18:58| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=8338)|
| 2:18:59| I know I got the Underwood letter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=8339)|
| 2:19:01| You got the Underwood letter and that was it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=8341)|
| 2:19:03| And see, the only thing I'm finding out from is from the paper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=8343)|
| 2:19:07| And it shouldn't be that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=8347)|
| 2:19:08| And that's why I would like this commission to really push to make sure he reports to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=8348)|
| 2:19:12| We finally did get a letter on the DICL, but it was from September 11th to October 16th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=8352)|
| 2:19:19| Yeah, 16th of October, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=8359)|
| 2:19:22| But the Underwood letter was purely my fault.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=8362)|
| 2:19:24| And I don't think he would take questions anyway because it's an ongoing investigation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=8364)|
| 2:19:27| I don't think he would answer those questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=8367)|
| 2:19:30| Well, there are some questions I think you can ask that he could answer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=8370)|
| 2:19:34| but not going into the detail of legal investigation if we needed to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=8374)|
| 2:19:40| Any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=8380)|
| 2:19:43| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=8383)|
| 2:19:46| Discussion regarding the process of filling the commission vacancy for the 5th Commission District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=8386)|
| 2:19:52| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=8392)|
| 2:19:53| Go ahead, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=8393)|
| 2:19:54| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=8394)|
| 2:19:55| I believe you've got the details worked out on what we're supposed to do about the replacement of the vacant 5th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=8395)|
| 2:20:01| What we're supposed to do is make public notice and accept applications,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=8401)|
| 2:20:07| and we just really need to set the dates and the times that you guys want to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=8407)|
| 2:20:11| Do you want to do it December?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=8411)|
| 2:20:12| Do you want to do it the first week?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=8412)|
| 2:20:14| Do you want to do it at the December meeting, or do you want to do it the first week of January?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=8414)|
| 2:20:17| It's up to you guys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=8417)|
| 2:20:18| How about doing the forum immediately following next workshop and then vote on it next meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=8418)|
| 2:20:24| If that's the pleasure of the ----| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=8424)|
| 2:20:26| We have three weeks to turn in their resumes, and then we can interview them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=8426)|
| 2:20:30| and then it gives us another week to vote on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=8430)|
| 2:20:34| We can't hear you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=8434)|
| 2:20:35| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=8435)|
| 2:20:36| I think if we do it like Commissioner Brown said, we hold the interviews after the workshop next month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=8436)|
| 2:20:44| and then we can vote on it the following week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=8444)|
| 2:20:46| That allows us three weeks basically to take their resumes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=8446)|
| 2:20:49| which we've already received two phone calls already in the interest of people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=8449)|
| 2:20:55| and then basically it gives us a month to look over the resumes and then vote on them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=8455)|
| 2:21:02| So you're saying the vote's in January?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=8462)|
| 2:21:04| No, in December.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=8464)|
| 2:21:05| December commission meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=8465)|
| 2:21:07| That's in three weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=8467)|
| 2:21:08| Yeah, so how's that going to give us a month to look at resumes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=8468)|
| 2:21:10| I don't think it does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=8470)|
| 2:21:11| Well, it's three weeks either way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=8471)|
| 2:21:14| I'm assuming they're doing it today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=8474)|
| 2:21:16| It's a month from today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=8476)|
| 2:21:18| The other option would be to call a special meeting the first week of January and vote them in then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=8478)|
| 2:21:25| I mean, there's two ways to look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=8485)|
| 2:21:29| I mean, I'll do what the majority of the commission decides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=8489)|
| 2:21:32| But the first week, we could do it on December the 15th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=8492)|
| 2:21:36| It gives you a month from today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=8496)|
| 2:21:38| You've got to put out a notice, get a deadline, interview.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=8498)|
| 2:21:43| You've got really two weeks to get a deadline because you've got to have the resumes in for the workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=8503)|
| 2:21:46| So it's really two weeks, two and a half.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=8506)|
| 2:21:51| Or we can call a special meeting the first week of January.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=8511)|
| 2:21:53| Commissioner Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=8513)|
| 2:21:55| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=8515)|
| 2:21:56| What are the exact deadlines we have to live within?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=8516)|
| 2:22:00| Is there anything, as a law director, is there anything that we have to conform to in order to fill this position,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=8520)|
| 2:22:06| or it's just whatever we decide?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=8526)|
| 2:22:09| Well, you have a statutory limit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=8529)|
| 2:22:10| I think it has to be filled within 120 days of vacancy, if I recall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=8530)|
| 2:22:17| The actual vacancy, which could not be rescinded, I know that Dr. Briggs said effective the 10th in his letter, if I recall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=8537)|
| 2:22:26| But the effective date could actually be determined as of today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=8546)|
| 2:22:31| because a letter of resignation is not accepted until this board votes on it or by spread of record today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=8551)|
| 2:22:39| So you theoretically could have a, I mean, it's arguable that we could have 120 days from today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=8559)|
| 2:22:46| So you could possibly vote on it in your, I can't do the math, January meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=8566)|
| 2:22:52| Would that get you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=8572)|
| 2:22:53| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=8573)|
| 2:22:54| You could vote in January, but if you voted them in the first week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=8574)|
| 2:22:57| it would allow that person to observe the agenda and then vote for their district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=8577)|
| 2:23:03| Anything you do would be pushing representation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=8583)|
| 2:23:06| I mean, the quicker, the sooner, the better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=8586)|
| 2:23:08| Where we are, you have statutorily required to do a notice in a paper of general circulation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=8588)|
| 2:23:15| that generally takes, what is it, seven days to get it done?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=8595)|
| 2:23:22| How long does it take you generally to get a notice in the paper?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=8602)|
| 2:23:25| Two days?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=8605)|
| 2:23:26| So you'd have two days from today and then whatever deadline you proposed would give you your resumes in before the workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=8606)|
| 2:23:37| You could have your hearings in the workshop and then vote on them in December, I guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=8617)|
| 2:23:42| if you wanted to really fast track it, but we're on a short stick, so that's a policy thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=8622)|
| 2:23:47| Anyway, you have 120 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=8627)|
| 2:23:49| You have Thanksgiving in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=8629)|
| 2:23:53| I personally think the faster we can do it is fine with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=8633)|
| 2:23:56| It's not like it's a secret.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=8636)|
| 2:23:58| I mean, it's not like anybody's thinking about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=8638)|
| 2:24:00| Doesn't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=8640)|
| 2:24:01| Doesn't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=8641)|
| 2:24:03| Commissioner Brantley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=8643)|
| 2:24:05| Well, I disagree with Commissioner Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=8645)|
| 2:24:07| I think it's a process that we should stand on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=8647)|
| 2:24:11| Wait a minute, what's that all about?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=8651)|
| 2:24:16| I think it's something we should meticulously do it and over the holidays| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=8656)|
| 2:24:24| and let people who want to ask questions or get more involved in it, people in that district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=8664)|
| 2:24:30| and I'm thinking January myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=8670)|
| 2:24:35| Commissioner Oldman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=8675)|
| 2:24:36| Yeah, one last.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=8676)|
| 2:24:39| It's actually three weeks to our workshop from today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=8679)|
| 2:24:42| and four weeks for our next meeting, our voting meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=8682)|
| 2:24:46| But if we do it in January, that only gives them basically two weeks to get abreast of the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=8686)|
| 2:24:52| It's better than 15 minutes from the time we vote them in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=8692)|
| 2:24:55| Well, no, I'm saying if we vote them in on the 15th, they're. . .| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=8695)|
| 2:25:00| They sit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=8700)|
| 2:25:02| They're sitting and voting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=8702)|
| 2:25:03| They're sitting at that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=8703)|
| 2:25:05| Yeah, that's true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=8705)|
| 2:25:06| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=8706)|
| 2:25:07| Commissioner, is that all you've got, Jim?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=8707)|
| 2:25:09| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=8709)|
| 2:25:10| Just real quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=8710)|
| 2:25:11| You're the judge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=8711)|
| 2:25:12| Just real quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=8712)|
| 2:25:13| How long, and I know we're not going to do a special election, so how long will this seat. . .| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=8713)|
| 2:25:18| Sixteen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=8718)|
| 2:25:20| Fulfill his term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=8720)|
| 2:25:21| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=8721)|
| 2:25:22| So that's why I'm really kind of with Commissioner Brantley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=8722)|
| 2:25:26| Let's not rush this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=8726)|
| 2:25:28| This isn't like the school board, a month or two months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=8728)|
| 2:25:32| This will be a commission and it's going to represent a significant portion of our population.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=8732)|
| 2:25:38| So I don't see the issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=8738)|
| 2:25:40| It sounds like we're within the law to push this off to January, allow people to. . .| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=8740)|
| 2:25:46| This is not an easy decision to make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=8746)|
| 2:25:48| There's some quality candidates who are saying, do I really want my head to hurt that hard for two years?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=8748)|
| 2:25:54| This is a major commitment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=8754)|
| 2:25:55| So I would hate to rush this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=8755)|
| 2:26:00| So I'd be more inclined to start the process now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=8760)|
| 2:26:04| but let's not vote them in until they give us time to vet as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=8764)|
| 2:26:08| and them time to get their information in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=8768)|
| 2:26:11| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=8771)|
| 2:26:13| Yeah, I'm with Commissioner Brantley on this too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=8773)|
| 2:26:16| I don't see a need to rush it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=8776)|
| 2:26:18| I want to have some time to talk to the people that are in the community and actually sit down with these candidates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=8778)|
| 2:26:24| I don't feel like we need to rush this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=8784)|
| 2:26:26| Commissioner McKenzie is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=8786)|
| 2:26:29| This is not a temporary seat of short time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=8789)|
| 2:26:32| This is a pretty good long term that this person is going to sit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=8792)|
| 2:26:35| and I feel we need to take our time and do this right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=8795)|
| 2:26:37| It's not an audit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=8797)|
| 2:26:41| Commissioner, are we going to vote on something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=8801)|
| 2:26:43| I don't know if we're going to vote or if it's just a discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=8803)|
| 2:26:46| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=8806)|
| 2:26:47| You can't vote on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=8807)|
| 2:26:48| So we're going to wait until next month and decide what we're going to do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=8808)|
| 2:26:52| No, we're going to try to set the date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=8812)|
| 2:26:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=8814)|
| 2:26:55| You can set the date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=8815)|
| 2:26:58| So we're going to have a motion before us eventually?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=8818)|
| 2:27:00| Yeah, I'll make a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=8820)|
| 2:27:02| You don't need a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=8822)|
| 2:27:03| Don't need a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=8823)|
| 2:27:04| You can't vote on it anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=8824)|
| 2:27:07| I can check the calendar for a special called meeting in January, first week of January after the new year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=8827)|
| 2:27:14| and we'll have an afternoon, a 4 o'clock session or something like that on a day that nobody else is meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=8834)|
| 2:27:20| if that's conducive to everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=8840)|
| 2:27:23| Maybe set up an interview time sometime or maybe do it that night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=8843)|
| 2:27:27| Do it all in one night if y'all want to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=8847)|
| 2:27:31| A called meeting to make the appointment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=8851)|
| 2:27:33| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=8853)|
| 2:27:34| So when are we going to have the hearing of looking at resumes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=8854)|
| 2:27:39| Are you going to have the interview the same time as the call?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=8859)|
| 2:27:41| I was thinking about doing it all in one meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=8861)|
| 2:27:45| I think it should be mandatory they come to the candidates come and speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=8865)|
| 2:27:51| I mean, we could have two hours of session and then a vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=8871)|
| 2:27:54| I mean, you're going to know who you're going to vote for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=8874)|
| 2:27:56| What's the deadline for resume?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=8876)|
| 2:27:59| Let's set.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=8879)|
| 2:28:02| We could probably go a month out then, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=8882)|
| 2:28:06| Yeah, we could probably do December the 15th, Monday the 15th, we'll get to take the resumes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=8886)|
| 2:28:12| And then the call meeting, we'd have two or three weeks to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=8892)|
| 2:28:19| Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=8899)|
| 2:28:20| The 15th, we'll deadline it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=8900)|
| 2:28:21| That's all right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=8901)|
| 2:28:26| End of business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=8906)|
| 2:28:28| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=8908)|
| 2:28:29| But there again, so we close resumes on the 15th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=8909)|
| 2:28:32| Nominations can be made at election time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=8912)|
| 2:28:35| So it's a known fact that for the last month that Dr. Briggs is going to be replaced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=8915)|
| 2:28:45| That's been, we've known that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=8925)|
| 2:28:48| We're talking about we could fill that seat a month from now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=8928)|
| 2:28:52| That's 60 days from the day he left until the day he's replaced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=8932)|
| 2:28:57| We can also wait until January, but if we wait until January,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=8937)|
| 2:29:01| we're still going to have a certain date that we sit down and we can get anybody's name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=8941)|
| 2:29:08| We can have any nominees placed that meeting time, and it's two months away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=8948)|
| 2:29:16| The resumes have always been customary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=8956)|
| 2:29:18| I don't understand it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=8958)|
| 2:29:19| I was going to say, I don't think anyone's walked in here and won a vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=8959)|
| 2:29:22| I know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=8962)|
| 2:29:23| There's never been a ride-in win, has there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=8963)|
| 2:29:25| That hasn't happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=8965)|
| 2:29:27| So I think I hear you agreeing with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=8967)|
| 2:29:29| Why are we going off too much from now when we can do it before the end of the year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=8969)|
| 2:29:33| Well, the only objection I have is the holidays.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=8973)|
| 2:29:36| I mean, a lot of people take off a week during Christmas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=8976)|
| 2:29:38| You've got Thanksgiving in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=8978)|
| 2:29:40| You've got New Year's in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=8980)|
| 2:29:43| If they are really dying to be a commissioner, they'll be here at that meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=8983)|
| 2:29:48| That's what we say about everyone that shows up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=8988)|
| 2:29:50| If they want to be here, they'll be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=8990)|
| 2:29:59| Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=8999)|
| 2:30:00| Yeah, just quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=9000)|
| 2:30:01| If I'm hearing you say the deadline is useless, then there's no use having a deadline, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=9001)|
| 2:30:05| I mean, people can still – I mean, is there –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=9005)|
| 2:30:08| I've never understood the deadline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=9008)|
| 2:30:09| There's just always been one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=9009)|
| 2:30:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=9010)|
| 2:30:11| So everybody can really – so it's really for the commissioners to gather thoughts and to gather resumes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=9011)|
| 2:30:17| It's a suggestion you should give to us before the 15th of December.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=9017)|
| 2:30:21| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=9021)|
| 2:30:22| If you want to be – that's personal consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=9022)|
| 2:30:24| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=9024)|
| 2:30:25| Is anybody – okay, Corrine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=9025)|
| 2:30:28| Commissioner Wright, I get what you're saying, that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=9028)|
| 2:30:31| people have known how this election is going to go for a while,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=9031)|
| 2:30:34| but I think the voters may be a little bit busy over November and December,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=9034)|
| 2:30:40| and that's who I really want to hear from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=9040)|
| 2:30:42| I don't want – I want to appoint somebody that the people want representing them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=9042)|
| 2:30:46| and they may be kind of busy, and it may take a while to talk to a bunch of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=9046)|
| 2:30:52| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=9052)|
| 2:30:53| I mean, I know it's not 100% consensus, so the first week of January, good with everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=9053)|
| 2:30:58| January the 7th, if it's available, will you check, Jolie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=9058)|
| 2:31:01| Wednesday the 7th at 4 o'clock, and we'll start that process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=9061)|
| 2:31:05| I'll be out of town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=9065)|
| 2:31:06| You'll be out of town?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=9066)|
| 2:31:09| You'll be back that week, or you – do you know if you're back that week, or is that –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=9069)|
| 2:31:24| Does anyone have Jeopardy theme music?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=9084)|
| 2:31:26| January 7th is the proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=9086)|
| 2:31:28| He's saying he's out of town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=9088)|
| 2:31:29| We're going to try to – I didn't hear what you said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=9089)|
| 2:31:31| Are you dogging me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=9091)|
| 2:31:38| I probably won't be back in town until the 11th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=9098)|
| 2:31:43| Are you going to be gone the 5th, Monday the 5th?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=9103)|
| 2:31:46| Monday the 5th?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=9106)|
| 2:31:47| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=9107)|
| 2:31:49| Yeah, we'll probably leave the 1st usually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=9109)|
| 2:31:53| Depends on the weather.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=9113)|
| 2:31:57| Is it the 12th?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=9117)|
| 2:31:58| You'll be back on the 11th?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=9118)|
| 2:32:01| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=9121)|
| 2:32:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=9123)|
| 2:32:06| We'll check on the 12th, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=9126)|
| 2:32:07| It's a Monday the 12th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=9127)|
| 2:32:08| That's our workshop day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=9128)|
| 2:32:10| Oh, is it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=9130)|
| 2:32:11| Oh, that's a week away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=9131)|
| 2:32:12| Not in January.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=9132)|
| 2:32:13| It won't be a week before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=9133)|
| 2:32:15| Is everybody in town on the 12th?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=9135)|
| 2:32:19| That's not a holiday, is it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=9139)|
| 2:32:20| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=9140)|
| 2:32:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=9141)|
| 2:32:22| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=9142)|
| 2:32:23| We'll check on January the 12th, and we'll get it out to everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=9143)|
| 2:32:25| I think it's a birthday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=9145)|
| 2:32:27| It's not, unfortunately, not a holiday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=9147)|
| 2:32:31| One more item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=9151)|
| 2:32:33| Discussion regarding increasing the beer fines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=9153)|
| 2:32:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=9159)|
| 2:32:47| Over the last six years of sitting here, we have seen repeaters, repeaters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=9167)|
| 2:32:56| And in six years, I think we talked about this once before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=9176)|
| 2:33:01| I've never seen anybody turn down the fine for a suspension, a three-day suspension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=9181)|
| 2:33:07| Ultimately, the buck stops with the owner of the business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=9187)|
| 2:33:12| And it's the owner of the business' responsibility to see that their employees comply with all the state and local laws.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=9192)|
| 2:33:20| So we may need to consider to do something to get a little more of their attention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=9200)|
| 2:33:28| It seems that the only place that we can really hurt them is getting their pocketbook.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=9208)|
| 2:33:33| I mean, I know we can say, well, they're not, it wasn't their fault.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=9213)|
| 2:33:37| Well, you know, your dog goes to the neighbor's yard and bites them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=9217)|
| 2:33:44| It's your fault.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=9224)|
| 2:33:48| So I'm thinking that we need to maybe induce some increasing in beer board fines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=9228)|
| 2:33:55| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=9235)|
| 2:33:56| By state law, Mr. Law Director, as far as what we can do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=9236)|
| 2:34:00| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=9240)|
| 2:34:02| Right now, under your current ordinances, what you all are doing is being more tradition of the board rather than statutory requirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=9242)|
| 2:34:10| You've been using the proverb vendor, you know, segment of your teeth, if you will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=9250)|
| 2:34:20| However, for any civil fine related to beer, you have a $1,000 limit for any civil fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=9260)|
| 2:34:26| However, for selling to minors, you have a maximum selling of $2,500.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=9266)|
| 2:34:32| It doesn't have to be a first offense, second offense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=9272)|
| 2:34:34| I mean, you can do what you want to do at the moment you want to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=9274)|
| 2:34:39| What you all have traditionally done is followed the preferred vendor table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=9279)|
| 2:34:46| But you don't have to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=9286)|
| 2:34:48| And $500 and $1,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=9288)|
| 2:34:49| You can go $2,500 first offense, pop, and you're done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=9289)|
| 2:34:54| Well, I'd like to hear some of the others comment here on what their feelings are because I think this is something probably we just have to go to the rules committee and come back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=9294)|
| 2:35:01| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=9301)|
| 2:35:02| No, you already have the power.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=9302)|
| 2:35:03| You can set that fine in the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=9303)|
| 2:35:04| You can say $750 instead of $500.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=9304)|
| 2:35:09| It's up to us as a commission to agree, six of us to agree on that fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=9309)|
| 2:35:14| So what some of the rest of you think before we put it on the agenda for next month?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=9314)|
| 2:35:19| Well, you don't put it on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=9319)|
| 2:35:20| I mean, we don't have set in stone first time offense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=9320)|
| 2:35:24| We've just been using the customary $500.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=9324)|
| 2:35:27| I don't think it's set in stone unless they're a preferred vendor from the state, which there's not any left because Rocky Top left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=9327)|
| 2:35:33| Rocky Top Markets were the only preferred vendor in the state, so nobody in Knox County is a preferred vendor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=9333)|
| 2:35:38| So what you're saying is, but for us to change it, we have to vote on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=9338)|
| 2:35:43| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=9343)|
| 2:35:44| The next board meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=9344)|
| 2:35:45| You can get mad at somebody and say $750.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=9345)|
| 2:35:48| If the rest of the commission agrees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=9348)|
| 2:35:50| Try it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=9350)|
| 2:35:51| Six of them agree, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=9351)|
| 2:35:52| You've got to get five friends, Brownie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=9352)|
| 2:35:56| But, I mean, there is no first offense, second offense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=9356)|
| 2:35:59| You can say $1,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=9359)|
| 2:36:00| You can say $1,500.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=9360)|
| 2:36:02| And, of course, they can appeal and chance to report, but we've had that done before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=9362)|
| 2:36:06| Well, do we need to surprise them or do we need to make some kind of notification?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=9366)|
| 2:36:13| I mean, if you think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=9373)|
| 2:36:14| Director, are we required?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=9374)|
| 2:36:15| During the beer board meeting, if you feel like it's important that we set a minimum first, we can set a minimum first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=9375)|
| 2:36:22| But then you're tying your hands because there's times where we did a letter of compliance instead of a minimum first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=9382)|
| 2:36:29| We've done that before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=9389)|
| 2:36:30| What you're saying is better to do it on an individual basis but increase them where we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=9390)|
| 2:36:36| If you're.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=9396)|
| 2:36:37| If a mood hits you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=9397)|
| 2:36:39| Well, not a mood, but if there's reasoning behind it, I would imagine we could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=9399)|
| 2:36:43| Or we could send a letter from the beer board to the beer vendors that we're considering an increase in first time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=9403)|
| 2:36:49| or traditional is $500, we're considering an increase in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=9409)|
| 2:36:52| Be aware.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=9412)|
| 2:36:53| Nothing wrong with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=9413)|
| 2:36:54| If we send a letter to the vendors and they in turn can notify their customers, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=9414)|
| 2:37:05| Not the vendors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=9425)|
| 2:37:06| I'm talking about the applicant beer permit holders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=9426)|
| 2:37:08| Vendors are out of the loop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=9428)|
| 2:37:10| That's a lot of letters to send them to every applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=9430)|
| 2:37:14| There's only a couple hundred.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=9434)|
| 2:37:16| That's the only way to get it done, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=9436)|
| 2:37:19| Commissioner Brantley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=9439)|
| 2:37:23| I'm sorry, Commissioner Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=9443)|
| 2:37:26| Yes, from talking to some of the people that do the enforcement on this, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=9446)|
| 2:37:33| they're comfortable with us having an understanding that we're going to start at $750.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=9453)|
| 2:37:38| And I think, I hope that, well, from now on when we have somebody that comes in here and breaks the law,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=9458)|
| 2:37:44| I'm going to recommend at least $750 on first offense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=9464)|
| 2:37:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=9467)|
| 2:37:48| Hey, Brown, she said that we're sending out that $100 a year beer privilege tax that they pay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=9468)|
| 2:37:55| We send a letter out for that and we can put it in that letter if you want to think we ought to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=9475)|
| 2:38:01| We can take it up next month at the beer board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=9481)|
| 2:38:02| Have you already sent it out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=9482)|
| 2:38:03| When did you send it out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=9483)|
| 2:38:07| Well, can we do that by agreement here at a discussion item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=9487)|
| 2:38:12| We can agree on the letter, but.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=9492)|
| 2:38:18| It's all discretionary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=9498)|
| 2:38:20| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=9500)|
| 2:38:21| And you can put them on notice that you may be imposing at this board's discretion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=9501)|
| 2:38:26| higher fines in the first offense than they've been normally used to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=9506)|
| 2:38:31| The other issue that you haven't discussed is you've always given them an option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=9511)|
| 2:38:35| I mean, it's like $530 or $1,060 days suspension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=9515)|
| 2:38:40| Well, if you're going to go to $750, you're talking about a 45-day suspension or, you know, it's totally discretionary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=9520)|
| 2:38:48| The only thing that's not discretionary is $2,500 as you're sealing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=9528)|
| 2:38:54| You could go $2,500 every time if you wanted to for first offense, second offense, third offense into oblivion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=9534)|
| 2:39:00| The little table that you use and are used to using is a discretionary table for this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=9540)|
| 2:39:06| Even in your MUNI code, even in our code, it says it's discretionary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=9546)|
| 2:39:12| So I do recall the chairman mentioned, you know, one time, I forget the circumstance, you all sent a letter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=9552)|
| 2:39:19| And it was enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=9559)|
| 2:39:20| I mean, you know, for that fact pattern, it was pretty enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=9560)|
| 2:39:25| Then there are other times, you know, that you've let them go for $500 when $2,500 might have been better, but that's discretionary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=9565)|
| 2:39:33| So where you really are, and I think Brad's kind of tried to say this, is that whatever you put on the table, six votes will get it done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=9573)|
| 2:39:43| All you need is to make a motion, six votes will get it done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=9583)|
| 2:39:46| And that's your discretion, but you can't go over $2,500.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=9586)|
| 2:39:50| And if you suspend their license for a year, then if it's suspended, it's done at that site for a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=9590)|
| 2:40:00| See what I'm saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=9600)|
| 2:40:01| Nobody else can come in and open and get a license for that address either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=9601)|
| 2:40:05| So you're also kicking the landlord if you hit a suspension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=9605)|
| 2:40:11| But every bit of that's at the discretion of this body based on the facts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=9611)|
| 2:40:15| This is a judiciary, quasi-judiciary body, and we're having these bare board hearings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=9615)|
| 2:40:21| It's just like a court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=9621)|
| 2:40:23| And you have the discretion to, you know, to institute any punishment up to $2,500 that you want to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=9623)|
| 2:40:31| You don't even have to give an option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=9631)|
| 2:40:32| You can suspend it 30 days and $2,500 if you want to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=9632)|
| 2:40:36| It's entirely up to six votes of this board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=9636)|
| 2:40:39| So you have a tremendous amount of power.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=9639)|
| 2:40:42| What we've used to be, you know, we're just used to doing it, and we just did it, I think, as a body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=9642)|
| 2:40:48| But you don't have to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=9648)|
| 2:40:51| Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=9651)|
| 2:40:52| It's already there for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=9652)|
| 2:40:54| Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=9654)|
| 2:40:55| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=9655)|
| 2:40:56| One of the things that enters into this also is that you take your rather large wholly owned local grocery store,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=9656)|
| 2:41:06| and the owner, due to the size of the business and the hours of operation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=9666)|
| 2:41:11| may have a lot of people that are dealing with the sale of beer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=9671)|
| 2:41:16| or in this instance we're talking about here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=9676)|
| 2:41:20| One of the discussions that's taken place is how do we get a heavier penalty on the actual person that did the violation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=9680)|
| 2:41:29| I believe we've mentioned the landlord may not even be involved in the business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=9689)|
| 2:41:37| And some of our rules punish that person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=9697)|
| 2:41:40| The owner of a business, though, that's selling beer should have better control of its employees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=9700)|
| 2:41:47| but if they've got 15 or 20 and you plug in any name, brand, beer seller,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=9707)|
| 2:41:55| they have a little bit of trouble controlling their employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=9715)|
| 2:41:59| And some of that discussion that we've tried to hold in the past doesn't really get anywhere| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=9719)|
| 2:42:06| because they're cited to court, criminal court, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=9726)|
| 2:42:12| Sessions Court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=9732)|
| 2:42:14| Sessions Court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=9734)|
| 2:42:15| Well, it's criminal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=9735)|
| 2:42:16| It's the bottom of Sessions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=9736)|
| 2:42:17| It's a criminal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=9737)|
| 2:42:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=9738)|
| 2:42:19| And they may get into a circumstance where it's a first-time offense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=9739)|
| 2:42:25| They, you know, plead no contest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=9745)|
| 2:42:30| I'll not do it again in 90 days or I'll not do it again in a year and a half and you clean my record up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=9750)|
| 2:42:36| That individual that actually made the sale,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=9756)|
| 2:42:39| the person that has actually caused us to have something standing here in front of us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=9759)|
| 2:42:45| no longer involved in the business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=9765)|
| 2:42:49| and the person didn't really get much of a penalty for what they did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=9769)|
| 2:42:53| So as we're talking about this, it's all balancing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=9773)|
| 2:42:58| And if we want to move to the $750 on the more egregious first-time offenses, I'm all for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=9778)|
| 2:43:05| It's just that we have to, I don't think we need to limit ourselves to saying $750 is the first offense| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=9785)|
| 2:43:11| because, as we've already noted, we've had one offense that had no fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=9791)|
| 2:43:17| So it's whatever we want to do on every individual case that comes before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=9797)|
| 2:43:22| I think that's where we ought to stay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=9802)|
| 2:43:23| Well, one thing you mentioned was, you know, the fines on the other end,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=9803)|
| 2:43:27| and we had, I think I'd mentioned it to you possibly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=9807)|
| 2:43:30| but maybe we should ask the judges to come to our, you know, luncheon workshop and discuss some of these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=9810)|
| 2:43:39| and say, you know, are they limited by state law what they can do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=9819)|
