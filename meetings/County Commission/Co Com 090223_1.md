| 2:25:26| to purchase. And governments have the right to put out property with options to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=8726)|
| 2:25:30| purchase. It's not a one-way track. We're not locked into anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=8730)|
| 2:25:34| And we're being asked if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=8734)|
| 2:25:38| we can allow our partner to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=8738)|
| 2:25:42| sublease some property to increase their cash flow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=8742)|
| 2:25:46| None of these things are unreasonable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=8746)|
| 2:25:50| in the current climate in which we find ourselves. I cannot speak| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=8750)|
| 2:25:54| for the other commissioners at this table. I can only speak for Bud Armstrong and the people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=8754)|
| 2:25:58| in the 8th District who have talked to me at length| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=8758)|
| 2:26:02| on the telephone and personally| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=8762)|
| 2:26:06| about the good job that Hillcrest has done for their mother and their parents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=8766)|
| 2:26:10| and so on and so on. I cannot just go on about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=8770)|
| 2:26:14| And I am here to represent them. And I am inclined to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=8774)|
| 2:26:18| relieve the pain to a certain degree because I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=8778)|
| 2:26:22| by this uncertainty, nobody wants to invest in a business that can go away on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=8782)|
| 2:26:26| a 60-day notice. And that's part of our problem. We've created| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=8786)|
| 2:26:30| that problem for our partner. And they're saying, can you give us some relief| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=8790)|
| 2:26:34| from that? I'm inclined to say we should.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=8794)|
| 2:26:38| I just want Hillcrest and the people in this community to know where Bud Armstrong stands| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=8798)|
| 2:26:42| on the city. I'm inclined to make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=8802)|
| 2:26:52| I'm inclined to make a motion that we accept this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=8812)|
| 2:26:56| and help our partners serve our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=8816)|
| 2:27:00| community and serve our elderly if we're willing to serve all the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=8820)|
| 2:27:04| other social people who are coming into our community as immigrants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=8824)|
| 2:27:08| I'm not going to put our people at risk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=8828)|
| 2:27:12| And that's what we're saying. We don't know what we can do, who will go, where we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=8832)|
| 2:27:16| won't go. I'm inclined to believe that the state will take care of them, move them where they need to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=8836)|
| 2:27:20| to be protected, whatever we do. And I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=8840)|
| 2:27:24| we need to help our citizens and give| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=8844)|
| 2:27:28| ourselves some breathing room and give this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=8848)|
| 2:27:32| service provider some breathing room to take| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=8852)|
| 2:27:36| care of our people. Now, whether they buy it in the future or whether they don't buy it in the future,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=8856)|
| 2:27:40| that's dessert for another day. But our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=8860)|
| 2:27:44| immediate need is to relieve the pain and take care of our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=8864)|
| 2:27:48| elderly and give them some semblance of peace of mind,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=8868)|
| 2:27:52| for Pete's sake, and care. As they had before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=8872)|
| 2:27:56| we started this ball rolling back in November.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=8876)|
| 2:28:00| And this sense of uncertainty is expensive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=8880)|
| 2:28:04| And I think, I'm with Commissioner Lutho here, we do need to make a decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=8884)|
| 2:28:08| We need to make one today. I'm just letting you know where my decision is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=8888)|
| 2:28:12| And I thank every one of you for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=8892)|
| 2:28:16| I believe I'm supposed to get the floor back, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=8896)|
| 2:28:20| No, Mr. Chairman, there are other lights on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=8900)|
| 2:28:24| I'm running this. Commissioner Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=8904)|
| 2:28:28| Thank you, Mr. Chairman, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=8908)|
| 2:28:32| You know, I think that this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=8912)|
| 2:28:36| decision that we face I think has been the toughest one that I've had since I've been on here the last| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=8916)|
| 2:28:40| 13 months. And in some ways it's rather than| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=8920)|
| 2:28:44| a win-win situation, it may be a lose-lose situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=8924)|
| 2:28:48| And I think that absolutely| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=8928)|
| 2:28:52| the first and only consideration has to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=8932)|
| 2:28:56| what's best for the patients out there. That's the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=8936)|
| 2:29:00| first consideration. And the secondary consideration deals with the employees and then also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=8940)|
| 2:29:04| the taxpayers have an interest in this also that we don't burden them with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=8944)|
| 2:29:08| One of the things that we can't do, I don't think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=8948)|
| 2:29:12| is we can't let Hillcrest just close and then disperse| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=8952)|
| 2:29:16| the patients, sell the facility, and then come back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=8956)|
| 2:29:20| If you really wanted to know what my preference would be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=8960)|
| 2:29:24| it would be for us to go through the bidding process, let| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=8964)|
| 2:29:28| companies come in here, see what they have to offer according| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=8968)|
| 2:29:32| to the minimum requirements that we would put on the bid,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=8972)|
| 2:29:36| and then let the person that we think can best management, make the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=8976)|
| 2:29:40| improvements that we need to see, take over running| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=8980)|
| 2:29:44| the facility. And I would make clear the place would probably still be called| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=8984)|
| 2:29:48| Hillcrest. We're not eliminating Hillcrest. We're just letting another management| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=8988)|
| 2:29:52| company come in. One of the problems that I see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=8992)|
| 2:29:56| with what Commissioner Lambert said, and he and I agree on some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=8996)|
| 2:30:00| things and we disagree on a lot of things, but I'm not sure that we can put| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=9000)|
| 2:30:04| this out to the open bid process because I don't think we have the six or eight months time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=9004)|
| 2:30:08| to do it. If we do that, and I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=9008)|
| 2:30:12| really believe you when you say that we're running into a cash flow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=9012)|
| 2:30:16| problem, is that finally you wouldn't be able to make your payroll, you'd have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=9016)|
| 2:30:20| to notify the state and then the patients would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=9020)|
| 2:30:24| dispersed. I don't think that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=9024)|
| 2:30:28| good. What we have to decide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=9028)|
| 2:30:32| is not only the short-term solution, which would be to approve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=9032)|
| 2:30:36| the contract, but we also have to look at the long-term| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=9036)|
| 2:30:40| what's best for the elderly patient.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=9040)|
| 2:30:44| And that's, I think, what we're going to have to decide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=9044)|
| 2:30:48| today. Do we think it's better to sell the place, maybe have more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=9048)|
| 2:30:52| capital come in that can actually improve things over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=9052)|
| 2:30:56| there or to deal with what's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=9056)|
| 2:31:00| proposed today? One of the things that if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=9060)|
| 2:31:04| Hillcrest just closed and then was sold, I really don't think you would have that much trouble| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=9064)|
| 2:31:08| getting a certificate of need because the certificate of need really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=9068)|
| 2:31:12| represents the number of beds that's needed for this type of patients in East Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=9072)|
| 2:31:16| So they would get it, but the problem is that the patients would all be gone and I don't know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=9076)|
| 2:31:20| if we want to put everyone through that or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=9080)|
| 2:31:24| It's a hard decision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=9084)|
| 2:31:28| and I think each of us are just going to have to decide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=9088)|
| 2:31:32| I don't think there's a right or wrong answer. I don't think it's necessarily a win-win, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=9092)|
| 2:31:36| I think we're just going to have to each individual| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=9096)|
| 2:31:40| commissioner is going to have to decide what they think is best.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=9100)|
| 2:31:44| I'll stop right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=9104)|
| 2:31:48| Commissioner Brown. Yes, I'd like to echo what Commissioner Armstrong said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=9108)|
| 2:31:52| I've had the occasion of having four different relatives| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=9112)|
| 2:31:56| that I've had power of attorney for that have gone through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=9116)|
| 2:32:00| three different nursing home| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=9120)|
| 2:32:04| facilities in the area and I'll tell you this, that the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=9124)|
| 2:32:08| first was the best experience that I had with either one of the four of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=9128)|
| 2:32:12| We talk about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=9132)|
| 2:32:16| what bad times they've had in the past. None of us can live in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=9136)|
| 2:32:20| I think the current management has shown that they have turned things around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=9140)|
| 2:32:24| We're in economic times right now where we can't forecast| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=9144)|
| 2:32:28| six months, a year down the road what's going to happen to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=9148)|
| 2:32:32| any one of us or any business at this point, but I feel like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=9152)|
| 2:32:36| Commissioner Armstrong and several others have mentioned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=9156)|
| 2:32:40| the last thing I would ever do would be try to put 560 people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=9160)|
| 2:32:44| out on the street. I favor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=9164)|
| 2:32:48| that we extend this lease and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=9168)|
| 2:32:52| let them have a chance to bring in a partner that can put some money into it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=9172)|
| 2:32:56| that can turn the business around or continue because I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=9176)|
| 2:33:00| they were on the right path and I think we owe them that opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=9180)|
| 2:33:04| We not only owe Hillcrest an opportunity, but most importantly we owe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=9184)|
| 2:33:08| the residents, the staff and the people of Knox County that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=9188)|
| 2:33:20| Commissioner Wright and then I'm coming to you, Commissioner Pinkston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=9200)|
| 2:33:24| Commissioner Wright. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=9204)|
| 2:33:28| I do not rise to speak for or against whatever| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=9208)|
| 2:33:32| it is we're talking about. I rise to speak in that we've spent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=9212)|
| 2:33:36| several, several minutes, several| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=9216)|
| 2:33:40| five-minute presenters and I don't think we have something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=9220)|
| 2:33:44| on the floor in front of us unless there is a motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=9224)|
| 2:33:48| beside me. And if that is true, that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=9228)|
| 2:33:52| do have a motion before us, I would like to see us for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=9232)|
| 2:33:56| current time then focus on whatever| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=9236)|
| 2:34:00| it is that we're deciding and try to move away from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=9240)|
| 2:34:04| the talking about the global crisis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=9244)|
| 2:34:08| and speak to what might| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=9248)|
| 2:34:12| specifically be before us as a motion. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=9252)|
| 2:34:16| Commissioner Pinkston. Yes, first of all, I want to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=9256)|
| 2:34:20| thank the administration and everybody in the South| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=9260)|
| 2:34:24| Knox Hillcrest. If they all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=9264)|
| 2:34:28| were run like that, there wouldn't be any problem with Hillcrest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=9268)|
| 2:34:32| They don't have anything on them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=9272)|
| 2:34:36| since 2004 where there was anybody in immediate jeopardy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=9276)|
| 2:34:40| like North and West has had. If there's anybody here from South,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=9280)|
| 2:34:44| I just want you to know and I appreciate it. I'm not in the one to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=9284)|
| 2:34:48| sell in Hillcrest. I wasn't the one that bought it up. Contrary to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=9288)|
| 2:34:52| what Mr. Armstrong said, it's not being sold for county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=9292)|
| 2:34:56| debts because of what the county is in it. Contrary to what Mr. Armstrong says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=9296)|
| 2:35:00| we're not in partnership with Hillcrest. All we do is lease them a building for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=9300)|
| 2:35:04| $1. Contrary to what Mr. Armstrong says, we take| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=9304)|
| 2:35:08| care of our elderly through TennCare. You pay taxes. We do that with every| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=9308)|
| 2:35:12| nursing home in the state of Tennessee that receives TennCare.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=9312)|
| 2:35:16| That's through your taxes. The others have the same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=9316)|
| 2:35:20| I don't want Hillcrest to close. I want to protect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=9320)|
| 2:35:24| these people. I am being made to look like the bad guy, but we've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=9324)|
| 2:35:28| got 600 people here that may lose their jobs. We've got 500| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=9328)|
| 2:35:32| patients that may be out on the street. We have to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=9332)|
| 2:35:36| do something. Now, I am not for extending this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=9336)|
| 2:35:40| contract, but I will do this. I will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=9340)|
| 2:35:44| withdraw this motion to put this out for bids,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=9344)|
| 2:35:48| keep the lease for two years, and if Hillcrest can show| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=9348)|
| 2:35:52| that they can turn this thing around, they have to show some good effort| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=9352)|
| 2:35:56| to get an extension on the lease or anything, and so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=9356)|
| 2:36:00| far I haven't seen it. For the last eight years, all they've done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=9360)|
| 2:36:04| is run through their money out there. That's all they've done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=9364)|
| 2:36:08| There have been no holes on it at all. They've run through,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=9368)|
| 2:36:12| like I said, $30 million. $16 million of that was in a savings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=9372)|
| 2:36:16| account. Now, they're coming up with a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=9376)|
| 2:36:20| $2.6 million saving. What is your plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=9380)|
| 2:36:24| Has anyone here received a plan that Hillcrest says is doable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=9384)|
| 2:36:28| with their partner? Have you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=9388)|
| 2:36:32| shown anyone this plan, Ms. Poynter? You're quoted in the paper| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=9392)|
| 2:36:36| that y'all have a plan that the experts have agreed is doable. Now, I don't know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=9396)|
| 2:36:40| who the experts are or what the plan is. We have a strategic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=9400)|
| 2:36:44| plan that was board approved last June. We began implementing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=9404)|
| 2:36:48| and as you saw in the graph in the presentation by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=9408)|
| 2:36:52| Mr. Bell, that resulted in an increase of census in October| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=9412)|
| 2:36:56| to 90% from the prior 84%. It has since| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=9416)|
| 2:37:00| declined to 84% again with all of this attention and instability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=9420)|
| 2:37:04| Yes, our plan was working, Mr. Pinkston. I do have, and I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=9424)|
| 2:37:08| can have my assistant back here give you an outline| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=9428)|
| 2:37:12| of what our strategic plan includes. If you'd like to have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=9432)|
| 2:37:16| that document, we can bring it to the table for you. I think that every commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=9436)|
| 2:37:20| up here should see that plan, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=9440)|
| 2:37:24| Another thing I want to ask you now is if we extend this lease,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=9444)|
| 2:37:28| we've got no assurance that someone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=9448)|
| 2:37:32| will partner with you. I have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=9452)|
| 2:37:36| a document from a partner who has requested| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=9456)|
| 2:37:40| confidentiality until such time I have a secure lease,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=9460)|
| 2:37:44| a more stable lease in place. I have a document, I have a board executive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=9464)|
| 2:37:48| committee meeting tomorrow to review that document contingent upon your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=9468)|
| 2:37:52| all's decision today, and I have a full board meeting scheduled Thursday to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=9472)|
| 2:37:56| also review with that potential partner in town| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=9476)|
| 2:38:00| to come into town and review that with the full board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=9480)|
| 2:38:04| in the event your all's decision today allows| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=9484)|
| 2:38:08| stability to my lease.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=9488)|
| 2:38:12| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=9492)|
| 2:38:16| How do we know that they will go through this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=9496)|
| 2:38:20| We don't. And you're asking us to extend| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=9500)|
| 2:38:24| this lease to 2019.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=9504)|
| 2:38:28| I'm asking you for stability in my lease so that that partner will come back to the table| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=9508)|
| 2:38:32| with me and we can work out the details of a deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=9512)|
| 2:38:36| Is this a nonprofit organization| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=9516)|
| 2:38:40| or a for-profit organization? We have talked to many. The partner that we are meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=9520)|
| 2:38:44| with most routinely has a for-profit arm and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=9524)|
| 2:38:48| a not-for-profit arm, and the not-for-profit organizations in which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=9528)|
| 2:38:52| they've already acquired or partnered with remain managed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=9532)|
| 2:38:56| under the not-for-profit arm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=9536)|
| 2:39:00| I'm going to make a motion. We already have one motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=9540)|
| 2:39:04| You can have a substitute motion. Make a substitute motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=9544)|
| 2:39:08| that we withdraw this, let Hillcrest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=9548)|
| 2:39:12| keep this until 2012, let them show| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=9552)|
| 2:39:16| some kind of effort to turn this around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=9556)|
| 2:39:24| And give them, if we have to even take it from a fund balance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=9564)|
| 2:39:28| give them this $100,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=9568)|
| 2:39:32| a month for one year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=9572)|
| 2:39:36| which would be the $1.2 million of our fund balance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=9576)|
| 2:39:40| but give it to them at $100,000 a month until they show us that they are turning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=9580)|
| 2:39:44| something around before we even look at extending anything. And if they don't,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=9584)|
| 2:39:48| then in 2012 we put this thing back up for sale. Now that's my| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=9588)|
| 2:39:52| substitute motion. That's our second, if you'll accept a friendly amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=9592)|
| 2:39:56| What is a friendly amendment? Instead of us giving them the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=9596)|
| 2:40:00| $100,000, what did you say, a month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=9600)|
| 2:40:04| that we allow them to sublease the property? That way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=9604)|
| 2:40:08| we don't have to pull money out of their pocket to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=9608)|
| 2:40:12| supplement them. We supplement them by allowing them to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=9612)|
| 2:40:16| sublease the properties. And anything over $100,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=9616)|
| 2:40:20| a month that they're able to sublease, then we split that with them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=9620)|
| 2:40:24| in the future. But, Ms. Poynter, pardon me just a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=9624)|
| 2:40:28| Did you say South was one of them you were going to sublease? No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=9628)|
| 2:40:32| My primary intent initially would be to sublease| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=9632)|
| 2:40:36| the already vacant space in the Weaver Building on the North Campus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=9636)|
| 2:40:40| There's already 25,000 square feet vacated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=9640)|
| 2:40:44| empty, that needs to be used and could benefit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=9644)|
| 2:40:48| from subleasing. I do not have those arrangements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=9648)|
| 2:40:52| made, Mr. Lambert, so there could be an issue with timing on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=9652)|
| 2:40:56| getting folks moved in and getting a check coming. Do you think you could live with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=9656)|
| 2:41:00| what I've proposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=9660)|
| 2:41:04| I would have to say probably no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=9664)|
| 2:41:08| You mean if we gave you the $1.2 million you still can't make it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=9668)|
| 2:41:12| If you gave us $1.2 million right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=9672)|
| 2:41:16| we might can make it. If you give us $100,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=9676)|
| 2:41:20| right now. All right, I'll make it that. We'll give you the $1.2 million. I'll make a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=9680)|
| 2:41:24| Substitute motion. Give you $1.2 million right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=9684)|
| 2:41:28| Take it out of our fund balance, which I hate to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=9688)|
| 2:41:32| But in a year's time, if you haven't shown| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=9692)|
| 2:41:36| something that you're reversing this situation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=9696)|
| 2:41:40| then we don't give you any more money and we look at selling this building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=9700)|
| 2:41:44| these facilities. It's up to you to turn this around, sir. We've got no| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=9704)|
| 2:41:48| control over it. Matter of fact is, it seems to me like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=9708)|
| 2:41:52| now that when the grand jury stopped going out there in 2000 is when Hillcrest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=9712)|
| 2:41:56| really got in trouble. Well, if I could just make a couple| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=9716)|
| 2:42:00| comments about that. First of all, I don't exactly know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=9720)|
| 2:42:04| how this got to be adversarial. You know, we didn't come| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=9724)|
| 2:42:08| in here as an adversary to the county. Oh, I understand. We came| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=9728)|
| 2:42:12| in here originally because we were invited to come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=9732)|
| 2:42:16| Now, we're in a position| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=9736)|
| 2:42:20| where we still are not adversarial. We, Hillcrest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=9740)|
| 2:42:24| has never said we will not partner with the county and put| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=9744)|
| 2:42:28| the licensed beds and the real estate together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=9748)|
| 2:42:32| to sell it. We never said that. But we were never| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=9752)|
| 2:42:36| asked to do that either. We have never been asked to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=9756)|
| 2:42:40| It has always been the county is going to sell the land. We don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=9760)|
| 2:42:44| care about the license. Now, we're in a position where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=9764)|
| 2:42:48| we have done everything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=9768)|
| 2:42:52| and Carolyn Pointer and the other executives have done everything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=9772)|
| 2:42:56| they can to figure a way out of this. And what this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=9776)|
| 2:43:00| lease change does is allows us to find| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=9780)|
| 2:43:04| basically a company that will finance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=9784)|
| 2:43:08| in the neighborhood of about $5 million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=9788)|
| 2:43:12| but in order to do that, they want enough time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=9792)|
| 2:43:16| to make sure they recover their investment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=9796)|
| 2:43:20| And they can't recover their investment in 60 days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=9800)|
| 2:43:24| or one year. And they do it in two years?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=9804)|
| 2:43:28| No. They can't show that you're going to make a profit in two years?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=9808)|
| 2:43:32| Well, they can probably show that they can make a profit, but they can't make enough profit to pay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=9812)|
| 2:43:36| themselves back in two years. So that's why we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=9816)|
| 2:43:40| need a lease extension that can't be canceled| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=9820)|
| 2:43:44| in this time period. So this is not about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=9824)|
| 2:43:48| Hillcrest buying your property. We're not trying to buy anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=9828)|
| 2:43:52| We're just trying to stay in business. I understand. Now I'm trying to help you stay in business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=9832)|
| 2:43:56| by offering you $1.2 million. But let me ask you this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=9836)|
| 2:44:00| Mr. Law Director, what if one of these other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=9840)|
| 2:44:04| nursing homes around come up here and say, hey, we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=9844)|
| 2:44:08| busted. We need money. We're obligated to them the same| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=9848)|
| 2:44:12| way that we are to Hillcrest because they take Medicaid and Medicare| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=9852)|
| 2:44:16| patients. Is that not correct? No, sir. We're not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=9856)|
| 2:44:20| We're not legally obligated to Hillcrest. That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=9860)|
| 2:44:24| The issue under discussion is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=9864)|
| 2:44:28| there has been a longstanding relationship| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=9868)|
| 2:44:32| between Knox County and Hillcrest. It is a not-for-profit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=9872)|
| 2:44:36| The others are not not-for-profit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=9876)|
| 2:44:40| But they do make a profit. They've made a profit for 40-some years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=9880)|
| 2:44:44| They've made a profit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=9884)|
| 2:44:48| What's out there right now, the administration that took over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=9888)|
| 2:44:52| in 2000, some of them have left, that is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=9892)|
| 2:44:56| when it went down. When I was doing the research| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=9896)|
| 2:45:00| that I was asked to do in talking with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=9900)|
| 2:45:04| officials with the state, with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=9904)|
| 2:45:08| regulatory board that oversees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=9908)|
| 2:45:12| issuance of certificates of need, they did discuss these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=9912)|
| 2:45:16| percentages of patient population in long-term| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=9916)|
| 2:45:20| facilities. And Hillcrest patient population in terms of Medicaid| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=9920)|
| 2:45:24| beds has always exceeded| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=9924)|
| 2:45:28| the Medicaid population in the other for-profit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=9928)|
| 2:45:32| facilities. And so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=9932)|
| 2:45:36| what we're talking about, and I think that's what this letter goes to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=9936)|
| 2:45:40| if there were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=9940)|
| 2:45:44| a forced closure of Hillcrest,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=9944)|
| 2:45:48| then that patient population could not be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=9948)|
| 2:45:52| absorbed locally. So you would have individuals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=9952)|
| 2:45:56| whose families, if they have families who live| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=9956)|
| 2:46:00| here locally, that patient population would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=9960)|
| 2:46:04| dispersed far and wide. They couldn't be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=9964)|
| 2:46:08| absorbed into the local community. So those people would have to be moved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=9968)|
| 2:46:12| to other parts of the state. But that would be if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=9972)|
| 2:46:16| whoever buys this doesn't get a certificate of need for that, doesn't it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=9976)|
| 2:46:20| Well, a certificate of need, as we said, if there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=9980)|
| 2:46:24| a sale, if Hillcrest sells the business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=9984)|
| 2:46:28| or agrees to an infusion of capital| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=9988)|
| 2:46:32| and there's a merger or an acquisition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=9992)|
| 2:46:36| then the certificate of need can be transferred in that instance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=9996)|
| 2:46:40| But that's the only way that the certificate of need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=10000)|
| 2:46:44| and the licenses can be transferred. But with all the restrictions like I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=10004)|
| 2:46:48| read there, what they have to do, you can bet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=10008)|
| 2:46:52| the state would issue a certificate of need for that, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=10012)|
| 2:46:56| Well, there are only 125 certificates of need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=10016)|
| 2:47:00| for long-term care facilities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=10020)|
| 2:47:04| statewide. That's it. And there's a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=10024)|
| 2:47:08| statewide plan that's put in place by the regulatory body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=10028)|
| 2:47:12| And they don't issue certificates of need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=10032)|
| 2:47:16| if it doesn't fit the formula in that statewide plan. And under that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=10036)|
| 2:47:20| formula, you're limited to those 125 certificates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=10040)|
| 2:47:24| of need. There's only 319 nursing homes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=10044)|
| 2:47:28| in the state of Tennessee, too. And Hillcrest is only one out of three| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=10048)|
| 2:47:32| that's ever been put in under SFF, Special Focus| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=10052)|
| 2:47:36| Facility. Mr. Chairman, we have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=10056)|
| 2:47:40| I'll call the question from his substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=10060)|
| 2:47:44| Well, I had a comment on the substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=10064)|
| 2:47:48| Well, we got a call for the question, but I didn't hear a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=10068)|
| 2:47:52| Second. Please state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=10072)|
| 2:47:56| the motion. Restate the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=10076)|
| 2:48:00| Substitute motion, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=10080)|
| 2:48:04| First, we need to vote on the call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=10084)|
| 2:48:08| Mr. Chairman, are we voting on the call to end debate or just to end debate on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=10088)|
| 2:48:12| End debate. Period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=10092)|
| 2:48:16| The call would only be for the substitute motion even if we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=10096)|
| 2:48:20| vote. Then we'd only be voting on the substitute motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=10100)|
| 2:48:24| after the vote on the call. And if that motion doesn't pass,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=10104)|
| 2:48:28| then we're just back to the original motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=10108)|
| 2:48:32| Does the substitute motion have a second? Yes, it does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=10112)|
| 2:48:36| Are we clear? Substitute motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=10116)|
| 2:48:40| had a second. Paul had a second. Yes, he did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=10120)|
| 2:48:44| Commissioner Lambert substituted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=10124)|
| 2:48:48| Are we clear this is on the call?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=10128)|
| 2:48:52| Starting in the ninth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=10132)|
| 2:48:56| Mr. Chairman, will you restate the motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=10136)|
| 2:49:00| Cut debate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=10140)|
| 2:49:04| I'll state it after, Tony. Cut debate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=10144)|
| 2:49:08| Commissioner Pinkston. Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=10148)|
| 2:49:12| Commissioner Brown. Aye. Commissioner Wright. Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=10152)|
| 2:49:16| Commissioner Armstrong. Aye. Commissioner Carringer. Aye. Commissioner Smith. Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=10156)|
| 2:49:20| Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=10160)|
| 2:49:24| Not to substitute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=10164)|
| 2:49:28| I was. Commissioner Anders. Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=10168)|
| 2:49:32| Commissioner Briggs. Let me ask,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=10172)|
| 2:49:36| are the people that have their lights on, they don't want to discuss this anymore, is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=10176)|
| 2:49:40| Not to substitute. Okay, I'll vote aye to vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=10180)|
| 2:49:44| Commissioner Luthold. No. Commissioner Hammond. Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=10184)|
| 2:49:48| Commissioner Schell. Aye. Commissioner Saunders. Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=10188)|
| 2:49:52| Mr. Ivan Harman. Aye. Commissioner Norman. Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=10192)|
| 2:49:56| Mr. Broyles. Aye. Mr. Mark Harmon. Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=10196)|
| 2:50:00| Mr. Strickland. No. Commissioner McKenzie. Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=10200)|
| 2:50:12| Motion passed. I've said I wanted to speak on the substitution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=10212)|
| 2:50:16| You all made the call, so we're ready to vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=10216)|
| 2:50:20| I want you to restate the substitute. I want you to repeat the substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=10220)|
| 2:50:24| The substitute motion is to give Hillcrest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=10224)|
| 2:50:28| $1.2 million if it has to be taken out of our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=10228)|
| 2:50:32| fund balance, which I hate to do that. Wait a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=10232)|
| 2:50:36| Wait just a minute. Repeat the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=10236)|
| 2:50:40| Take it out of the fund balance if we have to. Then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=10240)|
| 2:50:44| extend the lease. I withdraw the sale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=10244)|
| 2:50:48| Let them show us where they've made some concessions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=10248)|
| 2:50:52| in their losses out there and trying to turn this thing around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=10252)|
| 2:50:56| Is everyone clear?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=10256)|
| 2:51:00| I had a friendly amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=10260)|
| 2:51:04| contention on my seconding the motion, and that was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=10264)|
| 2:51:08| that instead of the $1.2 million, that we allow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=10268)|
| 2:51:12| them to make that $1.2 million by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=10272)|
| 2:51:16| extending the properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=10276)|
| 2:51:20| I didn't get a second, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=10280)|
| 2:51:24| My second was contention upon you accepting that friendly amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=10284)|
| 2:51:28| But you never said that. Oh, yeah, I said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=10288)|
| 2:51:32| I'll second if you'll accept the friendly amendment. Are you accepting it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=10292)|
| 2:51:36| I stated it. I don't think he ever accepted that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=10296)|
| 2:51:40| Are you accepting that, Commissioner Pinkston?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=10300)|
| 2:51:44| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=10304)|
| 2:51:48| I mean, you know, he asked a question, then I withdraw my second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=10308)|
| 2:51:52| I don't know if we've got $1.2 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=10312)|
| 2:51:56| Does Commissioner Pinkston have a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=10316)|
| 2:52:00| Does Commissioner Pinkston have a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=10320)|
| 2:52:04| We're back on the original motion. Did you get the original motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=10324)|
| 2:52:08| The original motion, Commissioner Armstrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=10328)|
| 2:52:12| The original motion was that we extend the lease to June 30th of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=10332)|
| 2:52:16| 2019, that we give them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=10336)|
| 2:52:20| a cause for termination,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=10340)|
| 2:52:24| that we provide a lease option for purchase at fair market value, which we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=10344)|
| 2:52:28| can do, and that we allow for subleasing of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=10348)|
| 2:52:32| space at Hillcrest. That was the motion that I put on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=10352)|
| 2:52:36| And Commissioner Hammond? I'll second the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=10356)|
| 2:52:40| Ready to vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=10360)|
| 2:52:48| Commissioner Smith, you're next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=10368)|
| 2:52:52| Question. Carolyn, can you come down real quick?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=10372)|
| 2:52:56| And Bud, this might be for you too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=10376)|
| 2:53:00| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=10380)|
| 2:53:04| Commissioner Armstrong, in the last one, the subleasing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=10384)|
| 2:53:08| was there that we also approve who the subleasing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=10388)|
| 2:53:12| is? Do we have any role in that, or would you be willing to add that to it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=10392)|
| 2:53:16| Our statement was that our subleasing would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=10396)|
| 2:53:20| with partners that have a purpose akin to our mission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=10400)|
| 2:53:24| if that language would be acceptable. Yeah, I was looking at something like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=10404)|
| 2:53:28| I will say this, Mr. Chairman, because I'm like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=10408)|
| 2:53:32| Commissioner Armstrong, I'm ready to vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=10412)|
| 2:53:36| Commissioner Porter, I believe in you. I think you're trying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=10416)|
| 2:53:40| to do the best that you can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=10420)|
| 2:53:48| I've been to your facilities in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=10428)|
| 2:53:52| 7th District that's your home base, and a lot of times I come unannounced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=10432)|
| 2:53:56| I have never heard one negative thing about you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=10436)|
| 2:54:00| My co-commissioner here, I know I have received a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=10440)|
| 2:54:04| whole lot of calls. I have not had one person say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=10444)|
| 2:54:08| to sell Hillcrest. Everybody in the 7th District, Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=10448)|
| 2:54:12| Armstrong, like you in the 8th, they're saying, hang on to it, hang on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=10452)|
| 2:54:16| to it. And I believe you're trying to turn this around| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=10456)|
| 2:54:20| and I want to give you the time to turn it around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=10460)|
| 2:54:24| Commissioners, we hold all the cards here. We've still got the buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=10464)|
| 2:54:28| If she goes belly up, we still have everything, and she is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=10468)|
| 2:54:32| her number one goal, like our goal is to take care of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=10472)|
| 2:54:36| the patients and take care of the employees. I believe in you, and good luck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=10476)|
| 2:54:46| Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=10486)|
| 2:54:50| Mr. Holt, Hugh Holt, could you come down, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=10490)|
| 2:54:54| Ms. Porter, before he gets down here, I just have, I too| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=10494)|
| 2:54:58| am fairly comfortable with the lease| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=10498)|
| 2:55:02| extension, but the 10-year, would 2015 be more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=10502)|
| 2:55:06| would it be acceptable, do you know of, for your partners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=10506)|
| 2:55:10| instead of 2019? I mean, that's in a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=10510)|
| 2:55:14| I think you can show where you've got it turned around, and also that partner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=10514)|
| 2:55:18| will know by that time that they're going to purchase the property if it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=10518)|
| 2:55:22| acceptable. That's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=10522)|
| 2:55:26| six years. I'm comfortable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=10526)|
| 2:55:30| with everything but the long term of the lease at a dollar, like Mr. Luthold said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=10530)|
| 2:55:34| If you're going to start making money on the buildings, then the dollar really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=10534)|
| 2:55:38| should be renegotiated somewhat, maybe a percentage of the lease property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=10538)|
| 2:55:42| You know, the county gets a percentage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=10542)|
| 2:55:46| of the rent based on the fact that you're getting the building virtually free.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=10546)|
| 2:55:50| But kind of think about the 2015 number, and I don't know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=10550)|
| 2:55:54| if it would take as a friendly amendment or not, but that's kind of, I don't mind voting for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=10554)|
| 2:55:58| the lease extension, but the length| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=10558)|
| 2:56:02| kind of concerns me. Go ahead. The potential partner that we've talked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=10562)|
| 2:56:06| to has requested a minimum of seven years, Mr. Andrew.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=10566)|
| 2:56:10| Okay. Hugh, can we, like Mr. Lambert| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=10570)|
| 2:56:14| was talking, can we give the leasee the option to purchase at the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=10574)|
| 2:56:18| end at fair market value? No, that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=10578)|
| 2:56:22| that's not allowable in the code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=10582)|
| 2:56:26| Disposition of real property happens three different ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=10586)|
| 2:56:30| One is through an RFP or a seal bid. The other is a public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=10590)|
| 2:56:34| auction. And the third would be a negotiated sale for the real property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=10594)|
| 2:56:38| But we have to conduct a market analysis to determine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=10598)|
| 2:56:42| if there's any other viable purchasers for that property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=10602)|
| 2:56:46| And I've already done that, and there are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=10606)|
| 2:56:50| If we could, Hugh, I bow to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=10610)|
| 2:56:54| your expertise on purchasing. But in terms of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=10614)|
| 2:56:58| performing a market analysis, and I haven't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=10618)|
| 2:57:02| seen it, and I'm not questioning you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=10622)|
| 2:57:06| at all, but there have been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=10626)|
| 2:57:10| representations made and others have appeared, and I think there are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=10630)|
| 2:57:14| some representatives present here today from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=10634)|
| 2:57:18| entities that have expressed interest. But| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=10638)|
| 2:57:22| we're talking about different| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=10642)|
| 2:57:26| things here. This is a governmental body. Those who have come| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=10646)|
| 2:57:30| here besides Hillcrest and expressed interest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=10650)|
| 2:57:34| in purchasing are in business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=10654)|
| 2:57:38| And oftentimes people who| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=10658)|
| 2:57:42| have business motives will act in the best interest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=10662)|
| 2:57:46| obviously of their business. Now, in terms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=10666)|
| 2:57:50| of a market analysis, if I understand correctly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=10670)|
| 2:57:54| in order for a negotiated sale to take place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=10674)|
| 2:57:58| a market analysis is performed and there has to be only one interested buyer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=10678)|
| 2:58:02| Is that correct? That's correct. Sometimes people will step| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=10682)|
| 2:58:06| forward and say they're interested, but they're not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=10686)|
| 2:58:10| That's correct. So in terms of verifying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=10690)|
| 2:58:14| that they are in fact an interested buyer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=10694)|
| 2:58:18| for our purposes, as Commissioner Lambert said, we're a governmental entity rather| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=10698)|
| 2:58:22| than simply accepting at face value their representations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=10702)|
| 2:58:26| And again, you may have already done this, but I think we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=10706)|
| 2:58:30| should at least require them to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=10710)|
| 2:58:34| come forward and show, give us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=10714)|
| 2:58:38| provide us a legally binding letter of intent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=10718)|
| 2:58:42| and demonstrate the wherewithal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=10722)|
| 2:58:46| to finance the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=10726)|
| 2:58:50| Currently, I don't have a letter of intent, but I did speak with three| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=10730)|
| 2:58:54| different providers. All three said they were interested, even though the issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=10734)|
| 2:58:58| that are out there surrounding the Hillcrest properties with a certificate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=10738)|
| 2:59:02| of needs and other issues, but I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=10742)|
| 2:59:06| can get a letter of intent from those three. I feel confident.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=10746)|
| 2:59:10| In order to do that, I think you and I would need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=10750)|
| 2:59:14| to work together so that whatever letter of intent they gave us would be one that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=10754)|
| 2:59:18| was, as I said, legally binding that would lock them in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=10758)|
| 2:59:22| so that they would be in breach if they didn't perform.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=10762)|
| 2:59:26| Yes. Mr. Armstrong,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=10766)|
| 2:59:30| could I ask you for a friendly amendment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=10770)|
| 2:59:34| The lease extension| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=10774)|
| 2:59:38| until 2016 and also provide the lease| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=10778)|
| 2:59:42| the, if it's okay with Ms. Poynter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=10782)|
| 2:59:46| subleasing space at 30% of the rent coming back to the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=10786)|
| 2:59:50| That way they don't have the free rent on four or five buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=10790)|
| 2:59:54| And if we can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=10794)|
| 2:59:58| work out the legalities, I don't care if they, this doesn't bother me that they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=10798)|
| 3:00:02| purchase at the end of the lease because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=10802)|
| 3:00:06| they've been providing the service for so long. That's not important to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=10806)|
| 3:00:10| For them to have five buildings for a dollar a year and to make money on top of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=10810)|
| 3:00:14| but at 2016 and 30% of the rent back to the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=10814)|
| 3:00:18| Mr. Anders, did you get that to 16 because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=10818)|
| 3:00:22| she said she needed seven years? Yes, sir, I did. Okay, I just want to be effective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=10822)|
| 3:00:26| That's a friendly amendment if you'll accept it. Is that agreeable?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=10826)|
| 3:00:30| Is that the stability that you would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=10830)|
| 3:00:34| I'd like to just make one comment in reference to the 30%| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=10834)|
| 3:00:38| sublease share. We are responsible for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=10838)|
| 3:00:42| all capital and operational maintenance of all the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=10842)|
| 3:00:46| facilities and for 2008, operational costs alone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=10846)|
| 3:00:50| just to keep up the buildings on the campuses was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=10850)|
| 3:00:54| $1.9 million. So we are expending| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=10854)|
| 3:00:58| many, many dollars to keep this county property up to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=10858)|
| 3:01:02| code and attractive enough for our folks to live in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=10862)|
| 3:01:06| and work out of. Commissioner Anders? Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=10866)|
| 3:01:10| I was thinking down the same lines as you as far as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=10870)|
| 3:01:14| receiving some money back on the sublease. I was thinking in the lines of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=10874)|
| 3:01:18| 15%. I'll take that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=10878)|
| 3:01:22| So 15%. If the maker of the motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=10882)|
| 3:01:26| would accept that. I'm thinking about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=10886)|
| 3:01:30| And I guess if not, there's still room for a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=10890)|
| 3:01:34| substitute motion. I want to make that point as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=10894)|
| 3:01:38| Commissioner Armstrong, I was just going to make the point that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=10898)|
| 3:01:42| it might be a more appropriate motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=10902)|
| 3:01:46| If I'm reading the room correctly, we want to work with Hillcrest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=10906)|
| 3:01:50| I am definitely one of those in that camp. I'm thinking that our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=10910)|
| 3:01:54| motion probably should be to instruct the law director to draw up a lease| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=10914)|
| 3:01:58| or draw up an agreement with Hillcrest which would call for a contract| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=10918)|
| 3:02:02| extension, elimination of the clause without termination, allowing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=10922)|
| 3:02:06| Hillcrest to sublease, etc., rather than us going on ahead and approving it now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=10926)|
| 3:02:10| because the devil's in the details. I think that the law director would agree| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=10930)|
| 3:02:14| that we're voting on a document that we haven't seen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=10934)|
| 3:02:18| We have the intent and what we want to do and what we want to accomplish,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=10938)|
| 3:02:22| but I think that rather than us voting and saying this is how we're going to do it, we might want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=10942)|
| 3:02:26| to see the document and have the negotiation with Hillcrest and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=10946)|
| 3:02:30| the county and let us vote on the document next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=10950)|
| 3:02:34| That puts them 30 days further in the hole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=10954)|
| 3:02:38| Well, maybe we need to have a special call meeting, but we were all critical of Congress for voting on an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=10958)|
| 3:02:42| 1,100-page document nobody had read, and so I think the intent here is to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=10962)|
| 3:02:46| work with Hillcrest, but again, we've got a document we haven't seen. We haven't seen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=10966)|
| 3:02:50| details of how these things would be worked out, Mr. Law Director. Am I off base here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=10970)|
| 3:02:54| Well, to approve, this is a contract| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=10974)|
| 3:02:58| that you're going to have to approve, and you can't approve it without| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=10978)|
| 3:03:02| the contract. Right, so we have no contract. I mean, we know what we want to do. It's just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=10982)|
| 3:03:06| that we do not have a document in front of us to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=10986)|
| 3:03:10| We have an existing document, and what we're really saying at the table today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=10990)|
| 3:03:14| is amend that existing document to say... Same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=10994)|
| 3:03:18| The terms you're talking about are going to... Can we vote on the terms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=10998)|
| 3:03:22| that we want in the document? That's what we're voting on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=11002)|
| 3:03:26| That's what we're doing now. That's what I'm saying. And I think if we extend this another month, it'll be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=11006)|
| 3:03:30| just like the guidance we gave to the law director last month. It was so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=11010)|
| 3:03:34| vague just to have a discussion on the certificate of need. I think we need to give him| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=11014)|
| 3:03:38| some hard things like these bullets, give him hard dates and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=11018)|
| 3:03:42| conditions, and then he brings the contract back. But just to go back and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=11022)|
| 3:03:46| go back and discuss it and bring it back in 30 days, I don't think it buys Hillcrest anything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=11026)|
| 3:03:50| and it doesn't... No, my suggestion is we tell him what we want. We know what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=11030)|
| 3:03:54| we want. It's just a matter of he's got to draw up the document, and then we're going to have to vote on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=11034)|
| 3:03:58| document at some point. Right. I would strongly suggest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=11038)|
| 3:04:02| that you not simply vote| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=11042)|
| 3:04:06| today and then we create a document| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=11046)|
| 3:04:10| and it be signed and we go forward. It may require| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=11050)|
| 3:04:14| a special call meeting just for the purpose of approving the new| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=11054)|
| 3:04:18| contract. But if that's what it requires, that's what we should do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=11058)|
| 3:04:22| I'll commit to getting that done very quickly and have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=11062)|
| 3:04:26| a document that I'll present, you know, whatever| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=11066)|
| 3:04:30| it is that's the pleasure of the commission, if you vote that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=11070)|
| 3:04:34| Could you have it ready for the agenda meeting? We could use that for a special call meeting, the agenda| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=11074)|
| 3:04:38| meeting. No, because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=11078)|
| 3:04:42| a bunch of us won't be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=11082)|
| 3:04:46| We'll just have one sometime.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=11086)|
| 3:04:50| Commissioner and Mr. Lockett, under tab 3 in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=11090)|
| 3:04:54| packet that we distributed, there is a draft proposed lease| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=11094)|
| 3:04:58| amendment that you could use to expedite your review, if you would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=11098)|
| 3:05:02| Ms. Porter, just one quick question. You understand what I'm saying. We want to help| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=11102)|
| 3:05:06| you, we want to do this, but we've got to have a document. Can you wait a couple| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=11106)|
| 3:05:10| of weeks and give him time to draw it up, and then if we have a special call meeting within the next two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=11110)|
| 3:05:14| weeks, can you live with that? If the terms, if I can walk out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=11114)|
| 3:05:18| today with the basic terms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=11118)|
| 3:05:22| that indicate stability so that I can go ahead and have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=11122)|
| 3:05:26| these discussions and my board can go ahead and review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=11126)|
| 3:05:30| the proposal of a potential partner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=11130)|
| 3:05:34| yes, sir, I think we can. And I think that's our intent, is to instruct the law director on what we want in that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=11134)|
| 3:05:38| document, but we don't have a document to look at. Certainly. Bill, can we vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=11138)|
| 3:05:42| We can vote on the terms right now, can't we? Yes, sir, you can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=11142)|
| 3:05:46| Let me make one point, though, because I don't want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=11146)|
| 3:05:50| you, ma'am, to be misled about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=11150)|
| 3:05:54| what we can legally and legally cannot do or commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=11154)|
| 3:05:58| And again, deferring to Mr. Holt,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=11158)|
| 3:06:02| we're limited in what we can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=11162)|
| 3:06:06| contract to do in terms of the sale of real estate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=11166)|
| 3:06:10| And we cannot simply| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=11170)|
| 3:06:14| enter into a lease purchase where you are guaranteed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=11174)|
| 3:06:18| that right. We can draft| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=11178)|
| 3:06:22| a provision that says that we can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=11182)|
| 3:06:26| negotiate with you, but it's subject to the market| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=11186)|
| 3:06:30| analysis that Mr. Holt described.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=11190)|
| 3:06:34| And then if that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=11194)|
| 3:06:38| market analysis shows that you're the only interested buyer, we can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=11198)|
| 3:06:42| negotiate. If it does not show that, then a negotiated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=11202)|
| 3:06:46| sale is not allowed, and the only way that the property could then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=11206)|
| 3:06:50| be sold would be through sealed bid or auction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=11210)|
| 3:06:54| One question and one comment, if I may. The question is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=11214)|
| 3:06:58| is a first right of refusal clause acceptable?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=11218)|
| 3:07:02| No, ma'am. Well, it is if the market| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=11222)|
| 3:07:06| analysis comes back showing that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=11226)|
| 3:07:10| you're the only interested buyer, but it would be subject to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=11230)|
| 3:07:14| And my comment would be to make sure that the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=11234)|
| 3:07:18| proposal is either strictly for real estate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=11238)|
| 3:07:22| or if it is for a joint purchase of real estate and business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=11242)|
| 3:07:26| because I believe there has been significant confusion about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=11246)|
| 3:07:30| Well, the only thing that we can sell| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=11250)|
| 3:07:34| is the real estate. I understand. And that's why I make the point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=11254)|
| 3:07:38| because all of the folks that I've talked to across the nation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=11258)|
| 3:07:42| when they value a nursing home, it is a price per bed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=11262)|
| 3:07:46| inclusive of the operation and the real estate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=11266)|
| 3:07:50| Ms. Poynter, if we do this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=11270)|
| 3:07:54| now and you're bidding on it and you don't bid the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=11274)|
| 3:07:58| fair market value, would you be willing to turn this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=11278)|
| 3:08:02| certificate of need over to whoever purchased it? We don't want to put these patients| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=11282)|
| 3:08:06| and these workers through this again. Mr. Pinkston, we have said that we will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=11286)|
| 3:08:10| jointly go down a path cooperatively with the county to sell| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=11290)|
| 3:08:14| the business with the real estate if that was the chosen path.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=11294)|
| 3:08:18| But I'm asking you, are you talking about you're going to go down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=11298)|
| 3:08:22| it jointly about turning in the con to someone else if they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=11302)|
| 3:08:26| bid on it? That's part of the sale of the business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=11306)|
| 3:08:30| Point of order. I thought Commissioner Anders| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=11310)|
| 3:08:34| still had the floor. Commissioner Armstrong, you're finished, aren't you, Brad?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=11314)|
| 3:08:38| Well, I just want to see if he accepts the amendment of 2016 and 15 percent above $100,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=11318)|
| 3:08:42| We'll accept that. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=11322)|
| 3:08:46| Question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=11326)|
| 3:08:50| You're finished, Brad. Brad, you finished?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=11330)|
| 3:08:54| Yes, sir. I'm sorry. Thank you. Commissioner McKinley. Well, no, because that was my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=11334)|
| 3:08:58| Commissioner Burroughs. I have two things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=11338)|
| 3:09:02| One is that we've got this friendly amendment now. Is that something that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=11342)|
| 3:09:06| Ms. Pointer has agreed to? Are you okay with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=11346)|
| 3:09:10| the 15 and the 16 year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=11350)|
| 3:09:14| 2016 and 15 percent. I'm hearing a lot of people say that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=11354)|
| 3:09:18| their number one concern are the residents that live at Hillcrest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=11358)|
| 3:09:22| But that's all I hear them say. And then they start talking about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=11362)|
| 3:09:26| percentages and money and sales. And if we're going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=11366)|
| 3:09:30| really put these senior citizens, these residents of Hillcrest first,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=11370)|
| 3:09:34| then let's pass this and then come back later| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=11374)|
| 3:09:38| and make any adjustments to it that we need to. There's nothing preventing us from doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=11378)|
| 3:09:42| But I think these people have been here, I don't know how many meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=11382)|
| 3:09:46| now. They've sat here all day. I haven't received anything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=11386)|
| 3:09:50| but comments to support Hillcrest from constituents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=11390)|
| 3:09:54| all over the county. I think it's time to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=11394)|
| 3:09:58| vote on this and move on so that these people stop worrying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=11398)|
| 3:10:02| about whether they're going to have to move to Memphis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=11402)|
| 3:10:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=11406)|
| 3:10:10| Did you want to answer that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=11410)|
| 3:10:14| I guess I'd just like to hear the parameters one more time before I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=11414)|
| 3:10:18| asked do we agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=11418)|
| 3:10:22| Tom Stone, you want to go ahead with Joe?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=11422)|
| 3:10:26| We'll extend until June 2016.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=11426)|
| 3:10:30| We'll have a for cause clause| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=11430)|
| 3:10:34| for termination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=11434)|
| 3:10:38| We will have a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=11438)|
| 3:10:42| negotiated purchase in accordance, well, our law director| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=11442)|
| 3:10:46| just left, but in accordance with the legal parameters| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=11446)|
| 3:10:50| required upon us in this type| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=11450)|
| 3:10:54| of a negotiated sale. And we will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=11454)|
| 3:10:58| allow subleasing, and I have compromised that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=11458)|
| 3:11:02| to 15% over any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=11462)|
| 3:11:06| revenue of $100,000 per month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=11466)|
| 3:11:10| 15% of that amount will go to Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=11470)|
| 3:11:14| That's the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=11474)|
| 3:11:18| Mr. Armstrong, you're saying anything above $100,000 per month?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=11478)|
| 3:11:22| I don't know. That's a lot of money per month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=11482)|
| 3:11:26| I don't know if you could lease a building for $100,000 per month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=11486)|
| 3:11:30| That was what my concern was, and I've talked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=11490)|
| 3:11:34| to a couple of people about it. What my concern was is that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=11494)|
| 3:11:38| we not start taking money off the top, and we had discussed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=11498)|
| 3:11:42| the $100,000 earlier, that we not start taking a percentage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=11502)|
| 3:11:46| off the top until after they get to the point where they're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=11506)|
| 3:11:50| solvent, and they're going in the hole about $100,000 a month now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=11510)|
| 3:11:54| So I said we should not start taking money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=11514)|
| 3:11:58| a percentage until after they've reached the point where they're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=11518)|
| 3:12:02| going to have an infusion of money from this partnership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=11522)|
| 3:12:06| And you can't have a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=11526)|
| 3:12:10| Who has the floor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=11530)|
| 3:12:14| Ms. Poynter, are you okay with that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=11534)|
| 3:12:18| Yes, sir. I've just consulted with my board, and yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=11538)|
| 3:12:22| Okay. Now, are there any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=11542)|
| 3:12:26| I'm finished. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=11546)|
| 3:12:30| Commissioner Hammond?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=11550)|
| 3:12:34| I was the seconder of the motion. I wasn't going to agree with it until I heard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=11554)|
| 3:12:38| everything, and I heard Ms. Poynter. Now that I've heard that, I'll agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=11558)|
| 3:12:42| Thank you, Chairman, and Mr. Luthold, I'll be brief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=11562)|
| 3:12:46| I'm in general agreement with everything that's been discussed and debated here for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=11566)|
| 3:12:50| a couple of hours. But, you know, we've had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=11570)|
| 3:12:54| two or three people, I don't know how credible they were, throwing around big dollars,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=11574)|
| 3:12:58| $22 million, and huge sums. Again, we don't know if they were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=11578)|
| 3:13:02| deep pockets or headlines or credit or whatnot. I just want assurance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=11582)|
| 3:13:06| that we're not freezing ourselves out by going out seven years on this lease.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=11586)|
| 3:13:10| We still have that option to sell if some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=11590)|
| 3:13:14| other entity walks in with a deal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=11594)|
| 3:13:18| that we like and the three people, I think Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=11598)|
| 3:13:22| Hope referred to three entities, didn't he? Do you feel confident we still have that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=11602)|
| 3:13:26| option in front of us? No, I don't. That's the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=11606)|
| 3:13:30| whole reason for the request for the lease extension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=11610)|
| 3:13:34| As I understand it, the only way that they can interest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=11614)|
| 3:13:38| a business partner is to have the stability of that lease extension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=11618)|
| 3:13:42| If someone can come in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=11622)|
| 3:13:46| six months or seven months from now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=11626)|
| 3:13:50| then they won't be able to interest that other business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=11630)|
| 3:13:54| partner. So if this lease extension is agreed to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=11634)|
| 3:13:58| we're tied in until that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=11638)|
| 3:14:02| lease term expires.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=11642)|
| 3:14:06| Did it make any sense to have Mr. Hope bring| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=11646)|
| 3:14:10| secure letters of intent? That was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=11650)|
| 3:14:14| dealing with this lease term about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=11654)|
| 3:14:18| wanting to be able to purchase the property, and I was trying to make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=11658)|
| 3:14:22| clear that under our purchasing code, the one option of a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=11662)|
| 3:14:26| negotiated sale is contingent on a market analysis. So really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=11666)|
| 3:14:30| the only option to sell or to liquidate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=11670)|
| 3:14:34| I hate to use that word, but to monetize this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=11674)|
| 3:14:38| entity is through Ms. Poynter's group and or partners she| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=11678)|
| 3:14:42| may bring in. No, it's not the only way. I was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=11682)|
| 3:14:46| trying to let them know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=11686)|
| 3:14:50| that whatever form this agreement takes, it's not a guarantee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=11690)|
| 3:14:54| to Ms. Poynter, to Hillcrest,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=11694)|
| 3:14:58| that at a given point in time, they'll simply be able to exercise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=11698)|
| 3:15:02| an option to purchase. They will not be able to do that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=11702)|
| 3:15:06| unless a market analysis demonstrates that Hillcrest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=11706)|
| 3:15:10| is the only interested buyer. Okay. And if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=11710)|
| 3:15:14| a market analysis does not demonstrate that, then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=11714)|
| 3:15:18| a negotiated sale is off the table and it will be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=11718)|
| 3:15:22| sold by sealed bid or public auction. Okay, so there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=11722)|
| 3:15:26| is still a market analysis is still out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=11726)|
| 3:15:30| undetermined at this point. Correct. And won't even be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=11730)|
| 3:15:34| up for discussion until the end of the lease term,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=11734)|
| 3:15:38| seven years out. Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=11738)|
| 3:15:42| Okay, we have a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=11742)|
| 3:15:46| regular motion. Is everyone clear?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=11746)|
| 3:15:50| Mr. Chairman, I want to make sure we will have a special call meeting to approve the contract, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=11750)|
| 3:15:54| We're giving him the specifics, but we will have to have a special call meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=11754)|
| 3:15:58| When he's finished,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=11758)|
| 3:16:02| five days after that, very close to it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=11762)|
| 3:16:06| I'll call a call meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=11766)|
| 3:16:10| Everyone okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=11770)|
| 3:16:14| No question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=11774)|
| 3:16:18| The purpose of the special call meeting is simply to sign the contract, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=11778)|
| 3:16:22| It's not to re-debate any of these points again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=11782)|
| 3:16:26| Correct. Okay, so there will be no re-debate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=11786)|
| 3:16:30| of any of these points at that meeting, correct? I don't think we can say that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=11790)|
| 3:16:34| I don't think you can say it either, but that's the problem with what we're doing here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=11794)|
| 3:16:38| Mr. Law Director,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=11798)|
| 3:16:42| what if they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=11802)|
| 3:16:46| partner up with for a profit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=11806)|
| 3:16:50| I understood from the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=11810)|
| 3:16:54| question earlier that the answer was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=11814)|
| 3:16:58| that they had a not-for-profit arm, and that's how they were going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=11818)|
| 3:17:02| to partner. With a not-for-profit? Apparently. Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=11822)|
| 3:17:06| Ms. Poynter is affirming that. Okay, but if they do go with, if they come in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=11826)|
| 3:17:10| with a for-profit, we need to renegotiate this lease. That needs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=11830)|
| 3:17:14| to be put in there. Well, why don't we put in there the partnership,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=11834)|
| 3:17:18| if any, will be with a not-for-profit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=11838)|
| 3:17:22| I'm fine with that, and I would assume then the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=11842)|
| 3:17:26| market study that was done would be based on not-for-profit potential buyers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=11846)|
| 3:17:30| I'll defer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=11850)|
| 3:17:34| Now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=11854)|
| 3:17:38| I don't, you know, I'll defer to commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=11858)|
| 3:17:42| That's not my decision, but the only thing that the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=11862)|
| 3:17:46| would be selling is the real estate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=11866)|
| 3:17:50| Now, so you're talking about a different thing, though. Yes, I am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=11870)|
| 3:17:54| Because you're talking about Hillcrest, the business entity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=11874)|
| 3:17:58| merging with another business entity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=11878)|
| 3:18:02| So I don't think it appropriate that the county be limited| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=11882)|
| 3:18:06| to selling this property to a not-for-profit entity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=11886)|
| 3:18:10| because we're only selling the property. But that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=11890)|
| 3:18:14| entity would then need to buy the existing business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=11894)|
| 3:18:18| to be able to continue to operate as a nursing home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=11898)|
| 3:18:22| It would, but that decision is at least seven years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=11902)|
| 3:18:26| down the road. And I don't think that the commission or the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=11906)|
| 3:18:30| should be tied down to doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=11910)|
| 3:18:34| Then I'm not sure Hillcrest needs to be tied down to doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=11914)|
| 3:18:38| Well, that's Hillcrest's decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=11918)|
| 3:18:42| It is certainly our intent to do that and find someone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=11922)|
| 3:18:46| akin to the mission that we have. We have no intent of changing the mission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=11926)|
| 3:18:50| of Hillcrest. And the potential partner with whom we're scheduled to meet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=11930)|
| 3:18:54| this week, contingent upon today's decision, has a not-for-profit arm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=11934)|
| 3:18:58| They are our preference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=11938)|
| 3:19:02| Are you finished, Commissioner Burroughs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=11942)|
| 3:19:06| I would like to say that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=11946)|
| 3:19:10| if we are going to re-debate this all over again| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=11950)|
| 3:19:14| at the special called meeting, then what we do today is pretty pointless| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=11954)|
| 3:19:18| as far as making these people feel like they have something other than| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=11958)|
| 3:19:22| jello under their feet. And I also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=11962)|
| 3:19:26| want to call for the question. So I guess I'm asking for everyone to please be honorable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=11966)|
| 3:19:30| in the special called meeting coming up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=11970)|
| 3:19:34| that we only sign a contract based on what we agree| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=11974)|
| 3:19:38| right here to do right now when we vote on this, which I hope we're doing right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=11978)|
| 3:19:42| Commissioner Lutho. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Just a real quick question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=11982)|
| 3:19:46| If they were to merge with a for-profit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=11986)|
| 3:19:50| not that they will, they're saying that they won't, but, Mr. Law Director,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=11990)|
| 3:19:54| what would be the consequences, possible property tax consequences, if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=11994)|
| 3:19:58| they merged with a for-profit, if any?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=11998)|
| 3:20:02| Would they be subject to possibly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=12002)|
| 3:20:06| personal property taxes on their business? Possibly. But, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=12006)|
| 3:20:10| I'm not a mergers and acquisitions lawyer, but it depends on who's the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=12010)|
| 3:20:14| dominant partner. You know, you can go into business with a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=12014)|
| 3:20:18| for-profit, but still remain a not-for-profit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=12018)|
| 3:20:22| But, I think, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=12022)|
| 3:20:26| there could be tax consequences if they did, possibly. Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=12026)|
| 3:20:30| They could automatically convert from a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=12030)|
| 3:20:34| exempt business entity under the tax code to one that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=12034)|
| 3:20:38| pays taxes. That might behoove them to stay with a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=12038)|
| 3:20:42| not-for-profit organization, possibly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=12042)|
| 3:20:46| Commissioner McKenzie. Sorry to belabor the point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=12046)|
| 3:20:50| but I'm trying to get an understanding of everything we're voting on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=12050)|
| 3:20:54| I thought I was clear, and then we start throwing for-profits and not-for-profits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=12054)|
| 3:20:58| in there. And I'm glad we did,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=12058)|
| 3:21:02| because I don't think that we need to give| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=12062)|
| 3:21:06| this contract or give this next seven years, you know, the potential to go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=12066)|
| 3:21:10| into a business with a for-profit. I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=12070)|
| 3:21:14| since 1960, you know, they've been a dollar a year, and I think that has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=12074)|
| 3:21:18| merit and validity. And then to allow this contract| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=12078)|
| 3:21:22| to go on to a for-profit, while I agree with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=12082)|
| 3:21:26| everything, all the great accolades of Hillcrest, I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=12086)|
| 3:21:30| think that would be pretty responsible on our part at this point to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=12090)|
| 3:21:34| that. So are we saying that this contract,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=12094)|
| 3:21:38| whatever, whoever they negotiate with, that the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=12098)|
| 3:21:42| final conglomeration is a non-profit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=12102)|
| 3:21:46| period? That, to me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=12106)|
| 3:21:50| is really going to swing how I vote for that. And is that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=12110)|
| 3:21:54| legal, I guess, Law Director? Yes, sir. And we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=12114)|
| 3:21:58| need to keep in mind here that this contract, we keep talking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=12118)|
| 3:22:02| about this contract as if it were an extremely| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=12122)|
| 3:22:06| sophisticated merger and acquisition document. It's a lease.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=12126)|
| 3:22:10| That's all we're amending. So in light| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=12130)|
| 3:22:14| of the terms that we've discussed here today, I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=12134)|
| 3:22:18| it's the pleasure of the commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=12138)|
| 3:22:22| and I need to know that to go forward, that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=12142)|
| 3:22:26| the lease have a provision in it that says if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=12146)|
| 3:22:30| there is an acquisition or if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=12150)|
| 3:22:34| Hillcrest takes on a business partner, that the entity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=12154)|
| 3:22:38| that's operating the nursing home facility must remain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=12158)|
| 3:22:42| not-for-profit or that lease is going to terminate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=12162)|
| 3:22:46| So, Commissioner Armstrong, could I add that as a friendly amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=12166)|
| 3:22:50| for the county taxpayer's sake? We're going to substitute this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=12170)|
| 3:22:54| thing to death. The main reason this whole thing started| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=12174)|
| 3:22:58| is I just want to make sure we take care of these people. It's just that simple.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=12178)|
| 3:23:02| So,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=12182)|
| 3:23:06| how bad will that be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=12186)|
| 3:23:10| I don't think it will be a problem. If| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=12190)|
| 3:23:14| this first partner falls out and I have to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=12194)|
| 3:23:18| look another one, it may be a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=12198)|
| 3:23:22| I'll accept your amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=12202)|
| 3:23:26| But I hope, I mean, we have a call for the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=12206)|
| 3:23:30| We've had two calls for the question. We've had 15. We didn't get a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=12210)|
| 3:23:34| I'm with it. Now we've got a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=12214)|
| 3:23:38| second for the call. I never heard a second. Well, I guess I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=12218)|
| 3:23:42| need to ask the seconder. He accepted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=12222)|
| 3:23:46| my amendment. I have to make sure that Commissioner Hammond is okay. Yes, Mr. Armstrong is okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=12226)|
| 3:23:50| I'm okay. And I'm ready to vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=12230)|
| 3:23:54| We have a call for the question in a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=12234)|
| 3:23:58| All for the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=12238)|
| 3:24:02| I just want to reemphasize| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=12242)|
| 3:24:06| what a lot of the fellow commissioners have stated up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=12246)|
| 3:24:10| Being born and raised in the 7th District, I have grown up with Hillcrest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=12250)|
| 3:24:14| I've had relatives that have been in Hillcrest, and I have family members who| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=12254)|
| 3:24:18| are in the health care. I know how much these area hospitals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=12258)|
| 3:24:22| depend on Hillcrest to be there. The Kidney Dialysis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=12262)|
| 3:24:26| Company I think would be absolutely awesome| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=12266)|
| 3:24:30| for Hillcrest to be able to lease that out, because I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=12270)|
| 3:24:34| understand from the hospitals and the medical staff that it is very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=12274)|
| 3:24:38| difficult to find nursing homes that will take kidney| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=12278)|
| 3:24:42| dialysis patients, because there is so much expense involved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=12282)|
| 3:24:46| and so much time, and it's so hard on the patients transporting them back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=12286)|
| 3:24:50| and forth. So I just want the community to know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=12290)|
| 3:24:54| that I stand behind Hillcrest, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=12294)|
| 3:24:58| how we're voting today, I support you, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=12298)|
| 3:25:02| as Ms. Brolls said, if we come back for this contract and there's more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=12302)|
| 3:25:06| negotiation, I will still support Hillcrest, and I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=12306)|
| 3:25:10| here to make sure that our elderly are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=12310)|
| 3:25:14| taken care of in Knox County, because it is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=12314)|
| 3:25:18| our duty to make sure they're taken care of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=12318)|
| 3:25:22| And thank you, Ms. Poynter and all your staff, because you have absolutely| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=12322)|
| 3:25:26| handled this situation in a very class act, and I just want to applaud| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=12326)|
| 3:25:30| all of you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=12330)|
| 3:25:38| Do we have to vote on the call? We're ready.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=12338)|
| 3:25:42| So you all can take your motion back and your second. Is that okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=12342)|
| 3:25:46| We're ready to vote. All in favor say aye. Aye. Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=12346)|
| 3:25:50| It's unanimous. The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=12350)|
| 3:25:54| Thank the Lord. Take a break, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=12354)|

| 3:26:02| Break. Take a five-minute break.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=12362)|
| 3:26:06| What do we have next?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=12366)|
| 3:26:14| 903.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=12374)|
| 3:26:18| 903 is a resolution to take further action in regard to the vacant, deteriorated, or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=12378)|
| 3:26:22| blighted property ordinance for property located at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=12382)|

| 3:26:42| Grant?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=12402)|
| 3:26:46| This is Grant Rosenberg, Knox County Office of Neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=12406)|
| 3:26:50| The property you have before you is a property that's been before the vacant property review commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=12410)|
| 3:26:54| We referred it to the vacant property review commission in September.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=12414)|
| 3:26:58| It was referred. They were given 90 days. It was referred to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=12418)|
| 3:27:02| the vacant property review commission last month. In front of you is the demolition estimate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=12422)|
| 3:27:06| We just received that this morning. I apologize for getting that to you late.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=12426)|
| 3:27:10| We just received it this morning from purchasing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=12430)|
| 3:27:14| The demolition estimate is right around| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=12434)|
| 3:27:18| 11-5. The property was appraised| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=12438)|
| 3:27:22| at 13-5. Taxes owed are around $2,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=12442)|
| 3:27:26| We're looking at a break even if we were to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=12446)|
| 3:27:30| take ownership of the property. It's before you to take| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=12450)|
| 3:27:34| further action similar to last month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=12454)|
| 3:27:38| Either us pursuing eminent domain in the blighted property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=12458)|
| 3:27:42| ordinance or us authorizing our office to pursue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=12462)|
| 3:27:46| the dirty lot ordinance and demolish the structure and file a lien on the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=12466)|
| 3:27:50| What's your preference?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=12470)|
| 3:27:54| What's your preference, Grant?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=12474)|
| 3:27:58| I really don't have a preference either way. My preference is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=12478)|
| 3:28:02| bringing the property into compliance with Knox County Code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=12482)|
| 3:28:06| Either means achieves that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=12486)|
| 3:28:10| Correct me if I'm wrong, Grant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=12490)|
| 3:28:14| The decision that you're making is whether to exercise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=12494)|
| 3:28:18| your power of eminent domain or not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=12498)|
| 3:28:22| under the vacant and blighted property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=12502)|
| 3:28:26| ordinance. If you do not choose to go that route,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=12506)|
| 3:28:30| then this department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=12510)|
| 3:28:34| will proceed under the dirty lot ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=12514)|
| 3:28:42| Were you able to contact this property owner, Grant?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=12522)|
| 3:28:46| We have been unsuccessful in contacting the property owner. From our understanding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=12526)|
| 3:28:50| and this is the understanding from my code enforcement officer, was that the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=12530)|
| 3:28:54| property had sustained a fire and the property owner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=12534)|
| 3:28:58| left town, didn't have insurance money to cover the cost of damage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=12538)|
| 3:29:02| And again, how much are the back taxes on this one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=12542)|
| 3:29:06| I think they're somewhere around $2,000. I believe it's in the packet. I put the tax bill in the packet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=12546)|
| 3:29:18| Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=12558)|
| 3:29:22| Somebody else has a lien on it also. Is there a bank involved? Was it financed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=12562)|
| 3:29:26| And that also left hanging?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=12566)|
| 3:29:30| Not that I'm aware of. We haven't been able to do that kind of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=12570)|
| 3:29:34| I don't think we've done a title search. The appraisal, I think, included some of that title search.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=12574)|
| 3:29:42| Mr. Lutho, working in the trustee's office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=12582)|
| 3:29:46| do we have some way that we sell this property at a delinquent tax sale| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=12586)|
| 3:29:50| now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=12590)|
| 3:29:54| What I don't know, first of all, property has to be at least three years in arrears, okay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=12594)|
| 3:29:58| for it to be even eligible for a tax sale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=12598)|
| 3:30:02| Then, even if it were, if the trustee's office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=12602)|
| 3:30:06| decided to place a property in a tax sale,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=12606)|
| 3:30:10| we'll spend another $1,100, $1,200 in costs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=12610)|
| 3:30:14| to place it in a tax sale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=12614)|
| 3:30:18| And then you further hinder your ability to sell it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=12618)|
| 3:30:22| especially if you've got this structure on there that needs to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=12622)|
| 3:30:26| demolished, but you don't get a warranty deed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=12626)|
| 3:30:30| when you buy property through a tax sale. You get what's called a clerk and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=12630)|
| 3:30:34| master's deed. And when you have a clerk and master's deed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=12634)|
| 3:30:38| you can't obtain title insurance, which means| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=12638)|
| 3:30:42| you can't go out and get a loan against that property. Therefore, it hinders| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=12642)|
| 3:30:46| your, the value, or makes the value of the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=12646)|
| 3:30:50| less than if we possibly take it over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=12650)|
| 3:30:54| And that was what I was getting ready to ask, was if we take| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=12654)|
| 3:30:58| a property by eminent domain, can we then, Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=12658)|
| 3:31:02| Law Director, sell it with, what kind of deed would we be giving| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=12662)|
| 3:31:06| to the person, the buyer of this property? Would it be a warranty| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=12666)|
| 3:31:10| deed, or what type of deed would it be? We give quit claim deeds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=12670)|
| 3:31:14| We would be giving a quit claim deed, which may be better than a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=12674)|
| 3:31:18| clerk and master's deed, right? A quit claim deed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=12678)|
| 3:31:22| is saying, you know, we're giving it to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=12682)|
| 3:31:26| It's up to you to do your due diligence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=12686)|
| 3:31:30| to see if there are any liens or other encumbrances on the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=12690)|
| 3:31:34| But if we've gone through the eminent domain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=12694)|
| 3:31:38| process, that pretty well cuts the legs out from everybody, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=12698)|
| 3:31:42| Well, whether it does or not, we still only give a quit claim deed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=12702)|
| 3:31:46| So we make no representations as to the title of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=12706)|
| 3:31:50| It may be worth more this way than through a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=12710)|
| 3:31:54| tax sale on the market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=12714)|
| 3:31:58| Commissioner Wright. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=12718)|
| 3:32:02| I'm in favor of the lot being cleaned up, no matter which direction we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=12722)|
| 3:32:06| go. The problem I was going to have was in eminent domain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=12726)|
| 3:32:10| Can someone give me the pluses and minuses of using| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=12730)|
| 3:32:14| eminent domain? What would, Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=12734)|
| 3:32:18| Law Director, you can start out and say. Well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=12738)|
| 3:32:22| legally, I mean, there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=12742)|
| 3:32:26| no question that we have the power of eminent domain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=12746)|
| 3:32:30| It's really a policy decision whether or not you want to exercise it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=12750)|
| 3:32:34| or not. I've expressed this before. The one issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=12754)|
| 3:32:38| that I always want us to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=12758)|
| 3:32:42| consider, at least, and on some of these residential properties, it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=12762)|
| 3:32:46| might not be as much of a concern. But if we take title| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=12766)|
| 3:32:50| to property, then we need to be very careful| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=12770)|
| 3:32:54| about what is on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=12774)|
| 3:32:58| Because we don't want to acquire an environmental problem| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=12778)|
| 3:33:02| that would make it impossible for us to then dispose of the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=12782)|
| 3:33:06| without investing a huge amount of money in it. That's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=12786)|
| 3:33:10| one caveat to exercising eminent domain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=12790)|
| 3:33:14| But besides that, I mean, there's no question that we have the legal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=12794)|
| 3:33:18| authority to proceed that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=12798)|
| 3:33:26| Are there any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=12806)|
| 3:33:30| Grant, did he give you what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=12810)|
| 3:33:34| this lot may be worth if the dwelling wasn't on it, if it was off of there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=12814)|
| 3:33:38| It's in your appraisal there. I'm looking through here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=12818)|
| 3:33:42| Did you not say it was worth $13,000? Well, it's $13,500.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=12822)|
| 3:33:46| That's with the dwelling on it. Now, they have here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=12826)|
| 3:33:50| the adjustment. Probably worth more without it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=12830)|
| 3:33:54| They have it at a $10,000 removal fee. So, yeah, that's...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=12834)|
| 3:33:58| If you add $10,000 to the $13,500, if the structure was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=12838)|
| 3:34:02| not on the property. You're saying it would be worth about $23,000 if the structure was off?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=12842)|
| 3:34:06| Correct. That's what it looks like, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=12846)|
| 3:34:14| Someone ready to make a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=12854)|
| 3:34:22| Well, we can move on to the next one then. Grant, what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=12862)|
| 3:34:26| I apologize, but what was it you exactly, you wanted us to take action, you wanted the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=12866)|
| 3:34:30| put into condition, right? One way or the other, it's been through the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=12870)|
| 3:34:34| blighted property procedure. For what the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=12874)|
| 3:34:38| blighted property ordinance says, it's been through that whole process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=12878)|
| 3:34:42| It is here before you to take further action. If you take| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=12882)|
| 3:34:46| further action on the blighted property ordinance, generally that is pursuing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=12886)|
| 3:34:50| eminent domain. Is that what district? That's the ninth district?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=12890)|
| 3:34:54| This is in the sixth district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=12894)|
| 3:34:58| What's the will of the sixth district?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=12898)|
| 3:35:02| We'll make a motion. Commissioner Lambert? I'll make the motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=12902)|
| 3:35:06| that, I mean, it's a piece of property. It's a house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=12906)|
| 3:35:10| I make the motion that we tear it down, clean the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=12910)|
| 3:35:14| up, and I don't think it's necessary to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=12914)|
| 3:35:18| use eminent domain for a small piece of property like that, but I do think it's necessary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=12918)|
| 3:35:22| to clean the property up and then put a lien on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=12922)|
| 3:35:26| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=12926)|
| 3:35:30| Do you have anything to add to that, Mr. Law Director?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=12930)|
| 3:35:34| Pardon? Is that a? That's an option. There's no question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=12934)|
| 3:35:38| that's an option. I mean, it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=12938)|
| 3:35:42| in this instance, correct me if I'm wrong, Grant, didn't you say we hadn't been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=12942)|
| 3:35:46| able to locate the property owner, so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=12946)|
| 3:35:50| we tear it down and put a lien against it. That's where it's going to sit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=12950)|
| 3:35:54| Because we can't find the owner to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=12954)|
| 3:35:58| get them to pay for it to remove the lien. So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=12958)|
| 3:36:02| we're going to expend the money to tear it down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=12962)|
| 3:36:06| put a lien on it, and it'll probably be in that condition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=12966)|
| 3:36:10| long after all of us are gone. Well, I guess, Grant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=12970)|
| 3:36:14| Mr. Law Director, if we tear this down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=12974)|
| 3:36:18| and these deeds and this lien isn't paid off, we can put it in a tax sale| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=12978)|
| 3:36:22| possibly then and may recoup something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=12982)|
| 3:36:26| I realize what Mr. Lutho said, but we could probably recoup some of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=12986)|
| 3:36:30| That's what I'm getting at, is that we'd also have, we'd be able to recoup| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=12990)|
| 3:36:34| some of it, but we would still have the additional cost that we don't have today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=12994)|
| 3:36:38| of tearing it down. But that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=12998)|
| 3:36:42| a policy decision. Legally we can proceed either way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=13002)|
| 3:36:46| Grant, let me, I mean, here's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=13006)|
| 3:36:50| the way I'm looking at it, and you've got a lot more experience with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=13010)|
| 3:36:54| this stuff than I do. And what I'm looking at is that if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=13014)|
| 3:36:58| we've got a property owner that's just disappeared,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=13018)|
| 3:37:02| when they don't pay their taxes, we'll wind up taking it through a tax| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=13022)|
| 3:37:06| sale anyway, and then we'll have this amount that's owed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=13026)|
| 3:37:10| the county that will be thrown on top of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=13030)|
| 3:37:14| I mean, do you see that this property has enough value to where it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=13034)|
| 3:37:18| would behoove us to take it through eminent domain and do some sort| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=13038)|
| 3:37:22| of a sale right now? I can't really speak to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=13042)|
| 3:37:26| the market and how much this property is worth to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=13046)|
| 3:37:30| Again, my main concern is eliminating the blight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=13050)|
| 3:37:34| and bringing the property into compliance. Surely,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=13054)|
| 3:37:38| as Mr. Lockett said, if we pursue eminent domain, we could certainly recoup| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=13058)|
| 3:37:42| our costs much more quickly, and we could acquire the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=13062)|
| 3:37:46| property more quickly than if we were to wait and let it go into a tax| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=13066)|
| 3:37:50| sale. Either way, we're going to end up demolishing the structure, so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=13070)|
| 3:37:54| we'll bring it into compliance one way or the other. It's just recouping| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=13074)|
| 3:37:58| those expenses. What kind of cost| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=13078)|
| 3:38:02| is it going to cost us to tear it down? We can do it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=13082)|
| 3:38:06| in-house with our crew at around $11,500, a little over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=13086)|
| 3:38:10| $11,000. So, I mean, here's my hesitancy to use eminent domain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=13090)|
| 3:38:14| We can't find the owner, so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=13094)|
| 3:38:18| who are we going to pay for it? And when we put it up for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=13098)|
| 3:38:22| sale, the person's obviously not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=13102)|
| 3:38:26| here, or the person who owns this property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=13106)|
| 3:38:30| may not even realize they own it. They may have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=13110)|
| 3:38:34| inherited it from someone who previously owned it, and they don't realize| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=13114)|
| 3:38:38| that this was part of that estate. And the reason why I'm saying if we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=13118)|
| 3:38:42| jump the gun and go ahead and sell this property today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=13122)|
| 3:38:46| you know, we're in a tough real estate market, so the property's going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=13126)|
| 3:38:50| to be worth less today, whereas if we just let| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=13130)|
| 3:38:54| nature take its course through the tax sale item, it'll| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=13134)|
| 3:38:58| go a couple of more years, but eventually we'll be paid back for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=13138)|
| 3:39:02| You know, and if we had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=13142)|
| 3:39:06| 100 neighbors up here screaming we want it torn down and sold| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=13146)|
| 3:39:10| to somebody to build a new house, I might be more inclined to use eminent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=13150)|
| 3:39:14| domain, but the way things are, I think we just tear it down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=13154)|
| 3:39:18| and wait.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=13158)|
| 3:39:22| 11,000 to tear it down? That's what our dirty lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=13162)|
| 3:39:26| crew came back with, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=13166)|
| 3:39:30| Not that much. Well, the main cost of the tipping fees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=13170)|
| 3:39:34| is hauling the material off. That's going to be the main cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=13174)|
| 3:39:38| Yes, $6,000 in tipping fees alone. And also, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=13178)|
| 3:39:42| removing the power lines, KUB power lines and the gas meter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=13182)|
| 3:39:46| or some other costs associated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=13186)|
| 3:39:50| I'm in the wrong business. Commissioner Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=13190)|
| 3:39:54| Yeah, I just had a question. If we tear it down and just let it sit there for a couple of years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=13194)|
| 3:39:58| before it goes on a tax sale, you'll have to still maintain it, won't you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=13198)|
| 3:40:02| I mean, somebody's going to have to go out there and cut the grass and do all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=13202)|
| 3:40:06| the things to be sure no one gets hurt on it. I guess that would really be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=13206)|
| 3:40:10| the owner's responsibility, but there is some cost just to doing nothing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=13210)|
| 3:40:14| Well, it would still be overgrown. It would become a dirty lot. We'd have to go out and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=13214)|
| 3:40:18| enforce. Well, I mean, you'd be out there cutting it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=13218)|
| 3:40:22| Grant, if you talk to rural metro| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=13222)|
| 3:40:26| or anybody about burning this house down as another| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=13226)|
| 3:40:30| training program, they used to do that a lot of times, you know, and that would eliminate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=13230)|
| 3:40:34| a lot of expense there. It could. I've not done that yet, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=13234)|
| 3:40:38| We actually were thinking about doing something like that at the Fontaine property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=13238)|
| 3:40:42| as well, but that got deferred 30 days. I thought if you might contact them, it might save the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=13242)|
| 3:40:46| county some money. We can look into that. Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=13246)|
| 3:40:50| Thank you, Mr. Chair, and that's a good point, Commissioner Pinkson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=13250)|
| 3:40:54| I know several commissioners just have an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=13254)|
| 3:40:58| inherent problem with eminent domain under any circumstances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=13258)|
| 3:41:02| I spend a lot of time on KUB's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=13262)|
| 3:41:06| board of directors, and they also have power to go out and seize| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=13266)|
| 3:41:10| property under the eminent domain statute, and I was a big| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=13270)|
| 3:41:14| opponent of just kind of doing that carte blanche, and they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=13274)|
| 3:41:18| very rarely did it, but what I'm hearing today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=13278)|
| 3:41:22| it makes no sense for us not to go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=13282)|
| 3:41:26| eminent domain unless we just have fundamental differences under no circumstances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=13286)|
| 3:41:30| What we've heard is that for a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=13290)|
| 3:41:34| potential buyer, it would be better to get it under eminent domain, because you have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=13294)|
| 3:41:38| a quick claim deed, which you could potentially get a loan against.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=13298)|
| 3:41:42| We'll continue to spend| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=13302)|
| 3:41:46| county taxpayer time, money, and effort| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=13306)|
| 3:41:50| maintaining this property. We're going to pay money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=13310)|
| 3:41:54| to have it torn down, and we, from what the law director, and I agree| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=13314)|
| 3:41:58| with him, and this will remain on county tax rolls for a long| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=13318)|
| 3:42:02| time while we go searching after this mysterious| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=13322)|
| 3:42:06| owner who Mr. Rosenberg's office has been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=13326)|
| 3:42:10| trying and other entities have been trying to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=13330)|
| 3:42:14| We talk about money. We spend a lot of time talking about money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=13334)|
| 3:42:18| but then we're wanting to do this nice thing with this property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=13338)|
| 3:42:22| that we know no one's ever going to come back after| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=13342)|
| 3:42:26| because they're running from it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=13346)|
| 3:42:30| Why not? That's what I have to ask myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=13350)|
| 3:42:34| I think we should. I think this is a perfect opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090223?start=13354)|
