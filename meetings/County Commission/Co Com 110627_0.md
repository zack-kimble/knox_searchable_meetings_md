| 0:03:56| the Tennessee Responsible Vendor Act.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=236)|
| 0:03:58| Under that act, you may still impose a fine, but you may not impose a first-time suspension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=238)|
| 0:04:04| The state has the authority and it's up to the state what action they'll want to take,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=244)|
| 0:04:09| but you're limited today to fine only.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=249)|

| 0:04:25| and purchased a six-pack of Bud Light.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=265)|

| 0:04:46| I'll defer to the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=286)|
| 0:04:47| Sir, are you one of the principal owners in Rocky Top Markets, or are you just the manager of that store?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=287)|
| 0:04:53| I'm the vice president of the company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=293)|
| 0:04:55| I've been with the company for 22 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=295)|
| 0:04:58| I kind of figured you might be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=298)|
| 0:04:59| It's embarrassing to say that this is, you know, I'm standing here before you today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=299)|
| 0:05:05| Well, we know that-| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=305)|
| 0:05:07| Commissioner Brown, we need a motion for discussion, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=307)|
| 0:05:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=312)|
| 0:05:14| I'll make a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=314)|
| 0:05:16| Make a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=316)|
| 0:05:17| $500 fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=317)|
| 0:05:19| Do I have a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=319)|
| 0:05:20| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=320)|
| 0:05:21| Okay, good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=321)|
| 0:05:22| Commissioner Brown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=322)|
| 0:05:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=323)|
| 0:05:25| I know that your organization is one of the few that has a specific in-house training program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=325)|
| 0:05:36| What are the circumstances of this particular case?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=336)|
| 0:05:40| Was this a brand-new employee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=340)|
| 0:05:42| Was this somebody who had been around a while?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=342)|
| 0:05:44| Or what are the circumstances?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=344)|
| 0:05:46| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=346)|
| 0:05:47| He was a fairly new employee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=347)|
| 0:05:49| He had been through our initial training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=349)|
| 0:05:52| We are a member of the Responsible Vendor Program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=352)|
| 0:05:55| And, you know, quite frankly, according to Officer Mayne, I'd like to, you know, commend him on what he did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=355)|
| 0:06:01| He actually called us that night and made us aware of what had happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=361)|
| 0:06:06| And so that young man no longer works for us as of that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=366)|
| 0:06:10| And quite frankly, I think it was a situation, no matter what we would have done with him, he just didn't care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=370)|
| 0:06:18| And I do apologize for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=378)|
| 0:06:21| I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=381)|
| 0:06:22| And sometimes bad things happen to good people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=382)|
| 0:06:26| But in my recollection in three years up here, I don't believe we've had one of your markets up before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=386)|
| 0:06:33| I'm thinking, like I said, in 22 years, I think this is the second time I've been before this board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=393)|
| 0:06:37| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=397)|
| 0:06:38| Well, I commend you for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=398)|
| 0:06:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=399)|
| 0:06:40| And I hope you continue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=400)|
| 0:06:41| We're working on some things right now with city and county and through the Metropolitan Drug Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=401)|
| 0:06:46| to kind of beef up some of these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=406)|
| 0:06:48| So I appreciate your company's concern in this matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=408)|
| 0:06:52| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=412)|
| 0:06:53| I have a motion on the floor for a $500 fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=413)|

| 0:07:42| I'll defer to the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=462)|
| 0:07:44| A motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=464)|
| 0:07:45| A motion to a $500 fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=465)|
| 0:07:51| Or 30-day suspension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=471)|
| 0:07:53| I think you want the fine versus suspension, don't you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=473)|
| 0:07:56| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=476)|
| 0:07:57| And I also wanted to tell you that we take this very seriously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=477)|
| 0:08:00| The manager that should have followed behind her, although we were carding everyone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=480)|
| 0:08:04| we did learn if you card everyone but no one reads the under 21, that doesn't help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=484)|
| 0:08:10| We now have an in-house training program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=490)|
| 0:08:12| and we're doing everything we can to stop that from ever happening again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=492)|
| 0:08:16| I need a second for the motion, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=496)|
| 0:08:18| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=498)|
| 0:08:20| We've got a motion on the floor for a $500 fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=500)|
| 0:08:22| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=502)|
| 0:08:24| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=504)|
| 0:08:25| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=505)|
| 0:08:26| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=506)|
| 0:08:27| Mr. Chairman, I want to make this real quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=507)|
| 0:08:28| I visited with the owner here and she's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=508)|
| 0:08:31| She is very distraught that this has happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=511)|
| 0:08:33| She's trying to turn this establishment around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=513)|
| 0:08:35| She's made a lot of improvements and stuff and trying to make it more of a family-friendly atmosphere, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=515)|
| 0:08:39| And I appreciate you trying to do that, Carol.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=519)|
| 0:08:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=521)|
| 0:08:42| Thank you very much, Mr. Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=522)|
| 0:08:43| I appreciate you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=523)|
| 0:08:44| That will be paid, ma'am, within seven days to the clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=524)|
| 0:08:48| And chicken wings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=528)|
| 0:08:50| Consideration of suspension revocation of the beer permit for the following beer permittee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=530)|
| 0:08:54| which has had illegal gambling machines seized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=534)|
| 0:08:57| Fraternal Order of Eagles, 210 East Beaver Creek Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=537)|
| 0:09:00| Fraternal Order of Eagles owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=540)|
| 0:09:03| Before you begin, Wolfie, is there a representative here from the Eagles?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=543)|
| 0:09:08| Excellent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=548)|
| 0:09:09| Please proceed, Wolfie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=549)|
| 0:09:19| On May 26, 2011, I went into the Fraternal Order of Eagles at 210 East Beaver Creek Drive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=559)|
| 0:09:29| and confiscated four postage stamp gambling machines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=569)|
| 0:09:35| This is the third time in several years that I've got gambling machines out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=575)|
| 0:09:41| On 1-6 of 06, I got five Cherry Master video poker machines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=581)|
| 0:09:47| And on 9-25-05, I got nine Cherry Master video poker machines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=587)|
| 0:09:54| What was that last date that you got nine?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=594)|
| 0:09:57| 9-25-05.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=597)|
| 0:09:59| You got nine?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=599)|
| 0:10:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=601)|
| 0:10:07| It seemed like every time I go in, I find gambling machines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=607)|
| 0:10:12| And they have been told time after time that, you know, we're coming back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=612)|
| 0:10:22| And when someone calls us and tells us they have something illegal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=622)|
| 0:10:26| some of the members, I'm sure, are the ones that are calling me, telling me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=626)|
| 0:10:30| So that's the only way I would know it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=630)|
| 0:10:37| Please state your name for the record, sir, your business address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=637)|
| 0:10:41| My name is Marty Brummet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=641)|
| 0:10:43| The address for the Fraternal Order of Eagles is 210 East Beaver Creek Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=643)|
| 0:10:48| Did you hear the testimony of the officer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=648)|
| 0:10:51| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=651)|
| 0:10:52| Do you admit or deny the offense?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=652)|
| 0:10:55| I admit the offense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=655)|
| 0:10:58| May I read a short statement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=658)|
| 0:11:00| Yes, sir, you may.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=660)|
| 0:11:02| My name is Marty Brummet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=662)|
| 0:11:03| I'm the president of the Pal Fraternal Order of Eagles 3559.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=663)|
| 0:11:07| We installed a new group of officers on May the 28th, so most of them are not settled in well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=667)|
| 0:11:12| We are a non-profit, not-for-profit organization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=672)|
| 0:11:15| Our logo is people helping people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=675)|
| 0:11:18| Our purpose is mainly to generate money for many charities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=678)|
| 0:11:21| I have here, for example, a list of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=681)|
| 0:11:24| The Diabetes Research Center being built in Iowa will bear the name of Fraternal Order of Eagles| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=684)|
| 0:11:29| Diabetes Research Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=689)|
| 0:11:31| We are not a casino, and we do not want to be one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=691)|
| 0:11:34| But in our zeal to generate money for charities, we have stepped over the legal line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=694)|
| 0:11:41| We regret this and will not let it happen again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=701)|
| 0:11:44| In this economy, we have struggled to keep our doors open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=704)|
| 0:11:47| To revoke our beer license will be a death warrant to a group of well-meaning brothers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=707)|
| 0:11:51| and sisters and hurt our charities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=711)|
| 0:11:54| Please allow us to be people helping people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=714)|
| 0:11:57| Thank you for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=717)|
| 0:12:03| Mr. Chairman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=723)|
| 0:12:04| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=724)|
| 0:12:06| I think like the law director, I've been turning through this book that is in front of us that we were just presented today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=726)|
| 0:12:13| Tennessee Beer Laws and County Beer Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=733)|
| 0:12:17| There are licensing requirements, and there are distance requirements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=737)|
| 0:12:22| and there are other prohibited acts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=742)|
| 0:12:25| What are we looking at here as far as code goes that we're charging?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=745)|
| 0:12:31| Well, in this situation, they have to operate their business without any criminality.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=751)|
| 0:12:36| Under your code, although it's more designed to have suspensions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=756)|
| 0:12:41| and revocations and fines for underage sale of beer, this doesn't fall into that category,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=761)|
| 0:12:47| which means you don't have to adhere to any reasonable penalty, so you have several options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=767)|
| 0:12:52| You can revoke the license outright and let them seek redress in the courts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=772)|
| 0:12:58| You can suspend their license for a period of time to ensure that there's no ongoing criminality.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=778)|
| 0:13:08| Realistically, under your code, as it reads, you have broad discretionary powers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=788)|
| 0:13:14| everything from outright revocation of that license to suspending it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=794)|
| 0:13:19| to suspending it with a caveat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=799)|
| 0:13:22| For instance, your license is suspended for 180 days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=802)|
| 0:13:26| or in the alternative you can tell them we're going to revoke your license,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=806)|
| 0:13:30| but if you remain criminal free in six months, we won't revoke it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=810)|
| 0:13:34| So you have broad discretionary powers here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=814)|
| 0:13:36| What you feel would remedy the situation before you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=816)|
| 0:13:40| And then that leads me into my next question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=820)|
| 0:13:43| Are we awaiting some court action to determine criminality here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=823)|
| 0:13:49| There is no court action in Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=829)|
| 0:13:51| I believe that Wolfie just goes in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=831)|
| 0:13:53| It's a civil process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=833)|
| 0:13:55| Has anybody been charged in anything, Wolfie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=835)|
| 0:13:59| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=839)|
| 0:14:01| On the gambling machines, they're illegal in the state of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=841)|
| 0:14:05| The machines or the parts, anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=845)|
| 0:14:08| So just possession of them makes it confiscatable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=848)|
| 0:14:12| They're on their face illegal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=852)|
| 0:14:14| You can't even.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=854)|
| 0:14:15| Prima facie, is that a good word?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=855)|
| 0:14:17| I've used it all the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=857)|
| 0:14:18| I like it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=858)|
| 0:14:19| But you're right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=859)|
| 0:14:20| It's a good question, Commissioner, because at this point, no,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=860)|
| 0:14:22| there is no pending criminal court case before the criminal courts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=862)|
| 0:14:25| or before the state attorney's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=865)|
| 0:14:28| So you have to look at it from a nuisance standpoint as to what you feel you're comfortable with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=868)|
| 0:14:34| How many offenses have they had in the window that we look at?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=874)|
| 0:14:38| In the ten-year, three in ten years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=878)|
| 0:14:44| Three confiscations in ten years, is that correct, Wolfie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=884)|
| 0:14:47| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=887)|
| 0:14:49| Do you know when the most recent one was, Wolfie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=889)|
| 0:14:52| May the 26th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=892)|
| 0:14:56| Prior to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=896)|
| 0:14:59| The most recent one was?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=899)|
| 0:15:03| May 26, 2011.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=903)|
| 0:15:05| And prior to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=905)|
| 0:15:06| One-sixth of 06, 925 of 05.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=906)|
| 0:15:13| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=913)|
| 0:15:16| Since this is the third offense, I'm going to make a motion that their beer permit be suspended for a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=916)|
| 0:15:27| And if there's any problem in the meantime, revoke permanently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=927)|
| 0:15:35| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=935)|
| 0:15:37| Can you do a suspension and a fine, both, Mr. Law Director?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=937)|
| 0:15:44| Normally you choose either or, but, again, that is for when you're dealing with underage drinking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=944)|
| 0:15:51| But conceivably, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=951)|
| 0:15:56| Commissioner Brown, I was looking at, you know, we're doing this the third time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=956)|
| 0:15:58| Usually we do $500 every time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=958)|
| 0:16:00| I'm looking at $1,500.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=960)|
| 0:16:02| So, you know, do what you're saying with the $1,500.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=962)|
| 0:16:05| $1,500 fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=965)|
| 0:16:06| Yep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=966)|
| 0:16:07| Motion on the floor currently is a one-year suspension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=967)|
| 0:16:10| I'll second that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=970)|
| 0:16:11| Do I have a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=971)|
| 0:16:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=973)|
| 0:16:14| Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=974)|
| 0:16:16| What were the fines or the penalties on the three previous?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=976)|
| 0:16:23| Do we have a record of that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=983)|
| 0:16:25| I don't believe it was addressed and brought before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=985)|
| 0:16:29| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=989)|
| 0:16:30| Do you know?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=990)|
| 0:16:31| I only bring them on the third time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=991)|
| 0:16:33| Only on the third time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=993)|
| 0:16:34| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=994)|
| 0:16:35| Was there a fine the third time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=995)|
| 0:16:38| This is the third time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=998)|
| 0:16:39| Oh, this is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=999)|
| 0:16:39| So, 2000, this is 2000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=999)|
| 0:16:44| There was no instance in 2011.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=1004)|
| 0:16:47| This was the third.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=1007)|

| 0:16:50| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=1010)|
| 0:16:51| I got you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=1011)|
| 0:16:52| I believe it was 05, 06, and then 2011.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=1012)|
| 0:16:55| I got you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=1015)|
| 0:16:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=1016)|
| 0:16:57| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=1017)|
| 0:16:58| Well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=1018)|
| 0:17:00| I'd like to make a quick statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=1020)|
| 0:17:03| Sometime last year we revoked a or suspended a permit for 120 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=1023)|
| 0:17:08| And the judge overruled that down to 92 days, which was the points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=1028)|
| 0:17:12| And that was excessive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=1032)|
| 0:17:13| But I just wanted to let you all be aware of that, that it was brought before us on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=1033)|
| 0:17:19| So, Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=1039)|
| 0:17:20| I have a question of the applicant with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=1040)|
| 0:17:22| The year, will that put you out of business?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=1042)|
| 0:17:25| Most likely it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=1045)|
| 0:17:28| Suspending the beer license is going to close the doors in about a month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=1048)|
| 0:17:42| Well, this is third offense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=1062)|
| 0:17:49| What I'm saying over here on the side is I do not think that we ought to put them out of business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=1069)|
| 0:17:54| If we've lost, I mean, if people have gone to court on us and got their license back on the day they were in court,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=1074)|
| 0:18:05| I believe that the $500 fine would sit better with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=1085)|
| 0:18:09| Well, but same token, we're not in the business of putting people in business to operate illegally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=1089)|
| 0:18:16| And that's what we would be doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=1096)|
| 0:18:18| I think the gentleman stated that he would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=1098)|
| 0:18:24| It won't happen again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=1104)|
| 0:18:25| Well, no, I was going to back you up to there's been a change in leadership in the business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=1105)|
| 0:18:30| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=1110)|

| 0:18:37| I'd like to make a substitute motion as the chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=1117)|
| 0:18:39| Commissioner, let me go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=1119)|

| 0:18:55| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=1135)|
| 0:18:59| Commissioner, you're on me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=1139)|
| 0:19:01| I'll withdraw the original so we don't have to go around it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=1141)|
| 0:19:07| So you're withdrawing your motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=1147)|
| 0:19:09| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=1149)|

| 0:19:16| Larry's second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=1156)|
| 0:19:17| Motion on the floor is a $1,000 fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=1157)|
| 0:19:19| And the next time you come before this board or I'll let you know, I'll be here until 2016.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=1159)|

| 0:19:27| So I will recommend you to be revoked if you come back for gambling machines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=1167)|
| 0:19:31| There's other ways to raise your money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=1171)|
| 0:19:33| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=1173)|

| 0:24:41| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=1481)|
| 0:24:42| Before we go forward, and for public knowledge and for those of you who are not aware,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=1482)|
| 0:24:44| today we only have eight members present, but it will still require six affirmative votes to pass anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=1484)|
| 0:24:48| So kind of remember that as we're going through the day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=1488)|
| 0:24:52| First off, we have public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=1492)|
| 0:24:54| David Williams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=1494)|
| 0:24:56| Mr. David Williams, are you here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=1496)|
| 0:24:57| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=1497)|
| 0:25:00| Joel Albans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=1500)|
| 0:25:03| Joel Albans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=1503)|
| 0:25:09| Mr. Baugh, Albert Baugh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=1509)|
| 0:25:14| Albert, you're batting 1,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=1514)|
| 0:25:16| I am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=1516)|
| 0:25:17| Brad Mays.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=1517)|
| 0:25:20| If I might speak from the bench here, that will allow me to use my computer as an assistant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=1520)|
| 0:25:26| 146, you have five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=1526)|
| 0:25:27| Name and address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=1527)|
| 0:25:28| My name is Bradley J. Mays.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=1528)|
| 0:25:30| I live at 1817 Plum Branch Road, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37932.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=1530)|
| 0:25:38| The first thing I'd like to cover with you all is back when Rodney Rocket resigned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=1538)|
| 0:25:42| he contacted me and informed me that some e-mails had been sent using the identity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=1542)|
| 0:25:50| bradatplumcreek.com, and Mr. Rocket claims that he witnessed Mr. Salter create these e-mails| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=1550)|
| 0:25:57| and send them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=1557)|
| 0:25:59| I filed an open records request for these e-mails, and the county refused to turn them over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=1559)|
| 0:26:05| I do, however, did get Mr. Salter to admit at least one e-mail existed because we have a copy of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=1565)|
| 0:26:13| The content of the e-mail is before you commissioners, but it's not appropriate to read for the vulgarity of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=1573)|
| 0:26:24| And after we got this e-mail, we spoke to Mr. Salter about it under oath.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=1584)|
| 0:26:30| And when we asked him about this, we said, question, you at one point in time would want to have discredited Mr. Mays.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=1590)|
| 0:26:37| Is that fair to say?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=1597)|
| 0:26:39| Answer, not really.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=1599)|
| 0:26:42| Question, when you sent this monk e-mail that you knew Mr. Mays had not created to David Draper,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=1602)|
| 0:26:47| is it fair to say you wanted to discredit Mr. Mays?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=1607)|
| 0:26:51| Answer, no, I just thought it was funny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=1611)|
| 0:26:55| Question, do you recall the content of the monk message?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=1615)|
| 0:27:00| Answer, not exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=1620)|
| 0:27:02| Question, what do you recall it to be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=1622)|
| 0:27:06| And the answer has some explicit language in it, so I'm not going to repeat it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=1626)|
| 0:27:11| Question, anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=1631)|
| 0:27:13| Answer, that's mostly what I remember about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=1633)|
| 0:27:16| Question, did it use the phrase?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=1636)|
| 0:27:18| And I'm not going to repeat that phrase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=1638)|
| 0:27:22| And he answered, I don't remember that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=1642)|
| 0:27:25| Question, do you remember it being very vulgar?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=1645)|
| 0:27:29| And he answered, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=1649)|
| 0:27:32| In the Pam Rees report and also in another location in his deposition, Mr. Salter claimed that he simply forwarded this e-mail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=1652)|
| 0:27:40| However, if you go back to the first page, you will see that the e-mail was sent directly from an identity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=1660)|
| 0:27:46| Brad at Plum Creek dot com, directly to a David Draper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=1666)|
| 0:27:51| It doesn't show that it was sent from Brad to Tom and then forwarded from Tom to David Draper,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=1671)|
| 0:27:57| which is consistent with what Mr. Rockett has testified to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=1677)|
| 0:28:00| that he personally witnessed Mr. Salter creating these and sending them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=1680)|
| 0:28:05| This was done immediately preceding a mediated settlement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=1685)|
| 0:28:09| I tried to tell everybody that I did not send these, and I was strongly discredited by this e-mail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=1689)|
| 0:28:15| And in my opinion, this activity is what caused your Solid Waste Department to sign a settlement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=1695)|
| 0:28:22| for giving all finances, all claims, known and unknown, whatsoever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=1702)|
| 0:28:28| for any money, known and unknown, owed by Natural Resources to Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=1708)|
| 0:28:35| I now have somebody to admit under oath I didn't send these e-mails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=1715)|
| 0:28:40| And I think it's important that you commissioners know this so that I can regain some of my credibility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=1720)|
| 0:28:45| when I speak before this commission when you're voting on things that impact this county by millions of dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=1725)|
| 0:28:53| Also, I'd like a brief moment to read a section, another section of his deposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=1733)|
| 0:28:59| This is prior to the mediated settlement where Mr. Salter claimed in the mediated settlement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=1739)|
| 0:29:02| he had investigated my claims of contaminated mulch, and my claims were completely untrue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=1742)|
| 0:29:08| I got a hold of some of their lab tests that Mr. Salter's office had ran.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=1748)|
| 0:29:14| Question, so in March 2008, you knew that the product in the sales bins at Natural Resources Recovery| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=1754)|
| 0:29:19| had extremely high levels of fecal coliform.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=1759)|
| 0:29:22| Answer, right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=1762)|
| 0:29:24| Question, 1,000 times the limit for the EPA for fecal coliform.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=1764)|
| 0:29:28| Answer, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=1768)|
| 0:29:29| Question, correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=1769)|
| 0:29:30| Answer, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=1770)|
| 0:29:31| And you had that material pulled off the market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=1771)|
| 0:29:34| Answer, that's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=1774)|
| 0:29:36| How much of it was sold before you had it pulled off the market?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=1776)|
| 0:29:40| Answer, I have no idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=1780)|
| 0:29:42| Question, did you ask?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=1782)|
| 0:29:44| Answer, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=1784)|
| 0:29:45| Question, did you inform the public that contaminated mulch had been sold to the public with fecal coliform?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=1785)|
| 0:29:52| Answer, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=1792)|
| 0:29:53| Did you inform county commission that contaminated mulch with fecal coliform had been sold to the public?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=1793)|
| 0:29:59| Answer, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=1799)|
| 0:30:00| Well, I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=1800)|
| 0:30:02| I don't know about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=1802)|
| 0:30:03| We may have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=1803)|
| 0:30:04| There may have been some commissioners we told.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=1804)|
| 0:30:06| That I don't remember.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=1806)|
| 0:30:08| Question, but you agree with me earlier that you had told commissioner there was nothing wrong with the mulch, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=1808)|
| 0:30:16| Mr. Mays, you've got 30 seconds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=1816)|
| 0:30:19| Answer, well, after this incident, I contacted our expert, Joel Alpert, just to answer the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=1819)|
| 0:30:26| You told commission there was nothing wrong with the mulch after you had these lab tests.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=1826)|
| 0:30:30| Answer, that's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=1830)|
| 0:30:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=1834)|
| 0:30:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=1835)|
| 0:30:38| You'll speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=1838)|
| 0:30:40| Dr. Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=1840)|
| 0:30:44| He's going to come back before public forum on contract extension, so you'll have time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=1844)|
| 0:30:49| I think I will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=1849)|
| 0:30:50| I think I do want to say something is that, you know, Brad has come down here before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=1850)|
| 0:30:54| And this is a sworn deposition, and I assume that this is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=1854)|
| 0:30:59| But he's been criticized by members of this commission as being inappropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=1859)|
| 0:31:06| And in the past, we actually passed a resolution that said that the commission would do nothing to attempt to discredit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=1866)|
| 0:31:16| or to tell a citizen that or discourage a citizen from coming before this commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=1876)|
| 0:31:24| And I'd just like to point out that both in the Reeves report and in the audit report that we received on April the 26th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=1884)|
| 0:31:33| we found almost a half a million dollars, $500,000 that the county did not receive that was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=1893)|
| 0:31:40| and I'll give credit for it, that was pointed out by Brad Mays.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=1900)|
| 0:31:44| And I'll tell you, Brad is like a rock in your shoe if you're here at this, you know, working for the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=1904)|
| 0:31:51| because he's pointed out a lot of things that everyone's very uncomfortable with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=1911)|
| 0:31:55| But you can't deny that there was $500,000 that we never would have known about if he hadn't brought that forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=1915)|
| 0:32:01| And once he brought that forward, the whole process changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=1921)|
| 0:32:07| And this would probably still be going on today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=1927)|
| 0:32:12| And I think it's important to remember that, because I know a lot of people roll their eyes, they sort of laugh,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=1932)|
| 0:32:16| they make fun, but that is a fact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=1936)|
| 0:32:20| I'd like to say one thing real quick in response, Mr. Briggs, also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=1940)|
| 0:32:25| We recently became aware that at some point in time there was, it was described by his co-worker,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=1945)|
| 0:32:31| a voodoo doll of me hanging in Mr. Salter's office with the name of a commissioner wrote across the chest of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=1951)|
| 0:32:37| And we asked him about this, and he admitted that the doll was, in fact, there at some point hanging in his office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=1957)|
| 0:32:43| I don't think he referred to it as a voodoo doll, but I've actually had a doll of me hung in their office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=1963)|
| 0:32:50| with a commissioner's name wrote on the chest of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=1970)|
| 0:32:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=1976)|
| 0:32:57| Thank you, Mr. Mays.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=1977)|
| 0:33:00| Mr. Chairman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=1980)|
| 0:33:01| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=1981)|
| 0:33:02| Whenever you get the, one of the people who asked for public forum has just walked in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=1982)|
| 0:33:06| Mr. Williams?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=1986)|
| 0:33:07| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=1987)|
| 0:33:08| Mr. Williams, you're going to come forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=1988)|
| 0:33:09| David Williams?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=1989)|
| 0:33:12| I want to talk about Brad, will you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=1992)|
| 0:33:14| Mr. Chairman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=1994)|
| 0:33:15| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=1995)|

| 0:33:35| A lot of this stuff has been going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=2015)|
| 0:33:36| Brad has been, Brad, you came to my office over six years ago, and we've been working on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=2016)|
| 0:33:43| And I'm just not comfortable with it, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=2023)|
| 0:33:48| I'm not comfortable one little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=2028)|
| 0:33:50| It seems like we're stalling, we're stalling, and we're covering up, and we're covering up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=2030)|
| 0:33:55| and we've got some really hard evidence about some things, and we've had some hard evidence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=2035)|
| 0:33:59| and I just hope that, you know, you guys stay on top of it, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=2039)|
| 0:34:04| I can tell you, Tim Burch at 6401 Airtree, I can tell you we're not stalling,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=2044)|
| 0:34:11| and we're not covering up for anybody, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=2051)|
| 0:34:14| Everything is going to be, I ran on transparency, and we're going to get it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=2054)|
| 0:34:18| and we're going to get it all resolved, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=2058)|
| 0:34:21| I mean, something needs to be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=2061)|
| 0:34:23| This is just my opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=2063)|
| 0:34:24| That's a natural fact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=2064)|
| 0:34:25| Something needs to be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=2065)|
| 0:34:26| It needs to be done when it needs to be happened swift.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=2066)|
| 0:34:29| It needs to be decisive because we need to send some message out to other county employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=2069)|
| 0:34:34| You know, we've had some other things that have happened over the week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=2074)|
| 0:34:36| and this to me seems to be a lot more damaging, and we seem to let this just go on by.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=2076)|
| 0:34:43| So, you're the man, and, you know, let's do what we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=2083)|
| 0:34:47| I want to restore confidence back to the other Knox County employees that work here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=2087)|

| 0:35:09| showing some aspects of the Pond Gap community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=2109)|

| 0:35:40| And the Ringing Brothers Circus in the 40s and West High School, of course, in 51.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=2140)|

| 0:38:55| I called last week to have this added, and the Sequoia Library has been a center stone in this community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=2335)|
| 0:39:04| in the Sequoia community for 50 years, and that's a big accomplishment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=2344)|
| 0:39:10| As it was stated in here, or something I found out actually, that it was built for $70,000, I believe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=2350)|
| 0:39:20| and that's a pretty cheap library, but not cheap in history or what it brings to that community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=2360)|
| 0:39:28| Last week when their power went out, I received so many phone calls about when is KUB going to get their power back on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=2368)|
| 0:39:35| so they can go to the library.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=2375)|
| 0:39:37| That's how vital this library is and has been for 50 years to this community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=2377)|
| 0:39:42| So I wanted to recognize them on a big accomplishment and for many years to come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=2382)|

| 0:59:16| Thanks, Dwight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=3556)|
| 0:59:18| I just had difficulty finding information about this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=3558)|
| 0:59:21| You said you'd get us some details.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=3561)|
| 0:59:25| I guess it starts with where is it exactly, Ridgeland Drive, and then what type of development is it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=3565)|
| 0:59:33| I've been out of town, Commissioner, so I haven't checked this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=3573)|
| 0:59:35| Is it not available online?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=3575)|
| 0:59:37| I wasn't able to access it online, so I was just curious about some parts of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=3577)|
| 0:59:43| just in reference to the stormwater issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=3583)|
| 0:59:46| I actually don't know any of the details on this one specifically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=3586)|
| 0:59:50| Now, if Mr. Snowden does, why don't you read it since you don't need glasses?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=3590)|
| 0:59:58| This is Jim Snowden, 205 West Baxter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=3598)|
| 1:00:01| Commissioner Norman, I'm not real sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=3601)|
| 1:00:03| It does say it's for the final plat of Campbell Station Villa Phase 2,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=3603)|
| 1:00:07| so I don't really have a lot of information on it, but I know it is for Campbell Station Villas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=3607)|
| 1:00:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=3612)|
| 1:00:13| Is there information on Campbell Station Road?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=3613)|
| 1:00:16| I don't know, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=3616)|
| 1:00:17| I would have to check and get back with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=3617)|
| 1:00:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=3619)|
| 1:00:20| So I assume that it's on the part of Campbell Station that is north of the interstate over the hill?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=3620)|
| 1:00:27| Well, actually, the county's portion doesn't pick up until north of Black Road, up there at the four-way stop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=3627)|
| 1:00:33| But I will check and let you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=3633)|
| 1:00:35| But I do not know the specifics of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=3635)|
| 1:00:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=3637)|
| 1:00:38| And in MPC, staff recommendations, I mean, do we have recommendations from MPC in relation to this one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=3638)|
| 1:00:48| Not to my knowledge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=3648)|
| 1:00:49| Just looking at this document, it looks like it's just a standard maintenance agreement from the owner to the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=3649)|
| 1:00:57| So I'm not sure of the specifics of that, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=3657)|
| 1:01:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=3660)|
| 1:01:01| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=3661)|

| 1:02:11| Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=3731)|
| 1:02:13| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=3733)|
| 1:02:15| Mr. Wayne Decker was here earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=3735)|
| 1:02:18| He may want to speak to this if we have questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=3738)|
| 1:02:21| I believe some of the questions that were raised the other day had to deal with this is a state grant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=3741)|
| 1:02:26| and they need a vehicle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=3746)|
| 1:02:27| Get it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=3747)|
| 1:02:28| Get it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=3748)|
| 1:02:29| Vehicle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=3749)|
| 1:02:30| DOT grant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=3750)|
| 1:02:31| Good job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=3751)|
| 1:02:32| They need a vehicle to get the money from the state to the end user.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=3752)|
| 1:02:36| A part of this is a 20% local match.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=3756)|
| 1:02:39| That is not a match by local Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=3759)|
| 1:02:42| That is a match by the local organization, Ramsey House.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=3762)|
| 1:02:46| So this is all strictly passed through as far as we're concerned with local tax dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=3766)|
| 1:02:54| If there are any questions, I'm sure that Mr. Decker will be free to answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=3774)|

| 1:03:09| I live at 5409 Doublewood Way, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37918.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=3789)|
| 1:03:17| We are extremely excited at the Ramsey House to be able to get this TDOT grant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=3797)|
| 1:03:22| It's really going to revitalize our facilities up there, be able to where we can have more events,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=3802)|
| 1:03:30| and be able to show off Ramsey House in a much better way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=3810)|
| 1:03:35| And I would appreciate your support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=3815)|

| 1:04:38| Brad, were you wanting to speak on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=3878)|
| 1:04:42| I think I'll wait until last to speak so I have a chance to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=3882)|
| 1:04:46| Anybody else who wants to speak to the contract?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=3886)|
| 1:04:52| Mr. King, do you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=3892)|
| 1:04:57| I'm here on behalf of the current provider of service and current occupant of the premises.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=3897)|
| 1:05:03| I guess I'm more interested in seeing whether there's any opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=3903)|
| 1:05:06| And if so, I might like to address that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=3906)|
| 1:05:08| But if we have a motion and a second, it suits me fine just to go ahead and have the vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=3908)|
| 1:05:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=3915)|
| 1:05:17| Mr. Mase, it's 226.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=3917)|
| 1:05:20| You have five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=3920)|
| 1:05:26| The county has spent a great deal of our proceeds to investigate the allegations I've made against Natural Resources Recovery.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=3926)|
| 1:05:35| Pam Reeves has confirmed in her report that John Evans gave them permission to sell material| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=3935)|
| 1:05:39| that did not meet the regulatory requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=3939)|
| 1:05:44| Tom Salter has admitted they sold material that was highly contaminated with fecal coliform, salmonella, E. coli,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=3944)|
| 1:05:51| all kinds of stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=3951)|
| 1:05:53| The public wasn't warned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=3953)|
| 1:05:55| Your auditor has audited their contract and found several hundred thousand dollars that the county was shortchanged.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=3955)|
| 1:06:05| We have confirmed that this material was sold to the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=3965)|
| 1:06:10| In addition to this, this contractor disposed of coal ash that was not supposed to be mixed with retail products,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=3970)|
| 1:06:17| yet it was and sold to the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=3977)|
| 1:06:21| They're asking for emergency contract extension to avoid having to shut the facility down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=3981)|
| 1:06:28| What they're failing to realize is if someone other than them buys the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=3988)|
| 1:06:33| you have to shut it down anyway next month for them to move out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=3993)|
| 1:06:37| Where did you avoid something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=3997)|
| 1:06:38| They're asking you for an emergency, to award them an emergency contract for 60 days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=3998)|
| 1:06:44| without putting it out for bid after they've done this to our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=4004)|
| 1:06:49| They're asking you to give them an emergency contract for 60 days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=4009)|
| 1:06:53| so that we don't have to close this facility down and then it's going to auction in a couple of weeks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=4013)|
| 1:06:58| and if someone else buys it, guess what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=4018)|
| 1:07:01| They've got to vacate and close it down anyway temporarily while we change ownership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=4021)|
| 1:07:06| Another problem that concerns me is if you visit the facility, there's a large mass of unground material,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=4026)|
| 1:07:14| green waste, logs, stumps, piled to the heavens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=4034)|
| 1:07:18| If they don't win this contract or the next bidder or if somebody else buys the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=4038)|
| 1:07:25| what's to prevent them from bankrupting the Tennessee LLC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=4045)|
| 1:07:28| and walking off and leaving this mountain of storm waste on Knox County's hands to clean up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=4048)|
| 1:07:36| Now you think about that question and the hundreds of thousands of dollars that could cost the taxpayers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=4056)|
| 1:07:40| and weigh that against their track history and then ask if you want to take a gamble with this company again| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=4060)|
| 1:07:46| after we've been embarrassed so many times| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=4066)|
| 1:07:49| and give them an emergency 60-day contract extension so the taxpayers can take it in the end again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=4069)|
| 1:07:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=4076)|
| 1:08:00| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=4080)|
| 1:08:01| I've got a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=4081)|
| 1:08:02| I don't know, maybe to the administration or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=4082)|
| 1:08:04| Commissioners, I emailed Randy Graves to see if he would be interested in putting a bid on this for a couple of months| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=4084)|
| 1:08:11| and he said he would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=4091)|
| 1:08:12| I was wondering if the administration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=4092)|
| 1:08:14| Tim, did you hear from anybody else that wants to put a bid on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=4094)|
| 1:08:20| Tim Burch at 6401 Airtree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=4100)|
| 1:08:22| I haven't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=4102)|
| 1:08:23| But I have a question, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=4103)|
| 1:08:24| How could somebody get a permit within this amount of time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=4104)|
| 1:08:29| I mean, basically an overnight permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=4109)|
| 1:08:32| I just think it's impossible knowing the permitting process through the state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=4112)|
| 1:08:39| for them to locate in another facility and be able to permit it overnight, basically,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=4119)|
| 1:08:45| because right now we're in a situation with these storms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=4125)|
| 1:08:48| I understood that over 120 vehicles a day were coming through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=4128)|
| 1:08:53| I mean, I understand people's frustration with this situation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=4133)|
| 1:08:58| but we're kind of in a different situation right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=4138)|
| 1:09:02| That's all we're asking for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=4142)|
| 1:09:03| Do you have to have a permit just to do mulch?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=4143)|
| 1:09:06| Yes, you do, under the state laws, for what I understand from my brief history in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=4146)|
| 1:09:19| I think the mayor may have made a minor mistake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=4159)|
| 1:09:22| In the mediated settlement and in the Reeves report,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=4162)|
| 1:09:25| there are documents in this case that states that there are no permits required to only grind green waste.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=4165)|
| 1:09:32| In addition to that, Knox County has other businesses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=4172)|
| 1:09:35| with identical facilities that provide the same services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=4175)|
| 1:09:39| Thank you, Mr. Mason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=4179)|
| 1:09:41| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=4181)|
| 1:09:42| You know, that's just where, you know, Tim,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=4182)|
| 1:09:44| I feel that we're sort of caught between a rock and a hard place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=4184)|
| 1:09:46| We're asking for a 30-day extension, Commissioner, and that's all we're asking for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=4186)|
| 1:09:51| We're not asking to move mountains here in just 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=4191)|
| 1:09:54| I understand that, but I still go back to what I mean.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=4194)|
| 1:09:57| With me, it's the principle of the thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=4197)|
| 1:10:00| These people have hooded us for years, and I'm just not comfortable with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=4200)|
| 1:10:05| But, you know, we're caught catch 22, so I'm still thinking about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=4205)|
| 1:10:11| Mr. Mase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=4211)|
| 1:10:12| Mr. Mase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=4212)|
| 1:10:13| Not on the dais.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=4213)|
| 1:10:14| Here, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=4214)|
| 1:10:17| My name is Kenneth Frazier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=4217)|
| 1:10:18| I live at 7700 Gleason Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=4218)|
| 1:10:22| I was going to be a bidder on this place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=4222)|
| 1:10:27| I was just wondering if you guys give an extension and actually buy the place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=4227)|
| 1:10:32| would I have to let them come in and grind the mulch and move it after I'd actually closed on the place?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=4232)|
| 1:10:39| They have a certain amount of time that they would have to turn it over to you and get everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=4239)|
| 1:10:44| They have specifications of the lot, what it's supposed to look like when the new owner takes over,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=4244)|
| 1:10:48| and there's a specified time at the closing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=4248)|
| 1:10:51| What is that specified time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=4251)|
| 1:10:52| Do you know?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=4252)|
| 1:10:54| John, do you remember the 45 days, 45-day turnover after the auction to close?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=4254)|
| 1:11:01| I think it's 45 days after the auction or 45 days after the commission accepts the bid?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=4261)|
| 1:11:07| Because the auction is about ten days or two weeks before the commission meets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=4267)|
| 1:11:10| I think Hugh Holt's shaking his head.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=4270)|
| 1:11:11| It's after the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=4271)|
| 1:11:13| After commission, it's 45 days to close.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=4273)|
| 1:11:15| Very clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=4275)|
| 1:11:18| Commissioner Riggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=4278)|
| 1:11:20| Yeah, I just had a comment on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=4280)|
| 1:11:22| And I think the fact that there's another bidder here makes a good point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=4282)|
| 1:11:26| is that once the deal is closed, I think the people that have the property would like to get on there and get to work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=4286)|
| 1:11:32| And if you have, if they're trying to get moved on and the other people are trying to get moved out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=4292)|
| 1:11:36| it's sort of like moving into a house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=4296)|
| 1:11:38| It would be a lot easier to move in if the people that are there are already gone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=4298)|
| 1:11:42| And, again, I don't know if the Riggs report is correct or incorrect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=4302)|
| 1:11:47| But it says here that this was the RFP that was issued by Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=4307)|
| 1:11:51| It says that no permit is required for mulching.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=4311)|
| 1:11:54| I don't know if that's true or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=4314)|
| 1:11:55| A permit is required for composting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=4315)|
| 1:11:58| And I want to make, I still have the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=4318)|
| 1:12:01| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=4321)|
| 1:12:02| I want to make another point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=4322)|
| 1:12:03| You know, this, the motion that we made was between 30 and 60 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=4323)|
| 1:12:08| And that's, you know, a pretty broad piece of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=4328)|
| 1:12:12| I think we need to specify that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=4332)|
| 1:12:14| And I don't know if I need to make a substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=4334)|
| 1:12:17| I will make a substitute motion that we make it for 31 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=4337)|
| 1:12:21| And the reason I take 31 days is that that will take it till the end of August,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=4341)|
| 1:12:26| because August is a 31-day month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=4346)|
| 1:12:29| And also that would leave about a week, roughly a week or a little bit more,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=4349)|
| 1:12:33| between the time the commission would approve the sale of the property before the new owner would take possession.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=4353)|
| 1:12:43| It's a mute point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=4363)|
| 1:12:45| If NRR wins the bid, if they're going to stay there, it really doesn't matter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=4365)|
| 1:12:50| because that's going to be there permanently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=4370)|
| 1:12:52| But if there's just like that gentleman that got up there to speak,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=4372)|
| 1:12:55| if he wants to get on there, then he'll be able to get on there within his 45 days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=4375)|
| 1:13:00| without having to deal with somebody else, you know, trying to get off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=4380)|
| 1:13:04| Because I think after he owns the property, he shouldn't have to wait for somebody else to come on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=4384)|
| 1:13:09| you know, for somebody else to get off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=4389)|
| 1:13:11| I mean, that's, you know, that's his property 45 days after the commission votes on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=4391)|
| 1:13:16| And I will make, I think that there is a good point about this being an emergency resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=4396)|
| 1:13:23| and an emergency contract where it's not being put out for bid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=4403)|
| 1:13:28| You know, it's sort of a technical legal point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=4408)|
| 1:13:31| I think it's a precedent that we really have to be careful if we're calling this an emergency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=4411)|
| 1:13:36| You know, I guess you could say with the storms we do need to get things, you know, things ground up and moved on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=4416)|
| 1:13:45| I don't think that we should delay the sale on this any longer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=4425)|
| 1:13:51| You know, the ultimate question on this as to how we vote on it should come to what is in the best interest of the taxpayer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=4431)|
| 1:13:58| because that's ultimately our client and who we represent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=4438)|
| 1:14:02| And I think for us to draw, rather than just saying it's over at the end of July| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=4442)|
| 1:14:07| and then having that month of August where the county gets no revenue at all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=4447)|
| 1:14:12| and the place is sitting there with nothing happening until the 45 days are up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=4452)|
| 1:14:18| I think it's in the best interest financially of the county to extend this 31 days, get that month's rent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=4458)|
| 1:14:24| and then get the new owner on there within a week or two after that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=4464)|
| 1:14:29| And what I do is I support, make a motion, substitute motion for a 31-day extension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=4469)|
| 1:14:35| Yes, substitute motion is second on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=4475)|
| 1:14:37| Commissioner Shouse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=4477)|
| 1:14:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=4478)|
| 1:14:39| Commissioner Briggs, 31 days from 30 days from now or from right now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=4479)|
| 1:14:43| That would be end of July, wouldn't it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=4483)|
| 1:14:45| No, see, their contract takes them until the end of July.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=4485)|
| 1:14:51| So basically what you're doing is giving them the full month of August and August is 31-day month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=4491)|
| 1:14:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=4496)|
| 1:14:57| And so by the extension of the contract would end on August 31| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=4497)|
| 1:15:02| and they would have to be off by September 1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=4502)|
| 1:15:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=4504)|
| 1:15:05| I got it then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=4505)|
| 1:15:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=4506)|
| 1:15:07| I'm obviously completely enamored with national resources recovery after the audit reports and so forth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=4507)|
| 1:15:14| but they're what we've got right now and the mayor alluded to it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=4514)|
| 1:15:17| and some other people have alluded to it with hundreds if not thousands of cubic yards of trees stacked everywhere| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=4517)|
| 1:15:23| in people's yards and at the convenience centers and side of the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=4523)|
| 1:15:27| I think it would be a tremendous barrel to just throw these guys out as soon as we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=4527)|
| 1:15:33| I see no choice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=4533)|
| 1:15:36| I mean, Dwight Vandermate might have the answer to that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=4536)|
| 1:15:38| but I don't see any choice because of the situation we're in just because of the overwhelming amount of green material| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=4538)|
| 1:15:46| out there that needs to be placed somewhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=4546)|
| 1:15:49| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=4549)|
| 1:15:52| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=4552)|
| 1:15:55| We're kind of caught here because of the storm situation, a rock in a hard place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=4555)|
| 1:16:02| A couple of people mentioned there's other people in town that are doing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=4562)|
| 1:16:06| How far are you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=4566)|
| 1:16:07| I'm assuming, sir, that you're grinding now also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=4567)|
| 1:16:11| You're in the business now or just wanting to get in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=4571)|
| 1:16:14| Already in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=4574)|
| 1:16:15| How far are you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=4575)|
| 1:16:16| Wanting to get in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=4576)|
| 1:16:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=4578)|
| 1:16:20| We're talking about how big of a pile stacked up out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=4580)|
| 1:16:23| Is that going to be able to be done before the end of July?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=4583)|
| 1:16:28| If we said, okay, we're not going to do this, can they clear that by the end of July?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=4588)|
| 1:16:35| Or we've got 15 more days after that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=4595)|
| 1:16:39| Well, actually you have from July.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=4599)|
| 1:16:43| Well, if it's sold on the 13th, then basically mid-August you're going to have to be totally gone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=4603)|
| 1:16:48| Right, John?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=4608)|
| 1:16:51| If we're talking about the substitute motion, you know, you've got one kind of a timetable related to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=4611)|
| 1:17:01| It's John King, PO Box 2425, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37901.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=4621)|
| 1:17:06| If you're talking about the original motion, then you've got a different timetable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=4626)|
| 1:17:12| And Commissioner Brown, I don't know how to answer your question, but let me just say this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=4632)|
| 1:17:17| If you put it to a point where they've got to be off by the end of August, let's say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=4637)|
| 1:17:31| they're going to, in essence, have to shut that facility down days prior, many days prior to that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=4651)|
| 1:17:38| in order to accomplish it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=4658)|
| 1:17:42| Now, that's the reason you have to tie these times to what that ultimate purchaser is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=4662)|
| 1:17:50| or who it is as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=4670)|
| 1:17:52| You need to keep all of that in mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=4672)|
| 1:17:55| What I wanted to do was speak to the original motion, which was 30 days with a one-time potential 30-day extension| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=4675)|
| 1:18:04| at the sole discretion of the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=4684)|
| 1:18:08| There are a number of reasons why that is a good idea, and it didn't originate with NRR.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=4688)|
| 1:18:17| First of all, the county has certain remediation obligations, site work, if you will,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=4697)|
| 1:18:26| that they have to accomplish before they can transfer this property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=4706)|
| 1:18:29| and that relates to two ponds, predominantly two ponds on the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=4709)|
| 1:18:35| They've got to do certain cleaning and efforts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=4715)|
| 1:18:38| I think, I believe I'm correct, that the county probably has entered into a contract to have that done, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=4718)|
| 1:18:46| They can't get on there right now because of all the recent rains| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=4726)|
| 1:18:49| and there's too much water there in those ponds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=4729)|
| 1:18:53| But when they do get on and can do that remediation that is required of the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=4733)|
| 1:18:59| I'm told by, again, the county that it will take two to three weeks minimum to get that done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=4739)|
| 1:19:05| if there are no mishaps such as a tear in the liner or something like that that they would have to deal with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=4745)|
| 1:19:12| So that's number one as a reason why there ought to be some leeway afforded the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=4752)|
| 1:19:18| at its option to be able to stay and not transfer, if you will,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=4758)|
| 1:19:24| until that additional 30 days is expired.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=4764)|
| 1:19:27| Another reason is I believe when I asked previously,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=4767)|
| 1:19:32| the county law director said once this sale takes place or once the auction is done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=4772)|
| 1:19:38| it would take at least 30 to 45 days to close with the buyer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=4778)|
| 1:19:44| The auction notice, which is by power of auction on this piece of property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=4784)|
| 1:19:49| says that the successful bidder has to give a 45-day notice for the current occupant to vacate the premises| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=4789)|
| 1:19:58| following commission approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=4798)|
| 1:20:01| If you use that 45-day period, you're into the first part of September to get them off that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=4801)|
| 1:20:07| The last point I would make is you have a buyer at an auction if we assume it is somebody other than NRR| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=4807)|
| 1:20:16| and they want to continue the same use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=4816)|
| 1:20:20| they will need some time to get their personnel and equipment in place to take over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=4820)|
| 1:20:25| And I submit to you that contrary to moving into a house on a site such as this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=4825)|
| 1:20:32| we can be moving out at the time they're moving in so you have a more seamless transition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=4832)|
| 1:20:37| and that service continues to be provided to the residents of Knox County to get rid of their green waste.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=4837)|
| 1:20:43| Whereas if you ran up to that August the 31st, we shut down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=4843)|
| 1:20:49| and then thereafter they come in and they start, you're looking at anywhere from 30 to 45,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=4849)|
| 1:20:55| maybe as much as 60 days delay before they can get started and this, that, and the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=4855)|
| 1:21:02| I'm suggesting to you that if you look at it in reality from a business standpoint,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=4862)|
| 1:21:09| these points originated with the county, as far as this matter is concerned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=4869)|
| 1:21:17| originating with the county makes sense for the county to do it that way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=4877)|
| 1:21:22| as opposed to the substitute motion suggestion that come August the 31st you're gone one way or the other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=4882)|
| 1:21:30| because what that's going to do is force them in that last 30 days of that time period| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=4890)|
| 1:21:37| not to be providing the service but to be getting off the property if they're not the winner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=4897)|
| 1:21:44| Now, the other thing is if you consider that you go to auction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=4904)|
| 1:21:49| and this property is bought by someone who doesn't intend to use it in its current fashion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=4909)|
| 1:21:56| then you may not need that 30 days extra.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=4916)|
| 1:21:59| You can say, okay, they're not going to use it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=4919)|
| 1:22:03| That buyer wants them off as soon as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=4923)|
| 1:22:07| Then the county doesn't exercise that option to extend and they get off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=4927)|
| 1:22:12| I suggest to you that the motion that was originally made gives the county much more flexibility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=4932)|
| 1:22:18| in how to deal with this property and the various what ifs than it is to tie you to that August 31,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=4938)|
| 1:22:27| i.e., the 31-day contract by virtue of the substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=4947)|
| 1:22:33| Mr. Keene.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=4953)|
| 1:22:34| That was my point in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=4954)|
| 1:22:37| I don't want to have to see the county spend any more money cleaning this up supposing R doesn't get it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=4957)|
| 1:22:44| I don't want to have to see the county go out there and spend thousands of dollars cleaning it up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=4964)|
| 1:22:48| for John Doe who buys it and wants to put in a goat farm, for instance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=4968)|
| 1:22:51| I mean, I'm just pulling that out of my hat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=4971)|
| 1:22:54| But, you know, this seems to me the best way for us to get out of this situation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=4974)|
| 1:23:01| with the least of the minimal amount of expense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=4981)|
| 1:23:04| And I think that's what we need to do at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=4984)|
| 1:23:06| I'm not happy with some things that have gone on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=4986)|
| 1:23:08| but I still feel like that this is the best solution to get out of it in the most economical way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=4988)|
| 1:23:16| Well, and I don't disagree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=4996)|
| 1:23:20| You know, for so long as you have a current contractor in place on a monthly basis, he is paying money to the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=5000)|
| 1:23:28| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=5008)|
| 1:23:29| And, for example, this past Saturday, there were at Forks of the River and at Solway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=5009)|
| 1:23:36| there were 500 transactions that day alone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=5016)|
| 1:23:39| So it's in heavy utilization right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=5019)|
| 1:23:43| We've got a substitute motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=5023)|
| 1:23:44| Larry, do you want to speak to the substitute?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=5024)|
| 1:23:46| Quick question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=5026)|
| 1:23:47| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=5027)|
| 1:23:48| Can you answer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=5028)|
| 1:23:49| John, don't go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=5029)|
| 1:23:50| I may have a question for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=5030)|
| 1:23:53| I'm listening to what Dr. Briggs came up with in resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=5033)|
| 1:23:56| And I like that resolution, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=5036)|
| 1:23:58| But according to what John is telling us here, that you're going to need this other time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=5038)|
| 1:24:04| Is it in our contract that if they do not have that spick and span, if they leave us stuff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=5044)|
| 1:24:12| they're going to pay us something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=5052)|
| 1:24:13| What guarantee do we have for the citizens?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=5053)|
| 1:24:15| You know, these people may get the contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=5055)|
| 1:24:17| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=5057)|
| 1:24:18| They may buy it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=5058)|
| 1:24:19| For some reason, they don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=5059)|
| 1:24:20| What guarantee do we have for the citizens that they're not going to be paying the hall bill| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=5060)|
| 1:24:25| to get that stuff out of there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=5065)|
| 1:24:28| That is a part of the agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=5068)|
| 1:24:30| That would be at the expense of that contractor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=5070)|
| 1:24:33| Of course, we would have to pursue that issue with the law director's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=5073)|
| 1:24:39| That's my concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=5079)|
| 1:24:43| Brad, you got a question or a comment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=5083)|
| 1:24:48| If another mulch business buys this property, in natural resources recovery of Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=5088)|
| 1:24:55| who it's my understanding in the past at one point filed some paperwork to dissolve the Tennessee Corporation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=5095)|
| 1:25:02| And I think they reversed that and backed out of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=5102)|
| 1:25:05| But if another mulch business was to buy this property, in natural resources recovery of Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=5105)|
| 1:25:11| was to disappear, who would we go after if they didn't exist anymore?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=5111)|
| 1:25:17| If they dissolved, if they bankrupted, who are we going to go after to clean up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=5117)|
| 1:25:21| They're telling you about this, what a great service,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=5121)|
| 1:25:24| because we've got thousands of tons of green waste coming on to your property that you're trying to sell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=5124)|
| 1:25:29| But if they leave town and they haven't processed that material,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=5129)|
| 1:25:32| it can cost you what the property is worth to clean it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=5132)|
| 1:25:36| And if another mulch business moves in, they're not going to spend $25 a ton| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=5136)|
| 1:25:43| to grind all that material up out of their pocket.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=5143)|
| 1:25:46| And then let's say that someone other than a mulch business buys it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=5146)|
| 1:25:50| like the gentleman that's back here from the salvage yard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=5150)|
| 1:25:53| We don't have an operational bond or performance bond from these people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=5153)|
| 1:25:57| They're in custody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=5157)|
| 1:25:58| We spent $4.9 million building this site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=5158)|
| 1:26:02| They're in custody of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=5162)|
| 1:26:03| There's no performance bond that I'm aware of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=5163)|
| 1:26:05| And if there is, it's probably a penance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=5165)|
| 1:26:07| It's probably $100,000, which is a drop in the bucket when it comes to cleaning this up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=5167)|
| 1:26:12| That's where your exposure is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=5172)|
| 1:26:14| You're taking a great gamble to make an extra $6,000 of rent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=5174)|
| 1:26:21| $6,000 worth of rent versus gambling that a Tennessee LLC that can file bankruptcy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=5181)|
| 1:26:26| and leave the state tomorrow might leave your property full of all this storm debris.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=5186)|
| 1:26:30| There's other companies that you can divert this storm waste to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=5190)|
| 1:26:34| One's in deep west Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=5194)|
| 1:26:35| The other one's in downtown Knoxville right here off of Aylor Avenue where people can drop it off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=5195)|
| 1:26:40| You don't have the exposure of potentially having to dispose of all this material.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=5200)|
| 1:26:44| And I think that 30-day extension, could you imagine in 30 days extension time how much material| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=5204)|
| 1:26:51| with what's going on can land on your concrete for you to clean up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=5211)|
| 1:26:55| Mr. King, what kind of, what's our safeguard?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=5215)|
| 1:27:01| Whatever the risk is for going forward with this contract| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=5221)|
| 1:27:06| and the 30-day extension is the same risk you've got right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=5226)|
| 1:27:10| I mean, theoretically they could walk off tomorrow and you've got the same risk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=5230)|
| 1:27:16| I don't mean to be argumentative, but that's just the facts of the matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=5236)|
| 1:27:20| That's the situation you've got.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=5240)|
| 1:27:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=5242)|
| 1:27:23| We're getting into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=5243)|
| 1:27:25| Mr. King, Mr. Mays, we're not going to sit up here and battle back and forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=5245)|
| 1:27:29| We've heard both sides, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=5249)|
| 1:27:32| I would just observe on the idea about going off and leaving product on site if, in fact,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=5252)|
| 1:27:39| some other provider of the same service that is being provided now is the purchaser,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=5259)|
| 1:27:45| whether it's us or somebody else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=5265)|
| 1:27:48| That product on site is of benefit to them in their operation, not necessarily a detriment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=5268)|
| 1:27:55| I don't, you know, as I say, I don't want to get in a big argument about all of those operations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=5275)|
| 1:28:01| and operational issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=5281)|
| 1:28:02| What I wanted to speak to predominantly was the points I made before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=5282)|
| 1:28:06| I think it is far wiser for the county to be in a position where it has that alternative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=5286)|
| 1:28:12| for that additional 30-day period given whatever the circumstances are at the end of August.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=5292)|
| 1:28:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=5300)|
| 1:28:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=5301)|
| 1:28:22| Mr. Christianburg.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=5302)|
| 1:28:23| That was really the point I was going to make is that we could get stuck at the end of July| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=5303)|
| 1:28:29| or we could get stuck at the end of August, either way with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=5309)|
| 1:28:34| You know, I think that as far as the county is concerned, we actually have more flexibility if we do the 31.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=5314)|
| 1:28:40| There's nothing to say that if it's in the county's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=5320)|
| 1:28:42| and the taxpayer's interest that we can't give them a second extension if we need to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=5322)|
| 1:28:47| I know that puts it on a short time frame.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=5327)|
| 1:28:52| You know, I guess one of the things about the green waste that I don't understand is that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=5332)|
| 1:28:56| when NRR moved on there, one of their main arguments that they used as to why Knox County didn't live up to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=5336)|
| 1:29:03| contract was because there wasn't green waste there for them to, you know, to grind when they got there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=5343)|
| 1:29:09| And that's part of the reason we had to make, you know, to make one of the settlements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=5349)|
| 1:29:15| I still think that, you know, that the 30-day notice is 31-day notice is plenty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=5355)|
| 1:29:22| And if we needed to give them another extension, we can give them another extension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=5362)|
| 1:29:26| If there's material there and there's a new person coming on that hasn't got there yet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=5366)|
| 1:29:32| then rather than Knox County contracting with it, then they can contract with NRR.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=5372)|
| 1:29:36| They'd probably be glad to sit there and grind and make more money while the new person's moving in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=5376)|
| 1:29:42| But I'd still stick with the 31, you know, the 31-day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=5382)|
| 1:29:46| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=5386)|
| 1:29:47| We've got a substitute motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=5387)|
| 1:29:48| The substitute motion is to do August 31st, the contract extension to August 31st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=5388)|
| 1:29:54| Everybody ready to vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=5394)|
| 1:29:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=5396)|
| 1:29:57| We're going to make a roll call vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=5397)|
| 1:30:03| Commissioner Norman, I'm going to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=5403)|
| 1:30:06| Norman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=5406)|
| 1:30:07| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=5407)|
| 1:30:08| Commissioner Norman votes yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=5408)|
| 1:30:09| Commissioner Ornby?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=5409)|
| 1:30:10| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=5410)|
| 1:30:11| Commissioner Ornby votes yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=5411)|
| 1:30:12| Commissioner Briggs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=5412)|
| 1:30:13| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=5413)|
| 1:30:14| Commissioner Briggs votes yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=5414)|
| 1:30:15| Commissioner Anders?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=5415)|
| 1:30:16| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=5416)|
| 1:30:17| Commissioner Anders votes no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=5417)|
| 1:30:18| Commissioner Smith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=5418)|
| 1:30:19| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=5419)|
| 1:30:20| Commissioner Smith votes no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=5420)|
| 1:30:21| Commissioner Wright?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=5421)|
| 1:30:22| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=5422)|
| 1:30:23| Commissioner Wright votes yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=5423)|
| 1:30:24| Commissioner Brown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=5424)|
| 1:30:25| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=5425)|
| 1:30:26| Commissioner Brown votes no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=5426)|
| 1:30:28| Commissioner Shouse?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=5428)|
| 1:30:29| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=5429)|
| 1:30:30| Commissioner Shouse votes yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=5430)|
| 1:30:36| There are five ayes, three noes, and fails with lack of six votes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=5436)|
| 1:30:42| The original motion is to do a 30-day up to 60-day extension of the contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=5442)|
| 1:30:50| Resolution as written.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=5450)|
| 1:30:53| Yes, sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=5453)|
| 1:30:54| This is a point I'd like to ask the law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=5454)|
| 1:30:57| We may end up with the same vote this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=5457)|
| 1:31:01| May very well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=5461)|
| 1:31:02| And that would be nothing happens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=5462)|
| 1:31:04| They have to be gone by July 31st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=5464)|
| 1:31:07| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=5467)|
| 1:31:08| July 31st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=5468)|
| 1:31:10| The caveat I was going to introduce was that once the auction, when is the auction?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=5470)|
| 1:31:15| 13th of July.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=5475)|
| 1:31:16| July 13th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=5476)|
| 1:31:17| There's nothing to stop us from having a, once Hugh Holt reviews the buyer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=5477)|
| 1:31:23| there's nothing to stop us if need be to have a special called commission meeting to approve that sale to expedite this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=5483)|
| 1:31:29| And so there's nothing to say that we can't expedite it without having a commission meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=5489)|
| 1:31:35| I tell you, I think the point I was trying to make on this is that part of the problem is we're short three people today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=5495)|
| 1:31:42| You know, which makes getting, it's going to be tough on anything that's controversial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=5502)|
| 1:31:48| And it puts the, I think this puts the county in a real bad spot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=5508)|
| 1:31:52| It puts the present vendor in a real bad spot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=5512)|
| 1:31:56| And it puts the person that buys the property, no matter who it is, in a bad spot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=5516)|
| 1:32:05| I don't have a good solution to this, you know, because of the situation we're in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=5525)|
| 1:32:10| I mean, we may vote on everything today and not hit six votes because those three are being counted as nos.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=5530)|
| 1:32:18| And, you know, I don't know if we can do this or not, but could we, you know, could we,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=5538)|
| 1:32:25| I want to re-vote on the one that we're having.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=5545)|
| 1:32:27| I mean, I'll play by the rules because this happened with the rules that we're under.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=5547)|
| 1:32:31| But do we need to or are we able to suspend our rules so that a majority of votes today would allow us to do business?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=5551)|
| 1:32:41| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=5561)|
| 1:32:42| The charter reads that a quorum is established by the commission as a whole, not those commissions present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=5562)|
| 1:32:49| So you'll need six votes to conduct business and maintain a quorum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=5569)|
| 1:32:53| Hugh Holt, could you come down, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=5573)|
| 1:32:56| Are you done, Commissioner Briggs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=5576)|
| 1:32:57| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=5577)|
| 1:32:58| Yeah, that's all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=5578)|
| 1:32:59| It was just a sequel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=5579)|
| 1:33:01| Explain the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=5581)|
| 1:33:02| Once we do the auction on the 13th and you've established a buyer, how long does your office need before?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=5582)|
| 1:33:09| When will you present it to us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=5589)|
| 1:33:10| If you didn't have a commission agenda to meet, when would you be able to present us with that to approve?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=5590)|
| 1:33:17| Within 48 hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=5597)|
| 1:33:19| And then that would begin the 45 days if NRR is not the, that would begin the 45 days?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=5599)|
| 1:33:26| We stipulated at the approval by commission, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=5606)|
| 1:33:34| Commissioner Smith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=5614)|
| 1:33:36| Brad, one last comment and then I've got something to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=5616)|
| 1:33:41| Well, I just thought of something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=5621)|
| 1:33:42| We have two people here tonight that's interested in buying the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=5622)|
| 1:33:47| And I think what happens here could affect what they bid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=5627)|
| 1:33:50| Would they prefer they have an extension or would they prefer that the contractor be gone by the end of July?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=5630)|
| 1:33:55| Because that can affect your bottom line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=5635)|
| 1:33:57| And there's two vendors sitting right here that's trying to bid and buy the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=5637)|
| 1:34:01| In addition to that, the 30-day extension, I've been around this business my whole life| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=5641)|
| 1:34:07| and what I understand that to be is they want permission to take 30 more days of green waste.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=5647)|
| 1:34:13| And that's 30 more days of green waste you could potentially have to clean up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=5653)|
| 1:34:17| That is not an asset.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=5657)|
| 1:34:19| It costs $25 a ton to grind this material the first time just to make it into coarse mulch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=5659)|
| 1:34:25| Then you have to spend another $6 or $8 a ton to make a finished product before you can sell it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=5665)|
| 1:34:30| It is a liability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=5670)|
| 1:34:32| It can cost you hundreds of thousands of dollars to clean up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=5672)|
| 1:34:35| This extra 30 days of green waste can cost you a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=5675)|
| 1:34:39| There's two other vendors here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=5679)|
| 1:34:41| They may want them gone and that may affect what their bid is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=5681)|
| 1:34:44| Because if they need that material gone and they would feel more comfortable with 30 days less green waste coming in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=5684)|
| 1:34:50| before they have to assume liability for the site, that can affect their bottom line| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=5690)|
| 1:34:55| and their bidding potential quite a bit, this 30-day extension or 60.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=5695)|
| 1:35:00| Mr. Chairman, and I'll say this to the administration too, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=5700)|
| 1:35:03| this is an important vote, what we're fixing to do right here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=5703)|
| 1:35:07| But it all goes back to what Dr. Briggs says and Ed Schaus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=5707)|
| 1:35:11| You know, we represent the people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=5711)|
| 1:35:13| And we've had unusual, unusual storm damage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=5713)|
| 1:35:16| That's what I spent all weekend doing was hauling limbs and trees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=5716)|
| 1:35:20| I've got a 12-foot diameter tree cut down at my place of business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=5720)|
| 1:35:24| I don't know where I'm going to mulch that up at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=5724)|
| 1:35:27| Diameter?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=5727)|
| 1:35:28| Diameter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=5728)|
| 1:35:29| It's in the cypress dust.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=5729)|
| 1:35:33| And I'm going to vote for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=5733)|
| 1:35:35| And the reason being is because it's, you know, our backs are against the wall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=5735)|
| 1:35:39| But, you know, Dwight and you guys, we're depending on, you know, make us proud when it's all said and done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=5739)|
| 1:35:46| Let's get it, you know, if he's not the person, then let's get it cleaned up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=5746)|
| 1:35:50| Because a lot of people are watching.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=5750)|
| 1:35:52| But I'm going to be voting for this because I think at this point and this point in time, it's the right thing to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=5752)|
| 1:35:58| No, do I want to give them any more money?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=5758)|
| 1:35:59| No, I don't want to give them any more money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=5759)|
| 1:36:01| But it's what the storms we've had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=5761)|
| 1:36:03| We need to clean this place up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=5763)|
| 1:36:06| One last comment, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=5766)|
| 1:36:08| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=5768)|
| 1:36:10| If the sale goes down the 13th and Hughes just told us he can have the paperwork ready in 48 hours,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=5770)|
| 1:36:16| if we have a special meeting, 45 days puts this at the end of August anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=5776)|
| 1:36:21| So we're talking about a 30-day?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=5781)|
| 1:36:23| I mean, that's probably the 90 percentile scenario in this case is a 30-day extension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=5783)|
| 1:36:30| What I'm going to ask is that Commissioner Chairman Hammond, when he comes and returns,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=5790)|
| 1:36:35| is to put this as a special called meeting before the work session next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=5795)|
| 1:36:40| We can go ahead and vote on it before the work session starts and then go on with our work session agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=5800)|
| 1:36:45| And that will speed up the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=5805)|
| 1:36:49| We're still talking roughly the end of August.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=5809)|
| 1:36:52| It still speeds the process and it gets it clean.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=5812)|
| 1:36:54| So we're going to vote on the original motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=5814)|
| 1:36:58| You may accept your amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=5818)|
| 1:37:04| We're going to have a hot dog cookout.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=5824)|
| 1:37:06| The clerks are saying that mine would be an amendment or a caveat to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=5826)|
| 1:37:12| So I'm going to make an amendment to the, who made the motion, original motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=5832)|
| 1:37:18| Commissioner Wright and Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=5838)|
| 1:37:19| We all accept that, that we'll have a special called before the work session to vote on it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=5839)|
| 1:37:23| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=5843)|
| 1:37:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=5844)|
| 1:37:25| That's what we're voting on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=5845)|
| 1:37:27| So if I want to just make sure that I understand and everybody understands,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=5847)|
| 1:37:33| without a positive vote on this motion, there is not even that 30-day contract,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=5853)|
| 1:37:40| which means that this facility, in essence, would be put in the posture of shutting it down like right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=5860)|
| 1:37:49| in order to be off the site by the end of July.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=5869)|
| 1:37:52| So I think I just wanted to make that point, and I would urge you to vote in favor of the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=5872)|
| 1:38:01| Dwight, do you have a statement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=5881)|
| 1:38:03| Mr. Chairman, I just wanted to speak briefly to a couple of things that Mr. King mentioned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=5883)|
| 1:38:09| The option to renew, we requested that, and that is our option, not natural resources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=5889)|
| 1:38:15| And it's primarily driven by our need to make sure that sediment ponds one and two are cleaned out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=5895)|
| 1:38:20| TDEC has advised us that is our material.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=5900)|
| 1:38:23| We're responsible for it even after the property conveys to the new owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=5903)|
| 1:38:27| So it's our intent to have it off-site, properly landfilled, and disposed of so that when this property does change hands,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=5907)|
| 1:38:36| Knox County has no subsequent liabilities or responsibilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=5916)|
| 1:38:40| We'll be out of the mulch business once and for all, and maybe we can put this discussion to rest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=5920)|
| 1:38:45| Do you have a problem with us approving it at the work session, the seller at the work session, and beginning the process?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=5925)|
| 1:38:51| No, sir, but we would like to have the option to renew.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=5931)|
| 1:38:53| I'd have to think through the timelines a little bit, but the weather has held us up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=5933)|
| 1:38:58| We do have the contractors in place to do the sediment removal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=5938)|
| 1:39:02| We do have the contractor in place to do the liner repair because we will damage the liner getting in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=5942)|
| 1:39:07| and out to get the sediment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=5947)|
| 1:39:09| We have all the pieces in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=5949)|
| 1:39:10| What we haven't had is cooperative weather because we have to have the ponds absolutely dry in order to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=5950)|
| 1:39:15| So that's why we've asked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=5955)|
| 1:39:19| So my amendment may or my caveat may hamper the reclamation of the ponds?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=5959)|
| 1:39:26| Potentially.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=5966)|
| 1:39:27| I'd like to think not good weather would be something we'd really hope for, but it's just not something we've had so far.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=5967)|
| 1:39:34| Again, this is our option to renew.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=5974)|
| 1:39:36| If we're dispensed with our work at the ponds, then we would not exercise that renewal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=5976)|
| 1:39:41| We would simply end this arrangement and let the property convey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=5981)|
| 1:39:46| It just gives us a little bit of flexibility in the event that something goes south on us as far as getting the ponds cleaned out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=5986)|
| 1:39:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=5992)|
| 1:39:53| I'm going to pull my caveat away because I don't want to set that back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=5993)|
| 1:39:57| Sir, would you like to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=5997)|
| 1:39:58| I need your name and address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=5998)|
| 1:40:00| Ken Frazier, 7700 Gleason Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=6000)|
| 1:40:05| Let me just see if I have this straight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=6005)|
| 1:40:06| If we go ahead and have the auction on the 13th, are you guys wanting the option to delay the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=6006)|
| 1:40:14| if it in fact is a new owner, to delay the time, basically delay the date that that guy can move in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=6014)|
| 1:40:24| Why would that have any?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=6024)|
| 1:40:25| You've got to close with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=6025)|
| 1:40:26| If you do 60 days, there's no way that you'd be able to change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=6026)|
| 1:40:31| The property couldn't change hands properly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=6031)|
| 1:40:34| And if you extend the contract 60 days, it just can't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=6034)|
| 1:40:40| I think, and I don't want to put words in your mouth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=6040)|
| 1:40:43| I think that you're saying is that according to the present contract and the announcement from the auction company,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=6043)|
| 1:40:50| is that you would be able to take possession within 45 days of when the county votes on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=6050)|
| 1:40:56| Let me pick an easy one to work with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=6056)|
| 1:40:58| I'm going to be off a day or two, but let's say we voted on it on July 15th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=6058)|
| 1:41:02| He should be able to take, according to the conditions that he's buying the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=6062)|
| 1:41:07| he should be able to take possession at or about August 31st or September 1st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=6067)|
| 1:41:14| But if we give a 60-day extension, he wouldn't be able to take possession until October 1st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=6074)|
| 1:41:24| Is that what you're asking?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=6084)|
| 1:41:25| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=6085)|
| 1:41:26| He wants to know what's going to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=6086)|
| 1:41:30| Do we follow the conditions of the contract or do we, the contract that he's made to buy the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=6090)|
| 1:41:37| or do we follow the conditions of the resolution that we're about to pass?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=6097)|
| 1:41:41| Well, the resolution is for 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=6101)|
| 1:41:43| No, we failed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=6103)|
| 1:41:44| That's failed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=6104)|
| 1:41:45| Thirty to 60.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=6105)|
| 1:41:46| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=6106)|
| 1:41:47| No more than 60.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=6107)|
| 1:41:48| But it doesn't say it will be 60.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=6108)|
| 1:41:49| It can be less than 30.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=6109)|
| 1:41:52| We're essentially approving a 30-day one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=6112)|
| 1:41:55| But if Black comes back and says, okay, we need another two weeks, three weeks, whatever, we can go up to 60.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=6115)|
| 1:42:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=6121)|
| 1:42:02| Yeah, just so I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=6122)|
| 1:42:03| Well, the trouble is if we go up to 60, then is there a conflict?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=6123)|
| 1:42:08| Are we into the new ownership?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=6128)|
| 1:42:09| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=6129)|
| 1:42:10| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=6130)|
| 1:42:11| If it's sold on the 13th and somebody else buys it, on the 13th it's going to be sold, auctioned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=6131)|
| 1:42:18| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=6138)|
| 1:42:19| If it's sold that day to somebody else other than NRR, I think NRR is going to get the message| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=6139)|
| 1:42:24| and realize that we're going to have to start work on the 14th and clean this up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=6144)|
| 1:42:29| Well, you can say that, but we've been through this before in 2003 where a contract said one thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=6149)|
| 1:42:36| and then somebody else had a different interpretation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=6156)|
| 1:42:39| And it cost the county a half a million dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=6159)|
| 1:42:42| Well, I'm assuming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=6162)|
| 1:42:43| I think that what we need to do, there needs to be some consistencies and not depend upon what somebody else said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=6163)|
| 1:42:48| and this or that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=6168)|
| 1:42:49| I mean, we have to have a consistency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=6169)|
| 1:42:51| If the agreement to sell the property says the owner will take possession 45 days after approval by the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=6171)|
| 1:42:58| commission, do we do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=6178)|
| 1:43:00| Or do we give up to 60 days, which would take it, you know, almost a month later?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=6180)|
| 1:43:06| Well, I don't see that as conflicting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=6186)|
| 1:43:07| I see that as terms and conditions of sale, which is going to override whatever we decide we need to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=6187)|
| 1:43:17| and extension to go with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=6197)|
| 1:43:19| I think Hugh would answer the question the best.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=6199)|
| 1:43:22| I mean, he's going to be the one exercising all the.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=6202)|
| 1:43:26| Just a minute, Mr. King.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=6206)|
| 1:43:27| I'll get Hugh Holt down here to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=6207)|
| 1:43:30| That would shorten the time frame by about seven days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=6210)|
| 1:43:34| and that's something that we would have to communicate to the potential bidders in this process as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=6214)|
| 1:43:41| So if you did a 60-day extension, they would potentially lose a week?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=6221)|
| 1:43:45| Is that what you're saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=6225)|
| 1:43:46| Or would you shorten the approval date to, what were you thinking, the 15th?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=6226)|
| 1:43:51| Well, I mean, I was thinking the work session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=6231)|
| 1:43:53| Well, 48 hours would be the 15th, roughly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=6233)|
| 1:43:56| But what we're concerned about, if you have an up to a 60-day, it's 45 days once the approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=6236)|
| 1:44:03| The owner can take over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=6243)|
| 1:44:04| You're asking for a 60-day extension from July the 31st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=6244)|
| 1:44:08| That's a month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=6248)|
| 1:44:10| I mean, that's a month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=6250)|
| 1:44:11| That's a month difference, not a week's difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=6251)|
| 1:44:13| So the new owner could not move in until October the 1st, is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=6253)|
| 1:44:17| Yes, we would have to extend that, you're correct, and communicate that to the bidders as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=6257)|
| 1:44:24| But it's only a possible 60, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=6264)|
| 1:44:26| Yes, it's, yeah, a minimum of 30, maximum of 60.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=6266)|
| 1:44:30| Would we pass on the rent to that potential owner that NRT pays the county?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=6270)|
| 1:44:34| Well, and there's nothing that says that the successful bidder couldn't come in and collect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=6274)|
| 1:44:40| They just couldn't process, as Commissioner Briggs has alluded to, that I'm sure NRR, well, I'm not sure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=6280)|
| 1:44:49| but they could stay there and grind them, grind the waste for them as a subcontractor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=6289)|
| 1:44:56| You know, I guess my question is, is if they take possession and they own the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=6296)|
| 1:45:01| they own it on September the 1st, what validity does anything that we have with NRR,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=6301)|
| 1:45:07| I mean, the NRR is just on property we own.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=6307)|
| 1:45:09| If we don't own the property, then if the buyer says, I want them, I mean, they have to be gone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=6309)|
| 1:45:17| Because there shouldn't be, I mean, there's no contract between the buyer and NRR.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=6317)|
| 1:45:22| There's a term there, though, tenant in possession, so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=6322)|
| 1:45:27| But we're the contractee, we're the, so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=6327)|
| 1:45:31| Mr. King, do you have something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=6331)|
| 1:45:34| If I understand where the commission is now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=6334)|
| 1:45:38| We're on the original motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=6338)|
| 1:45:39| We're on the original motion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=6339)|
| 1:45:41| and Chairman Anders has withdrawn his suggestion about bringing it back as an item to be dealt with at the work session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=6341)|
| 1:45:50| So essentially what you've got is the auction is going to take place on the 13th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=6350)|
| 1:45:57| It's going to be in front of this body on the 25th of June.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=6357)|
| 1:46:02| Unless there's a special session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=6362)|
| 1:46:04| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=6364)|
| 1:46:05| You know, absent something else occurring, that's when it's going to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=6365)|
| 1:46:10| And I would respectfully submit that the period of time of delay to whoever that ultimate purchaser is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=6370)|
| 1:46:19| is not going to drive away, if you will, the interest in bidding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=6379)|
| 1:46:26| If you're talking about a matter of roughly anywhere from, say, two weeks to 15 days difference or something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=6386)|
| 1:46:33| And I think we may lose sight of the object by trying to finitely detail, if you will, the terms of the sale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=6393)|
| 1:46:47| Certainly all announcements made at the time prior to the auction, but at the time of the auction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=6407)|
| 1:46:55| will be what's going to be controlling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=6415)|
| 1:46:57| So, you know, we can, if that auction occurs and they want to say at the outside,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=6417)|
| 1:47:06| at the outside you're going to be entitled to possession on a certain date, that can be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=6426)|
| 1:47:13| I think that the way it is right now that the best thing to do is, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=6433)|
| 1:47:21| not try to finitely detail all these various dates and go with a 30-day contract with the potential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=6441)|
| 1:47:29| at the county's sole option for an additional period not to exceed a 30-day time period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=6449)|
| 1:47:37| And I think everybody can live within the confines of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=6457)|
| 1:47:40| And that's sort of what's out there in the general public now as to what's going to occur, how this is going to proceed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=6460)|
| 1:47:51| Not the least of the interest involved is the interest on the part of the citizenry| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=6471)|
| 1:47:58| and particularly those members of the public that are engaged in this business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=6478)|
| 1:48:02| and having some, if you will, degree of definiteness as to when and where their, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=6482)|
| 1:48:12| their opportunity to put product there is going to either continue or end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=6492)|
| 1:48:19| We get innumerable calls every day asking about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=6499)|
| 1:48:25| And the auctioneer has said a lot of the calls that come to him are coming to people who are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=6505)|
| 1:48:30| the people who have got all this green waste and stuff trying to make sure what the situation is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=6510)|
| 1:48:36| and where they're going to be taking their product and that sort of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=6516)|
| 1:48:39| So the more definite we can be without getting it convoluted, I would submit that's also the better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=6519)|
| 1:48:47| Commissioner Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=6527)|
| 1:48:50| Original motion is before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=6530)|
| 1:48:54| To approve resolution as it is, 30 days up to 60 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=6534)|
| 1:48:58| I'll make a roll call vote, starting in the third.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=6538)|

| 1:49:40| 6-1-1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=6580)|
| 1:49:41| The measure passes 30 to 60 days extension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=6581)|
| 1:49:47| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=6587)|
| 1:49:48| The next item is resolution 904.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=6588)|
| 1:49:50| It's approving an amendment to Knox County contract number 02-234 as amended with the Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=6590)|
| 1:49:57| Tourism and Sports Corporation to extend the contract term through June 30, 2006, 2016.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=6597)|
| 1:50:05| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=6605)|
| 1:50:06| I hear a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=6606)|
| 1:50:07| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=6607)|
| 1:50:08| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=6608)|
| 1:50:09| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=6609)|
| 1:50:10| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=6610)|
| 1:50:13| Resolution 906.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=6613)|
| 1:50:15| Approving a two-year grant agreement in the amount of $850,000 or $425,000 per year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=6615)|
| 1:50:24| No local match required with the Tennessee Office of Criminal Justice Program, OCJP, for the Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=6624)|
| 1:50:31| Drug Courts Residential Treatment Program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=6631)|
| 1:50:34| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=6634)|
| 1:50:35| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=6635)|
| 1:50:37| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=6637)|
| 1:50:39| Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=6639)|
| 1:50:40| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=6640)|
| 1:50:42| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=6642)|
| 1:50:43| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=6643)|
| 1:50:44| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=6644)|
| 1:50:46| Resolution 907 is adopting a victim's assistant assessment and designating the Knoxville Family| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=6646)|
| 1:50:52| Justice Center to receive the funds generated by the assessment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=6652)|
| 1:50:57| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=6657)|
| 1:50:59| Joy, do you have anything?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=6659)|
| 1:51:05| Do you have any comment or anything on it, Joy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=6665)|
| 1:51:09| I just wanted you to be aware that this passed in 2006.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=6669)|
| 1:51:15| The commission introduced a resolution and passed it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=6675)|
| 1:51:20| But it was not as we were not left out because we were a charter county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=6680)|
| 1:51:26| It was because of the fee bills involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=6686)|
| 1:51:30| The rest of the state is under one fee bill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=6690)|
| 1:51:34| Knox County is under an entirely different fee bill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=6694)|
| 1:51:38| And this law that was passed, the Crime Victim Assistance Fund was passed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=6698)|
| 1:51:46| and that money could only be collected under the flat fee bill, as all the clerks call it, flat fees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=6706)|
| 1:51:55| instead of itemized fees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=6715)|
| 1:51:58| That's the reason Knox County could not collect that $45 fee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=6718)|
| 1:52:03| This is remedies, is this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=6723)|
| 1:52:04| It's remedies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=6724)|
| 1:52:05| I went to Representative Ryan Haynes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=6725)|
| 1:52:07| He was able to attach it to a bill this year, got that passed, and that's why it's before you today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=6727)|
| 1:52:15| If I could, Ms. McCroskey and I were trading phone calls last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=6735)|
| 1:52:19| The essence of the resolution, however, the end result is what you're trying to achieve, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=6739)|
| 1:52:25| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=6745)|
| 1:52:26| It's just that one portion that is incorrect in terms of it reading that it didn't apply to charter counties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=6746)|
| 1:52:32| No, I don't think it has anything to do with charter counties because Shelby County collects it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=6752)|
| 1:52:37| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=6757)|
| 1:52:38| They are under this flat fee bill, which I would love to be under that section of the law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=6758)|
| 1:52:44| And I'm going to try to do that in the January session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=6764)|
| 1:52:50| What I'm getting at is we can clean up that part of the language.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=6770)|
| 1:52:52| We are cleaning up this bill for victims' assistance that goes to the Family Justice Center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=6772)|
| 1:52:58| by adding the 821-409 section of the code, which is the fees we collect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=6778)|
| 1:53:07| By putting it under that code section, I can collect this $45.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=6787)|
| 1:53:12| As soon as the mayor signs it, you're going to be, he'll send you a letter and you'll be collecting it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=6792)|
| 1:53:17| We can tweak that portion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=6797)|
| 1:53:18| But the end result, that the relief you're seeking in the resolution is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=6798)|
| 1:53:22| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=6802)|
| 1:53:23| Got a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=6803)|
| 1:53:24| All in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=6804)|
| 1:53:25| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=6805)|
| 1:53:26| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=6806)|
| 1:53:27| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=6807)|
| 1:53:30| Are we going to ordinances?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=6810)|
| 1:53:38| Before we go to ordinances, I want to give Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=6818)|
| 1:53:42| We have some public forum that did not show up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=6822)|
| 1:53:44| And if it's okay with commission that Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=6824)|

| 1:54:16| This is amending section 2-274 of the Knox County Code, Chapter 2, Article 3,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=6856)|

| 1:54:33| ascribed to the Knox County Auditor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=6873)|
| 1:54:36| Ordinance 0-02-8-105 adopted September 23rd, 2002.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=6876)|

| 1:54:46| Commissioner Wright, do you have a discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=6886)|
| 1:54:49| Commissioner Schaust, Commissioner Broyles and I are on the audit committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=6889)|
| 1:54:54| And this is a change that's allowable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=6894)|
| 1:55:01| And I'd like to ask the law director if he would, just a moment, explain why it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=6901)|
| 1:55:06| Not that we're changing anything as far as how we actually do something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=6906)|
| 1:55:09| It just offers an option, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=6909)|
| 1:55:12| Yes, well stated, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=6912)|
| 1:55:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=6913)|
| 1:55:14| Essentially, your code reads at this juncture that any audits are to be conducted by the Office of Internal Audit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=6914)|
| 1:55:21| This gives you the option to explore whether or not you want to defer some of those duties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=6921)|
| 1:55:26| and responsibilities to outsource it, essentially, to outside auditing firms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=6926)|
| 1:55:31| But it doesn't compel you to do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=6931)|
| 1:55:34| It merely gives you the option that you would do during a public meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=6934)|
| 1:55:38| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=6938)|

| 1:57:37| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=7057)|
| 1:57:40| We're going to discussion items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=7060)|
| 1:57:41| Mr. Smith on redistricting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=7061)|
| 1:57:44| Yeah, I just want to touch base with you on the redistricting and what we met.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=7064)|
| 1:57:49| We met with school board or we met with MPC last week and Rick Emmett and others from MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=7069)|
| 1:58:01| What we'd like to, if anybody, our next meeting is going to be July 21st at the school board over at the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=7081)|
| 1:58:08| boardroom over there so it can be on TV.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=7088)|
| 1:58:10| But if any commissioners have anything that they would need to see changed, anything redistricting in their area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=7090)|
| 1:58:16| we'd like for them to let us know as soon as possible rather than us go through the whole process and come| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=7096)|
| 1:58:20| and try to change it at the end because we'll have to go through the whole process again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=7100)|
| 1:58:24| And the reason that we're trying to do this is because school board races, there's no county commission races up next| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=7104)|
| 1:58:28| year, but school board races, there's a couple of those up and they need to know what districts that they're in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=7108)|
| 1:58:33| Population sizes are this time, now they have increased over 48,025 per district is what's your population per district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=7113)|
| 1:58:45| That's pretty much it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=7125)|
| 1:58:46| Everything is going to be on TV over there and the school is taking notes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=7126)|
| 1:58:51| It's an open meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=7131)|
| 1:58:52| We'll have public forum two or three times throughout the meeting so if anybody has any discussions that they want to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=7132)|
| 1:58:58| But represent you and a couple of Sam McKenzie's on the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=7138)|
| 1:59:02| I think Dr. Briggs is on the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=7142)|
| 1:59:04| If anybody wants to come, it's more than welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=7144)|
| 1:59:07| But the main thing I want to get at is if you have anything that you'd like to see changed in your district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=7147)|
| 1:59:12| take away a precinct, add a precinct, let us know so we can get that as quick as we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=7152)|
| 1:59:17| Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=7157)|
| 1:59:19| Just had an update on hillside stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=7159)|
| 1:59:21| We do have apparently made contact with someone from David Lipscomb at the mediation center to facilitate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=7161)|
| 1:59:30| So I don't know much more than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=7170)|
| 1:59:32| Some of you all may know something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=7172)|
| 1:59:33| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=7173)|
| 1:59:34| Is there a cost associated with that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=7174)|
| 1:59:35| There is some kind of cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=7175)|
| 1:59:37| We haven't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=7177)|
| 1:59:38| And that is a point of discussion also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=7178)|
| 1:59:41| We have an offer to help us with the cost from an outside agency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=7181)|
| 1:59:50| But I would like to investigate us assuming the cost with city council also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=7190)|
| 1:59:57| But I don't have any information about cost right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=7197)|
| 2:00:03| Any more discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=7203)|
| 2:00:04| Anything from the public?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=7204)|

| 2:02:09| And on issues of zoning, I believe, correct me if I'm wrong, Mr. Law Director,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=7329)|
| 2:02:13| but issues of zoning, if it's a no vote, it can't come back for a year, is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=7333)|
| 2:02:21| On zonings?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=7341)|
| 2:02:22| Yes, that's been your policy, correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=7342)|
| 2:02:24| We need to make sure that we're in line there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=7344)|
| 2:02:28| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=7348)|
| 2:02:29| Since there's seven of us here tonight, do we get the other people's checks for not being here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=7349)|
| 2:02:33| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=7353)|
| 2:02:34| Commissioner Owenby.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=7354)|
| 2:02:36| Yes, Chairman, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=7356)|
| 2:02:38| I'd like to request that number three, 5-A-11-RZ, can we move that to the top?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=7358)|
| 2:02:46| Which one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=7366)|
| 2:02:47| The third one down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=7367)|
| 2:02:49| Brian E. Testerman, because I understand that he is not purchasing the property anymore,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=7369)|
| 2:02:56| so he is backed out of the deal, so they don't need the rezoning on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=7376)|
| 2:03:01| The seller wants to leave it as it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=7381)|
| 2:03:04| Is the owner, the current owner of the property here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=7384)|
| 2:03:06| Okay, is Mr. Testerman here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=7386)|
| 2:03:08| Because Mr. Testerman was the applicant, so I don't want to cheat Mr. Testerman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=7388)|
| 2:03:12| Have you got that information, Buzz, from?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=7392)|
| 2:03:18| Mr. Owenby, sorry, no relation that I know of, but we had the same last name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=7398)|
| 2:03:23| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=7403)|
| 2:03:24| I just wanted to move it at the front.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=7404)|
| 2:03:26| State your name and your address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=7406)|
| 2:03:27| My name is Gary Owenby.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=7407)|
| 2:03:29| I live at 214 Tracy Allison in Clinton, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=7409)|
| 2:03:32| But the property is at 1111 Hampson Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=7412)|
| 2:03:35| This particular piece of property is in my mother's estate, which my sister and I are handling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=7415)|
| 2:03:40| Mr. Testerman was going to buy this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=7420)|
| 2:03:43| He has since, as of this morning, he has backed out of this deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=7423)|
| 2:03:47| We do not want, so we're asking that it be withdrawn, the application for rezoning be withdrawn,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=7427)|
| 2:03:53| such that it should be left at its present status in the green belt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=7433)|
| 2:04:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=7440)|
| 2:04:03| Let's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=7443)|
| 2:04:04| Question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=7444)|
| 2:04:05| I have a document that shows where he backed out of the deal, if you'd like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=7445)|
| 2:04:09| And I gave Mr. Owenby a copy of that, and I have some available for you, if you'd like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=7449)|
| 2:04:13| Well, the issue that I have is that he is the applicant on the rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=7453)|
| 2:04:17| And he's paid the money for the rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=7457)|
| 2:04:19| So what I would ask for is a deferment, or the advice for my advice would be to deferment until the end of the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=7459)|
| 2:04:29| If he doesn't show up, then we're going to say we're going to give a 30-day deferment or he just doesn't show up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=7469)|
| 2:04:34| We can give him that opportunity to get with MPC so we're clear, completely clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=7474)|
| 2:04:38| That's my opinion, but.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=7478)|
| 2:04:40| My only, I'm sorry, the only thing, I didn't want them to stay here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=7480)|
| 2:04:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=7485)|
| 2:04:46| So what we need for this, Clark, is we're going to move it to the top of the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=7486)|
| 2:04:49| Let's read it into the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=7489)|
| 2:04:51| And then we'll have that discussion on what we need to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=7491)|
| 2:04:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=7494)|
| 2:04:57| This is item 5-A-11-RZ.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=7497)|
| 2:05:01| It's a request of Ryan E. Testerman for rezoning from RA, low density residential, to PR plan residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=7501)|
| 2:05:07| The property is located southeast side of Nubbin Ridge Road, southwest of Tranquilla Drive in the Fourth Commission District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=7507)|
| 2:05:16| MPC staff, do you have anything or do you want to just wait and see how we handle it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=7516)|
| 2:05:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=7523)|
| 2:05:24| Commissioner Olinby.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=7524)|
| 2:05:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=7528)|
| 2:05:29| If we move this to the end, do they need to be here in order, since they have really nothing to do with this anymore?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=7529)|
| 2:05:36| They're not the applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=7536)|
| 2:05:37| They really have nothing to do with it anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=7537)|
| 2:05:39| So they can leave and we can, let's just.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=7539)|
| 2:05:40| If you put it off 30 days and he sends a letter to MPC, withdraws it, then we're done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=7540)|
| 2:05:47| If you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=7547)|
| 2:05:48| Now, if we move it to the end and he's not here, then it will be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=7548)|
| 2:05:52| It's deferred automatically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=7552)|
| 2:05:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=7553)|
| 2:05:54| May I ask a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=7554)|
| 2:05:55| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=7555)|
| 2:05:56| So he's the applicant, but he's not the owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=7556)|
| 2:06:00| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=7560)|
| 2:06:01| And he's not going to be the owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=7561)|
| 2:06:02| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=7562)|
| 2:06:03| So then he can get a piece of property rezoned without the owner's approval?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=7563)|
| 2:06:08| Well, but he's the applicant and he's paid the money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=7568)|
| 2:06:11| But you didn't answer my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=7571)|
| 2:06:13| My question is, can he get a piece of property rezoned without owning it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=7573)|
| 2:06:18| Regardless of who paid the money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=7578)|
| 2:06:20| At the time of the application, the applicant represented himself as the agent for the owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=7580)|
| 2:06:27| So he was acting on your behalf to rezone the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=7587)|
| 2:06:31| That's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=7591)|
| 2:06:32| Well, in fact, that was not a true statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=7592)|
| 2:06:34| He signed the application in that manner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=7594)|
| 2:06:37| If I have a piece of paper that he has signed requesting his earnest money back,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=7597)|
| 2:06:43| requesting that he does not want this deal anymore, would that satisfy you and you all?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=7603)|
| 2:06:49| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=7609)|
| 2:06:50| I'm just trying to make sure we're legal in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=7610)|
| 2:06:52| If EPC has that and can put that on file.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=7612)|
| 2:06:55| Let me do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=7615)|
| 2:06:56| Let's just defer it for 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=7616)|
| 2:06:58| And that gives Mr. Testament 30 days to withdraw his application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=7618)|
| 2:07:03| Because he's the one that has to withdraw the application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=7623)|
| 2:07:07| He signed it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=7627)|
| 2:07:08| Y'all won't have to be present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=7628)|
| 2:07:10| It'll probably not be on our agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=7630)|
| 2:07:12| He'll withdraw and it won't even appear on the agenda anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=7632)|
| 2:07:17| So we'll just defer it for 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=7637)|
| 2:07:21| That's your motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=7641)|
| 2:07:22| Do I have a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=7642)|
| 2:07:23| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=7643)|
| 2:07:24| Buzz.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=7644)|
| 2:07:25| I think that letter would officially go to county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=7645)|
| 2:07:28| It wouldn't come to us because it's past MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=7648)|
| 2:07:31| But that letter withdrawal or him being here at the meeting asking for withdrawal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=7651)|
| 2:07:36| that would be to commission, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=7656)|
| 2:07:40| According to the clerk, it needs to be notarized, Jeff, if you'll get with Mr. Testament.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=7660)|
| 2:07:44| Commissioner Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=7664)|
| 2:07:45| I just want to make a comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=7665)|
| 2:07:46| A person doesn't have to own the property to make a zoning change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=7666)|
| 2:07:51| We have developers come down here and there's probably going to be some today is where they have options on the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=7671)|
| 2:07:56| And the option is going to be dependent on whether they can get the zoning changed or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=7676)|
| 2:08:02| But they're acting as an agent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=7682)|
| 2:08:03| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=7683)|
| 2:08:04| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=7684)|
| 2:08:05| But they don't have to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=7685)|
| 2:08:07| You don't have to own the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=7687)|
| 2:08:09| Unlike the Fox Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=7689)|
| 2:08:10| He was under contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=7690)|
| 2:08:11| Most of these developers haven't bought the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=7691)|
| 2:08:13| They just have an option to buy it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=7693)|
| 2:08:15| And they're not going to buy it unless they can get the zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=7695)|
| 2:08:17| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=7697)|
| 2:08:18| So if they don't purchase the property, then the rezoning still stands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=7698)|
| 2:08:23| Is that what you're saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=7703)|
| 2:08:24| Not if we don't vote on it, it doesn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=7704)|
| 2:08:25| Well, but, I mean, if you vote on it, like had Mr. Testament been here today and he requested this and got the rezoning changed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=7705)|
| 2:08:33| then tomorrow he determined he wasn't going to buy the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=7713)|
| 2:08:36| Does the rezoning still stand?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=7716)|
| 2:08:38| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=7718)|
| 2:08:39| We would also like for it to be noted that that was a false statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=7719)|
| 2:08:43| Can you get your name and your address?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=7723)|
| 2:08:44| My name is Felicia Fortune.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=7724)|
| 2:08:46| I live at 1111 Hampson Lane, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37919.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=7726)|
| 2:08:50| This is the property in question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=7730)|
| 2:08:52| That was never a true statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=7732)|
| 2:08:54| He was never an agent for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=7734)|
| 2:08:56| Did he have the option to buy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=7736)|
| 2:08:59| He was an agent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=7739)|
| 2:09:00| But that's here and there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=7740)|
| 2:09:01| Okay, the motion on the floor is to defer for 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=7741)|
| 2:09:04| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=7744)|
| 2:09:05| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=7745)|
| 2:09:06| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=7746)|
| 2:09:07| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=7747)|
| 2:09:12| First item is 5-A-11-SNC, requests of Tim Burchett, Knox County Mayor, for a street name change for Dade Drive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=7752)|
| 2:09:22| streets located between Corn Valley Drive and Coward Mill Road in the 6th Commission District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=7762)|
| 2:09:28| Do I have a motion on the floor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=7768)|
| 2:09:29| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=7769)|
| 2:09:30| Is there any opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=7770)|
| 2:09:33| Motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=7773)|
| 2:09:34| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=7774)|
| 2:09:37| And Dade Drive was first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=7777)|
| 2:09:41| And Larry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=7781)|
| 2:09:43| Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=7783)|
| 2:09:44| What's the street name?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=7784)|
| 2:09:45| It's some man's name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=7785)|

| 2:09:52| We don't know the name of the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=7792)|
| 2:09:54| Mr. Donaldson, do you know the name of the street?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=7794)|
| 2:09:56| Burchett Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=7796)|
| 2:09:58| Burchett Boulevard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=7798)|
| 2:10:00| That's from?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=7800)|
| 2:10:01| Charlie Burchett Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=7801)|
| 2:10:02| From Dade Drive to Chuck Jones Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=7802)|
| 2:10:06| Chuck Jones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=7806)|
| 2:10:08| It's about a block.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=7808)|
| 2:10:09| Chuck Jones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=7809)|
| 2:10:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=7813)|
| 2:10:14| Mr. Jones is the Knox County's Director of Veteran Affairs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=7814)|
| 2:10:17| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=7817)|
| 2:10:18| Oh, that's for a long number of years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=7818)|
| 2:10:20| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=7820)|
| 2:10:21| That's near the nursing home there, the veteran's home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=7821)|
| 2:10:24| We've got a motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=7824)|
| 2:10:25| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=7825)|
| 2:10:26| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=7826)|
| 2:10:27| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=7827)|
| 2:10:28| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=7828)|
| 2:10:29| Ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=7829)|
| 2:10:30| Ready?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=7830)|
| 2:10:31| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=7831)|
| 2:10:32| The next item is 4-A-11-SAP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=7832)|
| 2:10:35| Request of Knox County Commission for an update to the East County Sector Plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=7835)|
| 2:10:42| Do we have a motion on the floor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=7842)|
| 2:10:49| Is there a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=7849)|
| 2:10:55| If there isn't, there is no motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=7855)|
| 2:10:58| Mr. Donaldson, this says that we are the applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=7858)|
| 2:11:00| How are we the applicant on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=7860)|
| 2:11:02| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=7862)|
| 2:11:08| Last year, MPC adopted the East County Sector Plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=7868)|
| 2:11:11| It came to the county commission and the county commission chose not to make it operative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=7871)|
| 2:11:17| by an affirmative vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=7877)|
| 2:11:19| And the following month, initiated their own version of the East County Sector Plan update,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=7879)|
| 2:11:25| reverting the area around the Midway Park proposed business, Midway Road proposed business park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=7885)|
| 2:11:35| to the land use plan classifications that were in place prior to the development corporation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=7895)|
| 2:11:42| application for a plan amendment and rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=7902)|
| 2:11:47| We recommended to you a version of that plan dated early in 2006 before that application| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=7907)|
| 2:11:58| that would take the development corporation's land back to low-density residential land use plan classification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=7918)|
| 2:12:06| And there was a corner, a 10-acre parcel at the corner of Midway Road and Thorn Grove Pike| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=7926)|
| 2:12:12| that was in the process, actually a month before the development corporation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=7932)|
| 2:12:17| but was ultimately heard on the same meeting date as the development corporation's application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=7937)|
| 2:12:26| That parcel had been recommended by, approved by the planning commission for commercial classification| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=7946)|
| 2:12:36| and a planned commercial zone district and also approved by the county commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=7956)|
| 2:12:45| for commercial land use plan classification and planned commercial zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=7965)|
| 2:12:53| That property was captured in the lawsuit, unknowns to the property owner and unknown to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=7973)|
| 2:13:01| And we didn't learn about that until literally days before the planning commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=7981)|
| 2:13:07| considered your sector plan update amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=7987)|
| 2:13:13| So we postponed for a month and looked at it again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=7993)|
| 2:13:19| We feel that that 10-acre piece at the corner has merit for a commercial land use plan designation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=7999)|
| 2:13:27| given that nearly 400 acres of land around it is being changed to low-density residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=8007)|
| 2:13:34| and could have development on it up to five units of the acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=8014)|
| 2:13:39| So you're looking at 1,500 to 2,000 potential homes in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=8019)|
| 2:13:43| There are many, but I guess my question is, and right now we don't have a motion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=8023)|
| 2:13:53| so it's really soon to be a dead issue it sounds like, but what we sent back to you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=8033)|
| 2:13:59| it had nothing to do, it had everything to do with taking the plan, the east sector plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=8039)|
| 2:14:07| with EC07 back to low-density residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=8047)|
| 2:14:12| That wasn't even in our plan for you to consider approval on MPC, the neighborhood commercial on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=8052)|
| 2:14:20| It was. The intent was to take it back to a position prior to the lawsuit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=8060)|
| 2:14:29| We didn't know that that parcel was in the lawsuit, so we didn't know that that parcel should have been in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=8069)|
| 2:14:37| But it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=8077)|
| 2:14:40| So you have the option of adopting your plan amendment with that 10-acre parcel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=8080)|
| 2:14:50| either low-density residential or commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=8090)|
| 2:14:55| Who owns the property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=8095)|
| 2:14:57| It's now owned by a bank. I think it's Clayton Bank.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=8097)|
| 2:15:00| Have they expressed interest in zoning?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=8100)|
| 2:15:03| I'm sure they will. They haven't applied for rezoning at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=8103)|
| 2:15:07| The first step is to get a plan amendment in place that would allow it to be rezoned to what they thought they had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=8107)|
| 2:15:15| Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=8115)|
| 2:15:20| I think that we've got ourselves into a position, as I can best explain it, that we probably need the property to return to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=8120)|
| 2:15:33| its pre-lawsuit status.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=8133)|
| 2:15:39| And I think that was our, as I'm hearing here from Commissioner Brown in my other ear,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=8139)|
| 2:15:44| that was probably our intent whenever we sent our plan over to MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=8144)|
| 2:15:52| The thing I'd like to see happen right now tonight, I guess, is for us to reemphasize that was our intent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=8152)|
| 2:16:02| Or really what I'd like to see is it just be like it is, which you think it's probably low-density residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=8162)|
| 2:16:14| and those pre-lawsuit plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=8174)|
| 2:16:18| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=8178)|
| 2:16:19| And if it's low-density residential and it has a property owner, and just as North Shore and Chota Road came before us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=8179)|
| 2:16:30| and we liked that, and as Fox Road Marina Restaurant came before us and we didn't like Mr. Kennedy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=8190)|
| 2:16:39| the outcome of this will be as whoever presents their plan, we're not dealing with what-ifs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=8199)|
| 2:16:48| Dr. Briggs had brought us into a conversation last week about the natural resource recovery property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=8208)|
| 2:16:57| What's its highest and best zoning use?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=8217)|
| 2:16:59| I don't think that's up to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=8219)|
| 2:17:01| I believe it's up to the property owner to come with a plan, and then we like it and we approve it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=8221)|
| 2:17:08| or we don't like it and we don't approve it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=8228)|
| 2:17:11| So leaving this, we apparently don't have to do anything tonight if we just want to leave it as low-density residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=8231)|
| 2:17:19| That's not true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=8239)|
| 2:17:22| You've got to act on a plan amendment in order to adopt the other 99% of the East County Sector Plan update| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=8242)|
| 2:17:29| that everybody agrees on, but you can approve your plan amendment subject to changing just that 10-acre parcel back to LDR,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=8249)|
| 2:17:39| plus the development corporation land back to LDR.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=8259)|
| 2:17:43| We had to deal with them separately because the map that we had provided you in framing the resolution to initiate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=8263)|
| 2:17:51| the amendment included that 10-acre parcel as a commercial land use plan designation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=8271)|
| 2:17:58| Okay, so really though, on what's before us right now, what we've just read, we don't have to take action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=8278)|
| 2:18:06| What we do need to do is move that the, and I'm not making a motion right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=8286)|
| 2:18:14| I'm just saying what needs to happen is that we reinforce the idea that we sent a couple of months ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=8294)|
| 2:18:23| and that the East Sector Plan be approved as we have submitted using your plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=8303)|
| 2:18:31| except for this particular piece of property which we want to remain as it was in the 2000-2001 Sector Plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=8311)|
| 2:18:39| That's a motion that would do the job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=8319)|
| 2:18:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=8322)|
| 2:18:43| But you do have, this is not like other things on an agenda where if you merely don't take action, it just dies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=8323)|
| 2:18:49| It does take some affirmative action, even if the action is to maintain status quo back to the way it was years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=8329)|
| 2:18:57| Commissioner Olinby.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=8337)|
| 2:18:58| I really like that motion, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=8338)|
| 2:18:59| That was a great motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=8339)|
| 2:19:00| You're going to make that a substitute motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=8340)|
| 2:19:01| That would have been a great motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=8341)|
| 2:19:02| There is no motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=8342)|
| 2:19:04| It wouldn't be a substitute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=8344)|
| 2:19:08| We will make the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=8348)|
| 2:19:09| You're making that as a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=8349)|
| 2:19:10| So your motion is, hey, Dave, will you state your motion again for us, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=8350)|
| 2:19:14| I would move that the East County Sector Plan as presented by commission to MPC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=8354)|
| 2:19:25| which makes ECO-7 low-density residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=8365)|
| 2:19:32| and it's the plan that you all have worked on for two or three years, except for that one ECO-7,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=8372)|
| 2:19:40| that that be made operative or approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=8380)|
| 2:19:44| And specifically mention that the 10-acre piece should revert to low-density residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=8384)|
| 2:19:53| Is that yours?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=8393)|
| 2:19:54| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=8394)|
| 2:19:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=8395)|
| 2:19:56| You're done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=8396)|
| 2:19:57| Commissioner Olinby.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=8397)|
| 2:20:00| I'm just trying to understand this, because when we voted on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=8400)|
| 2:20:04| my understanding was that we would implement the sector plan as it was 2000-2001,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=8404)|
| 2:20:15| which this piece of property that is Clayton Banks now was agricultural.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=8415)|
| 2:20:21| Am I not correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=8421)|
| 2:20:23| Was it not agricultural?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=8423)|
| 2:20:24| It was zoned agricultural.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=8424)|
| 2:20:26| Zoning was agricultural, but the land use plan classification was low-density residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=8426)|
| 2:20:31| And I agree with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=8431)|
| 2:20:33| There's a difference in current zoning and planned zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=8433)|
| 2:20:36| I'm just trying to make sure we're all on the same page here before I vote on something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=8436)|
| 2:20:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=8441)|
| 2:20:42| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=8442)|
| 2:20:43| So the motion on the floor is to make the East County Sector Plan operable with the ECO-7.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=8443)|
| 2:20:54| And the 10 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=8454)|
| 2:20:55| And that 10 acres is in ECO-7.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=8455)|
| 2:21:00| With that 10 acres being low-density residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=8460)|
| 2:21:04| In the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=8464)|
| 2:21:05| In the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=8465)|
| 2:21:06| Not their zoning, just their plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=8466)|
| 2:21:07| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=8467)|
| 2:21:08| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=8468)|
| 2:21:09| Motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=8469)|
| 2:21:10| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=8470)|

| 2:21:14| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=8474)|
| 2:21:22| The next item is 5-B-11-SP, request of Tennessee Children's Home for Northwest County Sector Plan amendment from LDR low-density| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=8482)|

| 2:22:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=8527)|
| 2:22:08| Sir, state your name and your address and make any statements you want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=8528)|
| 2:22:11| You have five minutes if you need it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=8531)|
| 2:22:12| I'm Damon Falconier at 11605 Gates Mill Drive in Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=8532)|
| 2:22:18| I'm here to answer any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=8538)|
| 2:22:20| Just to be clear, it was approved by MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=8540)|
| 2:22:23| Commissioner Norman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=8543)|
| 2:22:25| Because it involves slope, I've always got an issue there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=8545)|
| 2:22:28| And this may be to the staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=8548)|
| 2:22:31| Staff approval on this, Buzz, Mark?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=8551)|
| 2:22:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=8554)|
| 2:22:35| In the slope area, what kind of slope are we talking about?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=8555)|
| 2:22:47| I wish you'd walk 78%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=8567)|
| 2:22:50| What's that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=8570)|
| 2:22:51| I'd like to see that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=8571)|
| 2:22:54| We didn't do a detailed analysis, but I think we were familiar enough with the site that the slope didn't appear to be a substantial problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=8574)|
| 2:23:04| Not much of the site is under slope protection area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=8584)|
| 2:23:09| Plus, we feel like that we can, when the site plan comes in, we can deal with it at that level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=8589)|
| 2:23:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=8594)|
| 2:23:15| Can you tell us a little bit about the plan relative to slope?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=8595)|
| 2:23:18| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=8598)|
| 2:23:19| In your packet, there's a master plan showing, and we are able to not be in that slope protection area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=8599)|
| 2:23:27| So we would be able to...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=8607)|
| 2:23:30| No excavation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=8610)|
| 2:23:31| Not in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=8611)|
| 2:23:32| No clearing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=8612)|
| 2:23:33| No grading?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=8613)|
| 2:23:34| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=8614)|
| 2:23:35| We want to keep those trees in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=8615)|

| 2:23:46| I guess now we need to work on the rezoning for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=8626)|
| 2:23:50| The rezoning is item 2-B-11-RZ.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=8630)|

| 2:25:10| That's all right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=8710)|
| 2:25:11| I do have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=8711)|
| 2:25:12| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=8712)|
| 2:25:13| When properties come, and this is for staff, when they come like this and go back to ag, is there a, I mean, what's the amount of time before somebody could come again for a rezoning?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=8713)|
| 2:25:30| Would it be a year or more?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=8730)|
| 2:25:32| The same property owner would be a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=8732)|
| 2:25:35| No, since you're approving the zoning, nothing is being denied, so they literally could get another offer next month and come back and reapply.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=8735)|
| 2:25:45| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=8745)|
| 2:25:46| How long was this in the I designation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=8746)|
| 2:25:51| How many years has it been in I?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=8751)|
| 2:25:53| Does it abut industrial park?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=8753)|
| 2:25:55| I mean.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=8755)|
| 2:25:56| It's out in the East Bridge area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=8756)|
| 2:25:57| There's been substantial residential development in the periphery of East Bridge, and this is probably the third or fourth zoning case we've had in the last several years reverting from industrial to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=8757)|
| 2:26:14| So there's land that adjoins the East Bridge's boundaries that are I designations, and these are starting to go back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=8774)|
| 2:26:24| I got you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=8784)|
| 2:26:26| Is this true?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=8786)|
| 2:26:27| Let me ask a question, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=8787)|
| 2:26:28| Is this truly East Bridge, or was this industrial due to zinc?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=8788)|
| 2:26:35| I would suspect that when the sector plan was last updated, the planners looked at the area around East Bridge and tried to apply some logical boundaries to where that industrial activity might go,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=8795)|
| 2:26:51| and the river happened to be one of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=8811)|
| 2:26:55| That industrial activity hasn't taken off, and people are building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=8815)|
| 2:27:00| But this could have been industrial from the 30s, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=8820)|
| 2:27:03| I mean, let me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=8823)|
| 2:27:07| When did zoning take place?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=8827)|
| 2:27:09| When did this kind of activity take place in Knox County?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=8829)|
| 2:27:13| Zoning being established?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=8833)|
| 2:27:14| Well, in the 50s, early 60s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=8834)|
| 2:27:18| The only reason I ask that question is we've had this before, a month or two ago, and the person said it was because of refinancing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=8838)|
| 2:27:26| I'm not asking that question of the current property owner, but you see what this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=8846)|
| 2:27:31| There are areas in that vicinity close to the railroad that may have been rezoned industrial at the initial creation of the zoning map,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=8851)|
| 2:27:43| but I suspect that a lot of these also were done at the last sector plan update or two updates ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=8863)|
| 2:27:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=8869)|
| 2:27:50| I need to cast the vote again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=8870)|

| 2:27:52| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=8872)|

| 2:29:25| Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=8965)|
| 2:29:27| I just wanted to ask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=8967)|
| 2:29:30| Since Hardin Valley came up, I continue to go Pellissippi Parkway and get off at that exit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=8970)|
| 2:29:36| The east, just to the east of the exit, there is a mud, a vast mud flat, red clay mud flat that's been there for years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=8976)|
| 2:29:47| What is the status with that and why is it permissible for that to remain in that condition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=8987)|
| 2:29:57| What is the?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=8997)|
| 2:30:00| Well, if it is a project, why is it bare soil?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=9000)|
| 2:30:04| I mean, it's been that way for years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=9004)|
| 2:30:07| And I don't understand what the county, where we're failing in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=9007)|
| 2:30:12| Comments, whatever, Buzz.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=9012)|
| 2:30:16| Of course, a lot of that, the front part of that piece closest to Hardin Valley has been prepared for development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=9016)|
| 2:30:26| I think Mr. Russell has had two or three inquiries as to how that can be developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=9026)|
| 2:30:31| He's looked at two or three different plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=9031)|
| 2:30:34| The rezoning today would add a piece that was left out of the plant commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=9034)|
| 2:30:40| It put that in the plant commercial so it completes that zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=9040)|
| 2:30:44| Part of it has to do with the fact that the future relocation of Schaefer, is it Schaefer Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=9044)|
| 2:30:55| that will come around and connect in where you have the Cherry Hollow Boulevard intersection with Hardin Valley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=9055)|

| 2:31:04| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=9064)|
| 2:31:05| Part of that was graded out to provide that rough roadbed for hopefully that eventual connection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=9065)|
| 2:31:13| as to other reasons for, you know, the other part of the property being graded out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=9073)|
| 2:31:19| You'll have to ask the owner, the developer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=9079)|
| 2:31:23| And the owner developer is who?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=9083)|

| 2:31:36| And that was either withdrawn or denied before it could ever get into play.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=9096)|
| 2:31:43| A good, I won't say, I can't say all of it, but a good bit of that was done as a grading out for hopefully| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=9103)|
| 2:31:49| that future connection with Schaefer and relocation of Schaefer to take it off of the interchange.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=9109)|
| 2:31:55| Right now, Schaefer connects in with the interchange.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=9115)|
| 2:31:58| It's in the exit, in that curve of the exit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110627?start=9118)|
