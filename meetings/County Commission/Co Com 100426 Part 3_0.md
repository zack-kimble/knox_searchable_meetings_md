| 0:02:08| seen the the plan haven't seen specifics about say in my district in the third| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part3?start=128)|
| 0:02:16| district would there be proposed bike trails in each district that are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part3?start=136)|

| 0:02:40| their packets so that you can peruse it at leisure but um the plan does not lay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part3?start=160)|
| 0:02:45| out specific network a specific map what it does have is a policy that all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part3?start=165)|
| 0:02:50| new road projects would include bicycle accommodation and then we talk about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part3?start=170)|
| 0:02:55| identifying critical gaps in the network out there so we would be trying to find| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part3?start=175)|
| 0:03:00| critical gaps and then coming to you to fund those because of course funding is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part3?start=180)|
| 0:03:05| the big issue that's a limitation otherwise we would have a zillion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part3?start=185)|
| 0:03:08| greenways out there already okay thank you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part3?start=188)|

| 0:03:18| bicycle and have followed this isn't this already implemented on the state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part3?start=198)|
| 0:03:24| level I mean I know the plan or the policy yeah I mean I know it has a bike| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part3?start=204)|
| 0:03:32| accommodation policy since 2002 so to some extent yes but this is this plan is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part3?start=212)|
| 0:03:42| more than just these also there's encouragement programs education| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part3?start=222)|
| 0:03:46| programs and a lot more to it just then you know like lanes in the green yeah I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part3?start=226)|
| 0:03:51| guess what I was getting at is we're moving in the same direction our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part3?start=231)|
| 0:03:54| colleagues on the state has been and I'm proud to say that from my home now in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part3?start=234)|
| 0:04:00| Powell I can ride all the way to halls on the sidewalks with with good bicycle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part3?start=240)|
| 0:04:05| accommodations I can ride up Clinton Highway although that hill is pretty| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part3?start=245)|
| 0:04:10| rough throw the bike on a on a cat on a bus and be downtown so it's gotten| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part3?start=250)|
| 0:04:17| better and and I think as time goes on you're gonna see even chubby guys like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part3?start=257)|
| 0:04:22| me riding around on bicycles mr. Lambert do you know it's illegal to ride bikes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part3?start=262)|
| 0:04:28| on sidewalks not in the county not in the city either actually yeah it's not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part3?start=268)|
| 0:04:33| illegal in the city or the county here for a lot of cities it is but but not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part3?start=273)|
| 0:04:37| yeah I mean the rule of thumb I always follow is it's how fast you're going if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part3?start=277)|
| 0:04:41| I'm going if I'm going faster than sidewalk traffic I get on the road if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part3?start=281)|
| 0:04:47| I'm going slower which is most often the case unfortunately then sidewalk traffic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part3?start=287)|
| 0:04:52| and I stay on the sidewalk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part3?start=292)|
| 0:04:58| commissioner Saunders Thank You mr. chairman there's thank you for putting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part3?start=298)|

| 0:05:12| mentioned when new roads are planned and so forth state highways here I hope| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part3?start=312)|
| 0:05:20| because that comes I assume with some TDOT money and the CMAQ money that would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part3?start=320)|
| 0:05:24| do the well the the policy is for all new projects so if a road is getting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part3?start=324)|
| 0:05:30| widened or if there's a new road if there's federal money federal money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part3?start=330)|
| 0:05:35| coming through the state to us if that money is involved then it would need to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part3?start=335)|
| 0:05:39| include a bicycle accommodation whether that's a bike lane or a wide outside| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part3?start=339)|
| 0:05:44| lane and actually the the plan has been adopted by the TPO which includes the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part3?start=344)|

| 0:08:07| should have told you this earlier MPC should explain to you that there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part3?start=487)|
| 0:08:10| actually an either or an option tied to this and I'll defer to them yeah that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part3?start=490)|
| 0:08:17| correct mr. chair we the first option that you have option a and the reason we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part3?start=497)|
| 0:08:22| had we we we made the recommendation to approve both that is and we wanted to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part3?start=502)|
| 0:08:29| give you the opportunity to choose one or the other without having to send| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part3?start=509)|
| 0:08:33| everything back to MPC if that was the course of action you chose to take but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part3?start=513)|
| 0:08:37| option a directly responds to the charge that you all approved back at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part3?start=517)|
| 0:08:44| your February meeting for MPC to take a look at the the section of the zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part3?start=524)|
| 0:08:50| ordinance were with regard to the representation that the BZA had and to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part3?start=530)|
| 0:08:58| look at not only making the the districts line up with the County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part3?start=538)|
| 0:09:03| Commission your your Commission districts but also adding language that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part3?start=543)|
| 0:09:07| would prohibit any BZA member from holding another point or a public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part3?start=547)|
| 0:09:10| office while serving on the board so that was the simple change that's option| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part3?start=550)|
| 0:09:18| a when we looked at it and looked at that entire section we also and this was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part3?start=558)|
| 0:09:25| our initiative to look at also the selection how board members are selected| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part3?start=565)|
| 0:09:32| in terms of how they are now if we if we read the the ordinance correctly it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part3?start=572)|
| 0:09:39| nine members each member has a you choose one member each year so that the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part3?start=579)|
| 0:09:46| total term would be nine years for each member we propose a can more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part3?start=586)|
| 0:09:51| conventional setup where you choose two members each year one year you'd have to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part3?start=591)|
| 0:09:57| choose three because you'd have the odd number of districts but you would choose| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part3?start=597)|
| 0:10:01| two members each year buzz if I could just interrupt you real quick please do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part3?start=601)|
| 0:10:06| and the law director| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part3?start=606)|
| 0:10:12| because the weasel like a jack-in-the-box the room but I can't hide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part3?start=612)|
| 0:10:19| apparently there are actually 11 districts because it's not seats 9 and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part3?start=619)|
| 0:10:27| 10 it's just I mean 10 and 11 it's districts 10 and 11 which encompass the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part3?start=627)|
| 0:10:33| entire county so are we saying that those that hold district seats 10 and 11| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part3?start=633)|
| 0:10:44| don't get to choose and how do we get around that because I see problems with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part3?start=644)|
| 0:10:52| that mr. our district seat 10 and 11 aren't districts yes they are they are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part3?start=652)|
| 0:10:57| large seats or do you have larges are called within the Charter Amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part3?start=657)|
| 0:11:04| they're called districts 10 and 11 not seats they are districts 10 and 11 but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part3?start=664)|
| 0:11:11| they're also those verbs in that it says at-large as well which might define some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part3?start=671)|
| 0:11:17| some well they are still they're still defined as districts I think they're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part3?start=677)|
| 0:11:24| called district but that at-large I think defines what they are the verbiage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part3?start=684)|
| 0:11:28| before us though and what MPC is bringing is they're saying seats just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part3?start=688)|
| 0:11:35| seats 1 through 9 well if they want to say districts 1 through 9 that's fine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part3?start=695)|
| 0:11:40| and now they're saying seats 1 through 9 there's no relationship between seats| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part3?start=700)|
| 0:11:49| 1 through 9 on the Board of Zoning Appeals and whatever the size of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part3?start=709)|
| 0:11:54| Commission is Commission right now is 19 the Board of Zoning Appeals is only 9| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part3?start=714)|
| 0:12:00| Commission's going to be 11 yes the Board of Zoning Appeals still going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part3?start=720)|
| 0:12:04| be 9 that's right okay so when you're trying to align up seat 1 BZA with seat| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part3?start=724)|
| 0:12:10| or district 1 that's all it's that's all it is district 1 oh yeah I just want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part3?start=730)|
| 0:12:16| to make sure that it actually states that these will be aligned with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part3?start=736)|
| 0:12:20| districts 1 through 9 not all districts so in other words districts 1 through 9| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part3?start=740)|
| 0:12:24| okay that is if you choose option B that's that's the that's the extra item| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part3?start=744)|
| 0:12:31| we added to option A and that is to look at if you were if you felt like you were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part3?start=751)|
| 0:12:37| wanted to consider going to a somewhat more conventional way to select the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part3?start=757)|
| 0:12:41| members of the BZA two members per year until the rotation of the rotation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part3?start=761)|
| 0:12:48| would be a little quicker and you and they would serve a more conventional| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part3?start=768)|
| 0:12:52| four-year term is and I guess the the two-term limit it's still applicable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part3?start=772)|
| 0:12:59| because we do have a resolution that says that you can serve on a board no| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part3?start=779)|
| 0:13:05| more than two times the ordinance amendments doesn't speak to to that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part3?start=785)|
| 0:13:10| particular issue now if there's an overriding County Code I guess that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part3?start=790)|
| 0:13:14| would take press and the ordinance change does not speak to the limited to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part3?start=794)|
| 0:13:17| two terms the Commissioner right what yes the Commission certainly could amend| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part3?start=797)|
| 0:13:27| the language to add after the term districts and add one through nine to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part3?start=807)|
| 0:13:34| very explicit about I think it would be wise okay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part3?start=814)|
| 0:13:39| Commissioner right Thank You mr. chairman as I see what's before us they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part3?start=819)|
| 0:13:46| are offering us a way of doing this two options the first option option a was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part3?start=826)|
| 0:13:53| the appointment of an individual apparently to serve nine years because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part3?start=833)|
| 0:13:58| every year one person fell off so that means the others are all still there so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part3?start=838)|
| 0:14:04| if our two-term limit worked on that scenario person could technically be on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part3?start=844)|
| 0:14:09| the Board of Zoning Appeals for 18 years that's a long time that would be drudgery| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part3?start=849)|
| 0:14:17| so so for that very reason in itself by that definition I think option a is out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part3?start=857)|
| 0:14:22| the second option be giving more traditional appointments and half the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part3?start=862)|
| 0:14:30| people being on and half the people being off the next year to me fits well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part3?start=870)|
| 0:14:37| or looks like it's okay but the thing that I still would have difficulty with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part3?start=877)|
| 0:14:42| is that if it's a four-year term and they get a second term that would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part3?start=882)|
| 0:14:48| eight years on the BZA and that's only one year less than what I just didn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part3?start=888)|
| 0:14:54| like to begin with so I think that the the term ought to be two years that this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part3?start=894)|
| 0:15:01| is a citizen review panel the more frequently they turn over the more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part3?start=901)|
| 0:15:06| citizens become involved in county government and I think the better we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part3?start=906)|
| 0:15:11| would be for it people probably would serve four years could possibly serve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part3?start=911)|
| 0:15:16| for four years so I wouldn't like to see us amend the four-year term to be two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part3?start=916)|
| 0:15:22| year terms and then recognize the fact that we have a background rule that says| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part3?start=922)|
| 0:15:28| people can be appointed to boards or committees or commissions or whatever| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part3?start=928)|
| 0:15:33| for two consecutive terms. Buzz did I hear you wrong because if we did option| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part3?start=933)|
| 0:15:39| B you'd be dropping two off and in one year be three and that would be a four| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part3?start=939)|
| 0:15:47| year term is that not correct? That's correct. That assumes you're going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part3?start=947)|
| 0:15:52| once those two come back around you know and if they were to two terms you assume| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part3?start=952)|
| 0:15:57| you're going to. That would get you down to at the max in eight years with two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part3?start=957)|
| 0:16:04| terms correct? That's correct. Is that not are you so are you wanting to limit it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part3?start=964)|
| 0:16:10| that someone can only serve as long as four years on BZA? I was proposing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part3?start=970)|
| 0:16:16| that a person be appointed for two years the board would be appointed every| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part3?start=976)|
| 0:16:20| other half the people would be appointed every other year well not half seven| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part3?start=980)|
| 0:16:26| eight and nine is in one cycle and that's actually three seats but every| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part3?start=986)|
| 0:16:35| other year let's back up for just a second for those that remember how BZA| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part3?start=995)|
| 0:16:39| was composed when when it was of commissioners was the BZA appointment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part3?start=999)|
| 0:16:44| for two years? No it was it was not a BZA appointment I believe was for four I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part3?start=1004)|
| 0:16:49| think it was for the we did that at the beginning we did it at the beginning of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part3?start=1009)|
| 0:16:56| a brand new election cycle that was done through the committee on committees and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part3?start=1016)|
| 0:17:01| that was for a four-year term Mr. Pinkston is that what you recall? That's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part3?start=1021)|
| 0:17:06| correct. And they would serve for that entire four-year term as a commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part3?start=1026)|
| 0:17:11| and as a BZA unless they decided to resign. In every election we had to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part3?start=1031)|
| 0:17:16| reappoint. In every election were you yeah. I still think that two years on BZA| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part3?start=1036)|
| 0:17:24| with the possibilities of being two more years is sufficient for a citizen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part3?start=1044)|
| 0:17:28| appointed committee. Okay I can go along with it you want to amend it to make it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part3?start=1048)|
| 0:17:35| two years instead of the four years that they've got there? I would like to offer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part3?start=1055)|
| 0:17:40| that amendment. Do you wish to because commission is going to be getting to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part3?start=1060)|
| 0:17:45| staggered terms as well are you wishing to align so that the BZA no I'm no I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part3?start=1065)|
| 0:17:52| thinking out loud no. No you are thinking correctly every year half the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part3?start=1072)|
| 0:17:59| people come on. Yes. Every year half the people need to come on that way it's a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part3?start=1079)|
| 0:18:04| two-year term. Are you wanting to go I guess five one time and four another?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part3?start=1084)|
| 0:18:10| That's correct. Okay. Because that's the way they have it written up except this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part3?start=1090)|
| 0:18:14| with four-year terms. Right two or two. Two, two and three. Two, two, two, three. I think yours| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part3?start=1094)|
| 0:18:20| would be four. Four and five. Five and four either way. Okay. Yes. And is that what you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part3?start=1100)|
| 0:18:26| would like to make as a motion? I'll make that motion. I'll second that. We have a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part3?start=1106)|
| 0:18:31| second. Commissioner Lambert. Mr. Law Director does state statute not allow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part3?start=1111)|
| 0:18:37| the County Commission to serve as the Board of Zoning Appeals? No sir the most| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part3?start=1117)|
| 0:18:46| recent ruling we have is that because you're the appointive body you can't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part3?start=1126)|
| 0:18:50| self-appoint and the Tennessee Code does outline the manner in which you'll form| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part3?start=1130)|
| 0:18:56| a Board of Zoning Appeals including membership which if you're a chartered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part3?start=1136)|
| 0:19:00| county like ours it'll be up to nine members and likewise you'll have to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part3?start=1140)|
| 0:19:05| arrange the terms in terms of their fashion they shouldn't exceed five years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part3?start=1145)|
| 0:19:10| in length so no at this point you can't self-appoint to the BZA. Well what I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part3?start=1150)|
| 0:19:15| was wondering or maybe I'm thinking a beer board that you can just choose can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part3?start=1155)|
| 0:19:19| is this one of those where you can choose not to have a BZA and then the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part3?start=1159)|
| 0:19:25| commission becomes the BZA? Well the the way the statute reads that you're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part3?start=1165)|
| 0:19:31| empowered to create a Board of Zoning Appeals so you're likewise empowered to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part3?start=1171)|
| 0:19:36| dissolve it but then trying to reconstitute it as part of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part3?start=1176)|
| 0:19:40| commission I think would run afoul of state law. Okay. So I think what you have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part3?start=1180)|
| 0:19:44| right now is is the legal methodology. Okay just just looking for a way to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part3?start=1184)|
| 0:19:48| simplify. I understand sir that's what this is one of these oddities there is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part3?start=1188)|
| 0:19:51| preemptive state law. Commissioner Wright. I think that if Mr. Law Director you said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part3?start=1191)|
| 0:19:58| the magic number was nine the Board of State Law on the composition of number| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part3?start=1198)|
| 0:20:04| of people on the Board of Zoning Appeals. Five seven or nine members is what the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part3?start=1204)|
| 0:20:10| statute reads in terms of the year membership. And if we look at the beer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part3?start=1210)|
| 0:20:14| board we can sit as a beer board because we sit inside the number that state law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part3?start=1214)|
| 0:20:20| allows for the beer board. Well also the the statute specifically permits you to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part3?start=1220)|
| 0:20:25| either sit as the body politic or create a citizen board but the BZA doesn't give| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part3?start=1225)|
| 0:20:31| you that luxury. And the BZA is composed of two less than the number of future| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part3?start=1231)|
| 0:20:38| commissioners. Yeah the BZA doesn't the way the state created the BZA is that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part3?start=1238)|
| 0:20:44| it's a essentially a quasi judicial board that shouldn't really be tied well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part3?start=1244)|
| 0:20:48| maybe that's a little strong but it wasn't constituted with the idea in mind| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part3?start=1248)|
| 0:20:52| that you link it up and make it representative of each Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part3?start=1252)|
| 0:20:56| district. The only thing that the state was worried about is the number five| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part3?start=1256)|
| 0:20:59| seven or nine but the state doesn't make a corollary telling you to align it with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part3?start=1259)|
| 0:21:05| your Commission districts. And I'm not making that corollary either what I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part3?start=1265)|
| 0:21:08| getting at is the fact that our Commission size is not nine it's eleven.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part3?start=1268)|
| 0:21:13| Correct. So by definition we cannot sit as a board of zoning appeals because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part3?start=1273)|
| 0:21:19| there are eleven commissioners. Now it might be open in my interpretation that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part3?start=1279)|
| 0:21:23| if we were a board of if we were Knox County Commission composed of nine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part3?start=1283)|
| 0:21:29| members then there might be room for argument that it could be BZA but not as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part3?start=1289)|
| 0:21:35| 11. So anyway I agree with what you're saying. Yes Mark. Chairman the Planning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part3?start=1295)|
| 0:21:44| Commission considered only the four-year term there is a requirement that you get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part3?start=1304)|
| 0:21:49| a recommendation or to at least have the Planning Commission consider everything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part3?start=1309)|
| 0:21:54| that you act upon with regard to the zoning ordinance. You may have to send| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part3?start=1314)|
| 0:21:59| this back to the Planning Commission to consider two years as the required time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part3?start=1319)|
| 0:22:04| Law Director. Yes sir. Can you answer that question? The issue is that the Planning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part3?start=1324)|
| 0:22:14| Commission did not consider a two-year term in making its recommendation they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part3?start=1334)|
| 0:22:18| considered only the four-year term. Or a nine-year term. Or a nine. Well I mean it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part3?start=1338)|
| 0:22:24| can be considered a substantial change that has to go back I mean obviously if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part3?start=1344)|
| 0:22:28| you're gonna take the most conservative safest approach you follow your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part3?start=1348)|
| 0:22:32| established methodology would be to refer it back and because that's a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part3?start=1352)|
| 0:22:35| substantial change I mean that could affect who would even be interested in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part3?start=1355)|
| 0:22:39| serving. Some people prefer a protracted appointment others don't. We're not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part3?start=1359)|
| 0:22:46| ready to rush. I'd like to make a substitute motion to refer it back. Actually I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part3?start=1366)|
| 0:22:50| believe we are on a substitute motion are we not? Just a minute. Well we had it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part3?start=1370)|
| 0:22:54| when we first came when Finance and Intergovernmental first gave the reports| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part3?start=1374)|
| 0:23:01| there was a motion to approve motion and then we had Commissioner Wright came| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part3?start=1381)|
| 0:23:07| back later on and said he's making a substitute motion to make it the two-year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part3?start=1387)|
| 0:23:12| term. Who seconded it? Mr. Pinkston. Commissioner Pinkston. But I can change my| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part3?start=1392)|
| 0:23:22| motion. Well we had a now if I'm right and I'm hey it's a long day but we had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part3?start=1402)|
| 0:23:33| an immediate motion to approve in a second as soon as the reports Commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part3?start=1413)|
| 0:23:39| Wright has came back and made a substitute motion saying making it option| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part3?start=1419)|
| 0:23:45| B and to make it a two-year term which is entirely different than the original| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part3?start=1425)|
| 0:23:51| motion. There was no second. He's withdrawing that and I am too if that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part3?start=1431)|
| 0:23:57| what he's wanting to do. Okay. So you're withdrawing the original so we the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part3?start=1437)|
| 0:24:01| substitute actually is now the original. Okay. Commissioner Wright. I move that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part3?start=1441)|
| 0:24:08| this be sent back to MPC with the request that the terms that the option B be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part3?start=1448)|
| 0:24:18| reconfigured to two-year terms rotating every year four and five. People on and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part3?start=1458)|
| 0:24:25| off. Is that what the second one? I'll second that. Okay second. All right. Any further| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part3?start=1465)|
| 0:24:30| discussion? All those in favor say aye. Aye. Opposed? Ayes have it. Next item. Next item is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part3?start=1470)|
