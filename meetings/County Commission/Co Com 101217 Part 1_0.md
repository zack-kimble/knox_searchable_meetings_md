| 0:03:27| Fy enw i yw Harold Hudson. Rwy'n gyfweliadwr rhwydwaith, 3130 Circle Oak Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=207)|
| 0:03:35| Ed Cox oedd y dyn sy'n rhannu'r bêr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=215)|
| 0:03:39| Yr hyn sydd wedi ei ddweud i mi yw bod y datiau wedi cael eu rhannu rhwng cigarethau a bêr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=219)|
| 0:03:48| Roedd e'n rhannu'r bêr, yn edrych arnyn nhw a dwi ddim yn gwybod a oedd e'n cardd iddyn nhw neu na, ond roedd e'n dweud ei fod.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=228)|
| 0:03:55| Roedd Ed wedi'i ddysgu. Rydyn ni wedi'i ddysgu.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=235)|
| 0:04:00| Yn fy mhobol, rwyf wedi cael fy nghymryd o'r stor. Roeddwn i'n mynd i gael cyfweliadwr i ddysgu cyfnodau.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=240)|
| 0:04:10| Ac mae fy mhobl wedi cael ei gyrraedd yn y stor, ac rwyf wedi'i ddysgu arno yn y diwydiant diwethaf.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=250)|
| 0:04:17| Felly, rydw i'n mynd i gael cyfweliadwr ar gyfer y stor fel y gallant ddysgu cyfnodau heb eu gweld arno.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=257)|
| 0:04:24| Felly, roeddech chi'n ymwneud â hynny pan oedd y swyddog yn ymwneud â hynny?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=264)|
| 0:04:27| Ie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=267)|
| 0:04:28| Felly, roeddech chi'n ymwneud â'r ffaithau sy'n ei ddysgu gan y swyddog?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=268)|
| 0:04:32| Roedd Ed wedi dweud ei fod wedi'i ddysgu cyfweliadwr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=272)|
| 0:04:35| Iawn. Diolch yn fawr. Nid oes cwestiynau eraill. Byddwn i'n ymwneud â'r Comisiwn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=275)|
| 0:04:38| Comisiwnwyr, a oes unrhyw gwestiynau neu a oes unrhyw un yn cael cyfweliad?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=278)|
| 0:04:43| Well, I will make a motion since this is the second offence that will be given the $1,000 fine over 60 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=283)|
| 0:04:53| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=293)|
| 0:04:55| First and seconded, Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=295)|
| 0:04:58| I guess I just have a question as a clarification as to maybe what was the first offence?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=298)|
| 0:05:04| I don't have mine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=304)|
| 0:05:05| December 9.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=305)|
| 0:05:09| Similar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=309)|
| 0:05:11| Same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=311)|
| 0:05:13| She misread the ID is what she said. She looked at the date incorrectly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=313)|
| 0:05:17| And that's why I'm going to – I've got a few options on the Internet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=317)|
| 0:05:20| I've looked up and seen some things to where they can run the IDs through it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=320)|
| 0:05:24| And they'll say whether they're 21 or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=324)|
| 0:05:26| I mean, that's the best thing because that's what I'm having problems with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=326)|
| 0:05:34| Just to remind you, you still have to check the person against that ID too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=334)|
| 0:05:38| Yes, sir. Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=338)|
| 0:05:40| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=340)|
| 0:05:41| I have a question. You said you were going to get a reader.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=341)|
| 0:05:43| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=343)|
| 0:05:44| When are you going to get this reader?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=344)|
| 0:05:46| Probably – well, I didn't know if you guys were going to pull it or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=346)|
| 0:05:50| So, after this next week, I'm going to get one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=350)|
| 0:05:53| I'd like the maker of the motion, Mike, would you – because a lot of people come to us and say they're going to do this, this, and this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=353)|
| 0:05:59| I don't know, Mike, if you want to put something on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=359)|
| 0:06:01| I would support it that they do it within so many months or whatever that they get this reader.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=361)|
| 0:06:06| That they show proof that they've got it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=366)|
| 0:06:09| I'll let it to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=369)|
| 0:06:12| I hesitate in this case because it's a little past the deadline, but this is actually the third offense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=372)|
| 0:06:19| And I think that they've been in business long enough now, they need to learn how to be doing this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=379)|
| 0:06:25| and we have to do something to control it, and I think this is one of the ways that we can do to control it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=385)|
| 0:06:30| So, I'll stand by my motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=390)|
| 0:06:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=393)|
| 0:06:35| Mr. Gooden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=395)|
| 0:06:37| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=397)|
| 0:06:38| I mean, sorry, did you have something else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=398)|
| 0:06:40| Joe, can we in the future, could we put that as a stipulation to some people?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=400)|
| 0:06:45| Well, Commissioner, really the only way you can compel them to make that purchase, if you do, for instance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=405)|
| 0:06:50| say you suspend a license, but you do it in such a manner that you can revoke the suspension| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=410)|
| 0:06:57| once they show proof of purchase, that's the best you can do there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=417)|
| 0:07:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=420)|
| 0:07:01| It would be great on your part, you get this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=421)|
| 0:07:04| if you would write us a letter saying, hey, I did purchase it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=424)|
| 0:07:07| Because a lot of people do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=427)|
| 0:07:08| They come to us and say, I'm going to do this, this, and this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=428)|
| 0:07:11| And we don't follow up with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=431)|
| 0:07:13| We take them at their word.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=433)|
| 0:07:14| So, you know, it would be great if somewhere down the road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=434)|
| 0:07:16| if you just let the Commissioner or the clerk's office know that you did do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=436)|
| 0:07:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=440)|
| 0:07:21| I'll get on there tonight and see which one I'm going to get.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=441)|
| 0:07:24| I've got a, there's one that I looked at at a station down in Knoxville that they, at this 166,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=444)|
| 0:07:31| and they say it works good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=451)|
| 0:07:32| So I'm going to see what that one is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=452)|
| 0:07:34| I'm probably going to buy that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=454)|
| 0:07:36| Wolfie, did you have?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=456)|
| 0:07:37| If you'll check with the Metropolitan Drug Commission, we had, what, two months ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=457)|
| 0:07:43| they brought one up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=463)|
| 0:07:45| They didn't have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=465)|
| 0:07:46| Another guy had it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=466)|
| 0:07:47| But they have access to the information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=467)|
| 0:07:48| If you'll get a hold of them at the Metropolitan Drug Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=468)|
| 0:07:51| they can get you that information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=471)|
| 0:07:53| Metropolitan Drug Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=473)|
| 0:07:54| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=474)|
| 0:07:55| I thought she'd be, there she is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=475)|
| 0:07:56| Okay, there's Karen, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=476)|
| 0:07:58| Wolfie, I'd like to recognize you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=478)|
| 0:07:59| You had had something to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=479)|
| 0:08:02| Commissioner Brown, he made my statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=482)|
| 0:08:04| I was going to say this was the third time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=484)|
| 0:08:09| Commissioner Burroughs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=489)|
| 0:08:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=492)|
| 0:08:14| We often hear at these meetings that the clerk didn't do the correct arithmetic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=494)|
| 0:08:20| or they didn't read the birthday right or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=500)|
| 0:08:23| And it's my understanding that if you're legal drinking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=503)|
| 0:08:26| or if you're under legal drinking age, there's a red stripe on the ID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=506)|
| 0:08:31| So there's no need for anybody to even attempt to do any mathematics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=511)|
| 0:08:35| They just need to look and see if it's got that stripe or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=515)|
| 0:08:37| So I don't accept that as a valid excuse for selling beer to underage kids| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=517)|
| 0:08:44| because you don't have to do math or even look at the birth date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=524)|
| 0:08:47| You just need to look at whether that red stripe is there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=527)|
| 0:08:50| So I would like to look as a condition of going forward that they do purchase the reader,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=530)|
| 0:08:58| not in lieu of the fine, since this is the third offense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=538)|
| 0:09:02| I would prefer to see the maximum fine that we can give them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=542)|
| 0:09:05| and require him to buy the card reader by the end of 60 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=545)|
| 0:09:09| Do you have a substitute motion you'd like to make?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=549)|
| 0:09:11| Yes, unless Mike would be willing to amend it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=551)|
| 0:09:15| Mr. Jarrett has a caution here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=555)|
| 0:09:17| You really can't compel them to make that kind of expense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=557)|
| 0:09:21| The only thing you can do is, for instance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=561)|
| 0:09:22| you tell somebody we're going to suspend your license for 60 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=562)|
| 0:09:27| However, if before seven days you purchase this, then we'll suspend the suspension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=567)|
| 0:09:33| But you can't just compel them to make that purchase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=573)|
| 0:09:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=576)|
| 0:09:37| Could we give them a fine and say, or does it have to be either or,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=577)|
| 0:09:47| or can we not do both and say we'll withdraw the suspension if you buy this equipment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=587)|
| 0:09:52| You can't fine and suspend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=592)|
| 0:09:54| No, your procedure has been, and the way it's codified,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=594)|
| 0:09:59| is that they have a choice, 60-day suspension or $1,000 fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=599)|
| 0:10:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=602)|
| 0:10:03| Well, I'm not happy about giving you another chance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=603)|
| 0:10:07| because, as I said, this is the third incident.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=607)|
| 0:10:11| So I'm not happy about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=611)|
| 0:10:16| And, again, this excuse of misreading the dates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=616)|
| 0:10:20| or not doing the correct arithmetic is not an excuse that I'm willing to accept anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=620)|
| 0:10:25| So I hope that we don't see you here again, because if that's the case,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=625)|
| 0:10:29| I will make the motion that we suspend your license permanently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=629)|
| 0:10:33| Well, in his defense, in this case, by virtue of changing management,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=633)|
| 0:10:41| hopefully things are going to change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=641)|
| 0:10:44| So I think that my motion is a proper one in this case, and I'll call for the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=644)|
| 0:10:51| We have Mr. Smith's light on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=651)|
| 0:10:52| Can we go ahead and give him the courtesy of speaking?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=652)|
| 0:10:54| Just a quick question to Wolfie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=654)|
| 0:10:57| How many times is this the second or third time within how many months?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=657)|
| 0:11:01| You're saying it's the third time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=661)|
| 0:11:02| This is the third time since they've been open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=662)|
| 0:11:05| Which is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=665)|
| 0:11:07| I'm not sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=667)|
| 0:11:09| But it has not been within three years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=669)|
| 0:11:14| You know, I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=674)|
| 0:11:15| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=675)|
| 0:11:16| But it's over two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=676)|
| 0:11:17| It's two, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=677)|
| 0:11:19| They had one in December of last year, and then this one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=679)|
| 0:11:24| and we go back three years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=684)|
| 0:11:26| And so the first one, I believe, was further back than three years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=686)|
| 0:11:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=690)|
| 0:11:31| If I'm not mistaken, it may be like in 08.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=691)|
| 0:11:37| The motion on the floor is a $1,000 fine or 60-day suspension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=697)|
| 0:11:42| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=702)|
| 0:11:43| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=703)|
| 0:11:44| Any opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=704)|
| 0:11:46| Motion passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=706)|
| 0:11:47| Sir, I think you've gotten the sentiment of this beer board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=707)|
| 0:11:49| and so we hope that the reader works for you and that we don't see you again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=709)|
| 0:11:53| That would be a good thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=713)|
| 0:11:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=715)|
| 0:11:56| The fine, sir, would have to be paid within seven days to the county clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=716)|
| 0:12:01| Where are they located at?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=721)|
| 0:12:02| And I'll take that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=722)|
| 0:12:03| Those folks here can assist you with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=723)|
| 0:12:04| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=724)|
| 0:12:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=725)|

| 0:12:08| Applications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=728)|
| 0:12:09| El Catedral Mexican Grill, LLC, El Catedral Mexican Grill, 7240 Norris Freeway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=729)|
| 0:12:15| on premises formerly Happy Rooster Cafe, District 7.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=735)|
| 0:12:21| Mr. Law Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=741)|
| 0:12:22| It is my understanding, members of the commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=742)|
| 0:12:23| that there is a pending variance before the Board of Zoning Appeals on this case,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=743)|
| 0:12:29| and I think it would be premature to issue a beer license until such time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=749)|
| 0:12:33| to see whether or not they actually achieve that variance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=753)|
| 0:12:36| This may be one that would be best deferred,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=756)|
| 0:12:38| but I'll defer to the commission's wisdom on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=758)|
| 0:12:41| That motion is deferred.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=761)|
| 0:12:43| For 30 days or 60?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=763)|
| 0:12:44| How long?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=764)|
| 0:12:45| What's your suggestion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=765)|
| 0:12:47| Do we have a date on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=767)|
| 0:12:51| Is there a representative here of the?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=771)|
| 0:12:54| Yes, would you come to the podium, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=774)|
| 0:12:55| El Catedral?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=775)|
| 0:13:08| It was my understanding that this is still pending for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=788)|
| 0:13:12| I mean, it's a setback limitation that they're getting a variance for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=792)|
| 0:13:19| Who's going to speak for the business?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=799)|
| 0:13:21| I am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=801)|
| 0:13:22| Tell us your name, sir, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=802)|
| 0:13:24| Brian Munday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=804)|
| 0:13:25| Point of order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=805)|
| 0:13:26| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=806)|
| 0:13:27| The gentleman that's going to speak has not sworn in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=807)|
| 0:13:30| He came in afterwards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=810)|
| 0:13:32| Were you sworn in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=812)|
| 0:13:34| Please raise your right hand, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=814)|
| 0:13:36| Do you solemnly swear that the testimony you'll give here today is the truth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=816)|
| 0:13:38| the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=818)|
| 0:13:41| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=821)|
| 0:13:42| Now, please state your name for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=822)|
| 0:13:43| Brian Munday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=823)|
| 0:13:45| Sir, do you have an application for a variance on this property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=825)|
| 0:13:50| Let me ask him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=830)|
| 0:13:56| When is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=836)|
| 0:13:57| When do you go before the Board of Zoning Appeals?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=837)|
| 0:13:59| Do you have a date yet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=839)|
| 0:14:07| We understand it was for here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=847)|
| 0:14:09| When?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=849)|
| 0:14:10| What date?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=850)|
| 0:14:13| Monday, but that was canceled Monday, so we're coming today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=853)|
| 0:14:17| He's got the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=857)|
| 0:14:20| U.K.?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=860)|
| 0:14:22| They're checking right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=862)|
| 0:14:24| I don't think they've even applied for a variance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=864)|
| 0:14:27| They're checking with the office right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=867)|
| 0:14:30| Normally they would meet the Wednesday after we do, but this week, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=870)|
| 0:14:36| that's being canceled Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=876)|
| 0:14:37| It kind of screwed that up, too, so I think their meeting was canceled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=877)|
| 0:14:42| I don't know where it's been rescheduled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=882)|
| 0:14:43| It would probably be wise to move this to the January beer board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=883)|
| 0:14:46| No, they're coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=886)|
| 0:14:47| They canceled Monday?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=887)|
| 0:14:48| No, Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=888)|
| 0:14:50| And it is wise that we wait and see the action of the Board of Zoning Appeals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=890)|
| 0:14:55| because this past Wednesday there was an application for a variance on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=895)|
| 0:15:00| distance between the proposed site of beer sales and the nearby residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=900)|
| 0:15:10| or rural area or whatever, and the Board of Zoning Appeals denied that appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=910)|
| 0:15:18| Mr. Chairman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=918)|
| 0:15:19| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=919)|
| 0:15:20| They haven't applied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=920)|
| 0:15:21| They was just going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=921)|
| 0:15:24| They applied for a beer license, but they haven't applied for a variance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=924)|
| 0:15:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=929)|
| 0:15:30| Commissioner Smith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=930)|
| 0:15:31| Do we have a motion on the floor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=931)|
| 0:15:32| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=932)|
| 0:15:33| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=933)|
| 0:15:34| Let's make a motion to defer it to 60 days or unless they get that zoning earlier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=934)|
| 0:15:39| we can do it January time, but we're going to meet in January,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=939)|
| 0:15:42| then they'll probably meet the next week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=942)|
| 0:15:44| so it'll probably need to be February that we see it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=944)|
| 0:15:46| but just whenever they get that approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=946)|
| 0:15:49| Motion is to defer for 60 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=949)|
| 0:15:51| There is a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=951)|
| 0:15:52| Roy, did you have something to add?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=952)|
| 0:15:54| I just wanted to say that the BZA met in another matter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=954)|
| 0:15:58| and the vote was 7-0 to deny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=958)|
| 0:16:00| But it wasn't on this case?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=960)|
| 0:16:02| Not on this case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=962)|
| 0:16:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=963)|
| 0:16:04| What matter was that, Roy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=964)|
| 0:16:07| It was the one in Gibbs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=967)|
| 0:16:09| I think Commissioner Wright knows which one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=969)|
| 0:16:12| The occurrence of which I've only had one phone call was at Harbinson's Crossroads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=972)|
| 0:16:20| That's Emery Road at Tazewell Pike,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=980)|
| 0:16:22| and the request of the Board of Zoning Appeals was a variance in the setback from the residential line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=982)|
| 0:16:30| In this instance, it should be 500 feet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=990)|
| 0:16:34| and I believe the actual distance is only 170 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=994)|
| 0:16:40| The problem that I think that we, Knox County, is going to face is that in that same building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=1000)|
| 0:16:46| beer is already being served.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=1006)|
| 0:16:49| So the Board of Zoning Appeals, I'm not aware of what all they discussed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=1009)|
| 0:16:57| but the problem is going to be that there are several locations right there in the area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=1017)|
| 0:17:03| and in this particular building, of existing beer sales.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=1023)|
| 0:17:08| Mr. Chairman, I can help you all on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=1028)|
| 0:17:12| They are a beer, but they applied for beer on-premise, and all the beer around it is off-premise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=1032)|
| 0:17:22| You've got Waggles, Ken Joe, that sells beer off-premise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=1042)|
| 0:17:31| This particular place was planned for on-premise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=1051)|
| 0:17:36| Commissioner McKenzie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=1056)|
| 0:17:38| I'm just looking at the, I know we've kind of gotten off of their matter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=1058)|
| 0:17:42| but I'm looking at, that's why I seconded Commissioner Smith's 60-day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=1062)|
| 0:17:47| I'm looking at the BZA agenda, and I don't see anything on here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=1067)|
| 0:17:50| so it probably won't be seen until January, so I think 60 days would be appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=1070)|
| 0:17:56| The motion is to defer for 60 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=1076)|
| 0:17:58| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=1078)|
| 0:17:59| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=1079)|
| 0:18:00| Opposed, in opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=1080)|
| 0:18:01| It has been deferred for 60 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=1081)|
| 0:18:03| Mr. Munday, do you understand what needs to be done?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=1083)|
| 0:18:06| Can you explain to me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=1086)|
| 0:18:08| You need to apply before the Board of Zoning Appeals to get a variance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=1088)|
| 0:18:12| Your business is apparently zoned too close to agricultural or residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=1092)|
| 0:18:17| I'm not sure what it is, Mr. Brayden,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=1097)|
| 0:18:20| but you need to apply for a zoning variance before you can get a beer license for that location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=1100)|
| 0:18:25| That gentleman will help you to your right and my left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=1105)|

| 0:18:44| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=1124)|
| 0:18:45| Please come up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=1125)|
| 0:18:46| Same thing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=1126)|
| 0:18:46| Please put your hands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=1126)|
| 0:18:47| Sir, state your name for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=1127)|
| 0:18:58| Juan Caracas, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=1138)|
| 0:19:00| Did you apply for a variance on this property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=1140)|
| 0:19:05| Well, somebody picked it up before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=1145)|
| 0:19:07| but then never come and pick it up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=1147)|
| 0:19:09| the permits, the new owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=1149)|
| 0:19:13| The owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=1153)|
| 0:19:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=1155)|
| 0:19:16| So we have the same problem here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=1156)|
| 0:19:18| we had with the one before?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=1158)|
| 0:19:19| I think, I believe the previous owner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=1159)|
| 0:19:21| came before us a couple of months ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=1161)|
| 0:19:25| and tried to get a beer permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=1165)|
| 0:19:27| Has there been a beer permit issued here before?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=1167)|
| 0:19:29| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=1169)|
| 0:19:30| It was issued pending, but she never picked it up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=1170)|
| 0:19:34| and then sold the business before she did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=1174)|
| 0:19:37| Does the variance move with the owner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=1177)|
| 0:19:38| Nah, that's the question I want to research| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=1178)|
| 0:19:40| because there's a debate whether or not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=1180)|
| 0:19:42| it travels with the land or with the owner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=1182)|
| 0:19:44| and it's transferable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=1184)|
| 0:19:45| So this would likewise, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=1185)|
| 0:19:47| be prudent to continue this for 60 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=1187)|
| 0:19:50| Is there a motion to defer for 60 days?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=1190)|
| 0:19:53| And a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=1193)|
| 0:19:54| Commissioner Brown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=1194)|
| 0:20:00| Yes, Mr. Brayden, do you have anything?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=1200)|
| 0:20:01| Okay, Mr. Brayden can assist you again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=1201)|
| 0:20:03| We're going, the motion is to defer for six days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=1203)|
| 0:20:06| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=1206)|
| 0:20:07| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=1207)|
| 0:20:08| Opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=1208)|
| 0:20:09| Mr. Brayden can assist you as to what you need to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=1209)|
| 0:20:11| from this point on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=1211)|
| 0:20:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=1212)|
| 0:20:13| We'll defer for 60 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=1213)|
| 0:20:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=1214)|
| 0:20:16| Wolfie, you handed out a,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=1216)|
| 0:20:18| we have a couple of discussion items,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=1218)|
| 0:20:20| but did you want to discuss this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=1220)|
| 0:20:22| this handout that you gave us with regards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=1222)|
| 0:20:24| to the Regional Threat and Analysis Center?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=1224)|
| 0:20:27| No, that was just for y'all's info,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=1227)|
| 0:20:30| something that I wanted y'all to look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=1230)|
| 0:20:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=1233)|
| 0:20:34| Clerk, next item, we have a discussion item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=1234)|
| 0:20:36| Mr. Chairman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=1236)|
| 0:20:37| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=1237)|
| 0:20:38| In regards to the handout that Wolfie passed out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=1238)|
| 0:20:41| this has been discussed a couple times| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=1241)|
| 0:20:43| with the Metropolitan Drug Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=1243)|
| 0:20:46| They have contacted the local distributors here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=1246)|
| 0:20:49| That Four Loko is the equivalent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=1249)|
| 0:20:53| I mean, it's supposed to be an energy drink,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=1253)|
| 0:20:55| but if you mix caffeine and alcohol together,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=1255)|
| 0:20:57| one of those is equivalent to about three or four beers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=1257)|
| 0:21:02| Nationally, there are several states that have banned it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=1262)|
| 0:21:05| Tennessee has not done that yet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=1265)|
| 0:21:06| but they have contacted the local distributors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=1266)|
| 0:21:09| They've agreed to pull it off the shelves,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=1269)|
| 0:21:12| not distribute it locally, so it will take,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=1272)|
| 0:21:15| I don't know, it would take a request| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=1275)|
| 0:21:18| from this board to the state,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=1278)|
| 0:21:20| how we'd go about doing it there at the state level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=1280)|
| 0:21:24| Maybe Mr. Chairman could enlighten us on that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=1284)|
| 0:21:26| but it needs to be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=1286)|
| 0:21:29| If he would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=1289)|
| 0:21:30| The problem here is, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=1290)|
| 0:21:32| if you go into a convenience store today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=1292)|
| 0:21:34| the shelves are full of energy drinks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=1294)|
| 0:21:36| and if the clerk doesn't look| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=1296)|
| 0:21:40| at which one they're picking up there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=1300)|
| 0:21:41| and they pick this puppy up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=1301)|
| 0:21:43| it's also been used as a date rape drug.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=1303)|
| 0:21:47| So, I mean, it's that powerful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=1307)|
| 0:21:49| So this is something that needs to be taken off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=1309)|
| 0:21:53| The company that makes it has agreed to cut down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=1313)|
| 0:21:57| correct me if I'm wrong,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=1317)|
| 0:21:58| they've agreed to cut down the caffeine content.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=1318)|
| 0:22:02| Is that right, Karen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=1322)|
| 0:22:04| She can give you more idea about it than me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=1324)|
| 0:22:08| Thank you, I can go ahead and answer any questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=1328)|
| 0:22:10| you may have out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=1330)|
| 0:22:11| Can you give us your name and address| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=1331)|
| 0:22:12| for the record, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=1332)|
| 0:22:13| Yes, Karen Pershing, Executive Director| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=1333)|
| 0:22:15| of the Metropolitan Drug Commission, 4930 Lyons View Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=1335)|
| 0:22:20| We have been working on this For Loco Juice,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=1340)|
| 0:22:23| it's another product, J-O-O-S-E,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=1343)|
| 0:22:26| which is a caffeinated malt beverage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=1346)|
| 0:22:30| that's really packaged to appeal to under 21,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=1350)|
| 0:22:33| if you ever saw the packaging, very colorful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=1353)|
| 0:22:36| The FDA did ban these drinks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=1356)|
| 0:22:40| because of the caffeine content| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=1360)|
| 0:22:42| in conjunction with the alcohol content.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=1362)|
| 0:22:46| Basically, it was referred to as blackout in a can,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=1366)|
| 0:22:50| if that tells you anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=1370)|
| 0:22:52| Several states did ban the product from being sold,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=1372)|
| 0:22:56| but in the meantime, the FDA has worked out an agreement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=1376)|
| 0:22:59| with the producers of the beverage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=1379)|
| 0:23:01| to pull the beverage from being sold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=1381)|
| 0:23:06| They are in the process of reformulating,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=1386)|
| 0:23:09| taking the caffeine out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=1389)|
| 0:23:11| So these drinks will be back on the shelves| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=1391)|
| 0:23:14| in a new formula,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=1394)|
| 0:23:17| but we are gonna have to be extremely cautious| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=1397)|
| 0:23:21| that we monitor these beverages,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=1401)|
| 0:23:23| because like I said, they look just like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=1403)|
| 0:23:26| an energy drink without alcohol in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=1406)|
| 0:23:29| So unless people are educated on what to look for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=1409)|
| 0:23:34| and to make sure you ID for these,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=1414)|
| 0:23:37| and binge drinking is a huge issue among young folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=1417)|
| 0:23:42| And when you're talking about three to four servings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=1422)|
| 0:23:45| of beer in one can,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=1425)|
| 0:23:47| it's definitely a product that we wanna keep our eyes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=1427)|
| 0:23:50| peeled for and watch out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=1430)|
| 0:23:53| Could you prepare a resolution to bring to the body?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=1433)|
| 0:23:57| Perhaps Mr. Commissioner Brown could submit it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=1437)|
| 0:24:00| that we could send on to Nashville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=1440)|
| 0:24:03| expressing our concern over this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=1443)|
| 0:24:04| asking them to take a look at how Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=1444)|
| 0:24:07| should handle these types of drinks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=1447)|
| 0:24:09| Yes, I certainly can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=1449)|
| 0:24:10| Great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=1450)|
| 0:24:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=1451)|
| 0:24:12| Thank you, Karen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=1452)|
| 0:24:14| We have a discussion item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=1454)|
| 0:24:16| Discuss what action the commission deems appropriate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=1456)|
| 0:24:19| regarding dormant beer applications| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=1459)|
| 0:24:21| deferred from October 2010.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=1461)|
| 0:24:25| Mr. Law Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=1465)|
| 0:24:28| It's my understanding, members of the commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=1468)|
| 0:24:30| Mr. Chairman, that there are essentially applications made| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=1470)|
| 0:24:35| and then ultimately never acted upon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=1475)|
| 0:24:36| And the commission was trying to determine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=1476)|
| 0:24:39| what if anything could be done in that instance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=1479)|
| 0:24:41| One suggestion was perhaps a yearly maintenance fee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=1481)|
| 0:24:43| which the law wouldn't provide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=1483)|
| 0:24:45| The law would provide you to actually assess| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=1485)|
| 0:24:48| the annual privilege tax on those permits not acted upon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=1488)|
| 0:24:54| And just as a point of information,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=1494)|
| 0:24:56| what the city does, the city of Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=1496)|
| 0:24:59| is that they'll only hold that petition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=1499)|
| 0:25:01| or that permit open for 90 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=1501)|
| 0:25:03| And if after that time you want to act upon it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=1503)|
| 0:25:06| you've got to come back before the beer board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=1506)|
| 0:25:08| and ask for an extension of that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=1508)|
| 0:25:10| So my point is you do have some flexibility as to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=1510)|
| 0:25:13| if you do see it as a problem,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=1513)|
| 0:25:14| some remedial measures you can take,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=1514)|
| 0:25:17| which would necessitate a change in your ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=1517)|
| 0:25:19| which would mean an ordinance amendment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=1519)|
| 0:25:21| which is just ministerial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=1521)|
| 0:25:22| We can do that quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=1522)|
| 0:25:24| It's just a matter of how cumbersome and burdensome this is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=1524)|
| 0:25:27| and what action, if any, the commission wants to take.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=1527)|
| 0:25:29| Mr. Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=1529)|
| 0:25:30| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=1530)|
| 0:25:32| I'll give you my opinion on this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=1532)|
| 0:25:33| and I'll make a motion to that effect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=1533)|
| 0:25:37| Regardless of who comes up here and gets a beer permit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=1537)|
| 0:25:39| whether it's any one of these folks sitting out here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=1539)|
| 0:25:42| either one of us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=1542)|
| 0:25:44| once we get the permit issued,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=1544)|
| 0:25:47| there's nothing says you have to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=1547)|
| 0:25:49| or will sell so much beer if you've got that license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=1549)|
| 0:25:52| So they have a license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=1552)|
| 0:25:54| Once we've issued it, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=1554)|
| 0:25:58| They have their permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=1558)|
| 0:25:59| What he is referring to are the pending beer permits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=1559)|
| 0:26:02| those that have been approved pending| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=1562)|
| 0:26:05| health department, fire department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=1565)|
| 0:26:07| completion of construction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=1567)|
| 0:26:09| and not the ones that have already been issued.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=1569)|
| 0:26:13| That are not using.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=1573)|
| 0:26:14| These are ones that have not been picked up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=1574)|
| 0:26:17| Apparently the clerk is monitoring permits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=1577)|
| 0:26:19| that are years old.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=1579)|
| 0:26:20| We're pending usually construction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=1580)|
| 0:26:22| and that's where I first learned about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=1582)|
| 0:26:25| The county clerk informed me that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=1585)|
| 0:26:27| basically he was looking for some guidance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=1587)|
| 0:26:28| He goes, how many years do I have to monitor these?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=1588)|
| 0:26:31| Do I have to monitor them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=1591)|
| 0:26:32| How do I monitor them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=1592)|
| 0:26:33| That's the concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=1593)|
| 0:26:35| Well, some cases we have people like Weigold| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=1595)|
| 0:26:37| or some of the other ones that come in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=1597)|
| 0:26:38| that get four, five, three or four at a time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=1598)|
| 0:26:41| and they build one store at a time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=1601)|
| 0:26:43| but they get these licenses pending| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=1603)|
| 0:26:46| based on whatever degree of construction they're in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=1606)|
| 0:26:51| In that case, if we're having to keep up with the paperwork,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=1611)|
| 0:26:55| I don't think there should be some kind of fee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=1615)|
| 0:26:57| maintenance fee attached to that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=1617)|
| 0:26:59| until it comes to fruition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=1619)|
| 0:27:03| Well, what you'd want to actually do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=1623)|
| 0:27:04| is assess the annual privilege tax| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=1624)|
| 0:27:07| that everyone else has to pay that has a viable permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=1627)|
| 0:27:11| That's feasible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=1631)|
| 0:27:12| That's $100, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=1632)|
| 0:27:15| I believe it is, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=1635)|
| 0:27:16| If that's the case, I'll make that motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=1636)|
| 0:27:17| that these that are pending be-| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=1637)|
| 0:27:20| Certainly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=1640)|
| 0:27:22| $100 a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=1642)|
| 0:27:24| There's a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=1644)|
| 0:27:25| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=1645)|
| 0:27:26| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=1646)|
| 0:27:27| Commissioner Andrews?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=1647)|
| 0:27:28| I was just gonna kind of discuss it a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=1648)|
| 0:27:31| The reason that some of, and Mr. Weigold's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=1651)|
| 0:27:33| is obviously the biggest part of the list,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=1653)|
| 0:27:38| and he plans out many years ahead,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=1658)|
| 0:27:41| and if he can't get a permit for a site, he doesn't buy it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=1661)|
| 0:27:44| and it helps him in his development and his planning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=1664)|
| 0:27:48| and I think it makes sense,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=1668)|
| 0:27:51| and I think charging, he understands| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=1671)|
| 0:27:55| that there's a cost with that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=1675)|
| 0:27:56| and I think charging the privilege tax| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=1676)|
| 0:27:58| for that beer permit is a good idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=1678)|
| 0:28:01| I don't believe that we should cut him off| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=1681)|
| 0:28:03| after 90 days because if he gets it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=1683)|
| 0:28:06| if he, you know, that's short-term planning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=1686)|
| 0:28:09| in the convenience store business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=1689)|
| 0:28:11| I don't think you can do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=1691)|
| 0:28:12| so I think the privilege tax is the way to go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=1692)|
| 0:28:14| without cutting him off on time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=1694)|
| 0:28:16| Commissioner Wright?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=1696)|
| 0:28:17| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=1697)|
| 0:28:19| That was the point I was going to make also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=1699)|
| 0:28:20| I believe I remember within the last two years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=1700)|
| 0:28:22| we've had one beer permit requested| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=1702)|
| 0:28:26| that was approved pending,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=1706)|
| 0:28:28| and at that time, in that same motion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=1708)|
| 0:28:32| it was noted that the $100 charge would be ongoing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=1712)|
| 0:28:38| and if I remember correctly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=1718)|
| 0:28:41| So I think that this is a business planning cycle thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=1721)|
| 0:28:47| and if they're interested enough| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=1727)|
| 0:28:49| in keeping the beer permit active,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=1729)|
| 0:28:52| the $100 a year to cover our expense| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=1732)|
| 0:28:55| of keeping up with it is the same expense| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=1735)|
| 0:28:58| that we cover keeping up with the ones| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=1738)|
| 0:29:01| that are dispensing beer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=1741)|
| 0:29:03| Commissioner McKenzie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=1743)|
| 0:29:05| I guess this is more of a point of order,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=1745)|
| 0:29:07| and we're having a discussion item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=1747)|
| 0:29:10| Can a resolution or a voting item come out of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=1750)|
| 0:29:14| or do we need to do something more than that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=1754)|
| 0:29:18| Well, what the commission's going to do, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=1758)|
| 0:29:20| is if this goes through, is to direct me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=1760)|
| 0:29:22| to actually come back to you with an ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=1762)|
| 0:29:25| So it would have no legal effect today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=1765)|
| 0:29:27| until you actually amend your ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=1767)|
| 0:29:28| which will require two public readings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=1768)|
| 0:29:30| but it's a good point, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=1770)|
| 0:29:31| I see your point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=1771)|
| 0:29:32| Would you restate your motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=1772)|
| 0:29:34| You're requesting the law director to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=1774)|
| 0:29:36| Draw the resolution, change the ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=1776)|
| 0:29:38| to reflect that any of these pendings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=1778)|
| 0:29:40| will be assessed the $100 a year maintenance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=1780)|
| 0:29:43| And there has been a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=1783)|
| 0:29:44| Commissioner Wright?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=1784)|
| 0:29:46| And I want to soundly say I support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=1786)|
| 0:29:48| what Commissioner McKenzie has just said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=1788)|
| 0:29:50| I do not see this as an agenda item that's before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=1790)|
| 0:29:54| It's strictly a discussion item| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=1794)|
| 0:29:56| to come back to us in proper form.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=1796)|
| 0:29:59| Thank you for pointing that out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=1799)|
| 0:30:02| All in favor of this motion to request the law director| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=1802)|
| 0:30:04| to come back to us with a recommendation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=1804)|
| 0:30:07| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=1807)|
| 0:30:07| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=1807)|
| 0:30:08| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=1808)|
| 0:30:09| Any opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=1809)|
| 0:30:10| Any other business to come before the beer board?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=1810)|
| 0:30:12| I will remind commissioners this is our new day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=1812)|
| 0:30:15| on the new time frame.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=1815)|
| 0:30:16| We will come back into session in about 10 minutes or so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=1816)|
| 0:30:20| We will have our honorariums| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=1820)|
| 0:30:21| and we have three people signed up for public forum| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=1821)|
| 0:30:23| and then we begin the regular commission meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=1823)|
| 0:30:26| at two o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=1826)|
| 0:30:26| So 1.45 is our next time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=1826)|
| 0:30:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=1830)|

| 0:51:53| A couple of weeks ago I got a letter from Dan King, who is the field representative of the State Fire Marshal Fire Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=3113)|
| 0:52:01| commending, let me just read it to you here, very short,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=3121)|
| 0:52:05| whereas every year fire and other emergencies take thousands of lives and destroy property worth billions of dollars,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=3125)|
| 0:52:12| whereas firefighters help protect the public against above-referenced dangers by responsing to fires and a variety of other emergencies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=3132)|
| 0:52:18| and whereas finding fires is complex and dangerous and requires exemplary organization, teamwork,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=3138)|
| 0:52:24| and whereas Rural Metro firefighters, under the leadership of Chief Jerry Harnish, were recently commended, I can't even read today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=3144)|
| 0:52:32| by Dan King, field representative of the State Fire Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=3152)|
| 0:52:36| for their exemplary service both in the field and in the classroom as trainers on behalf of firefighters across the state of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=3156)|
| 0:52:43| Therefore, be it resolved that the Commission of Knox County hereby honors Chief Jerry Harnish| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=3163)|
| 0:52:49| and the firefighters under his command for consistently displaying exemplary professionalism| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=3169)|
| 0:52:55| and selfless devotion to the health, welfare, safety, and the citizens of Knox County and beyond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=3175)|
| 0:53:01| This was kind of brought to mind this week, too, in the inclement weather we've had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=3181)|
| 0:53:07| and some of the emergency situations that have come up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=3187)|
| 0:53:10| If any of you saw the little blurb on the news where they showed the shot of the 9-11 bank of phones,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=3190)|
| 0:53:18| did you see what some of those folks were wearing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=3198)|
| 0:53:21| They were wearing Rural Metro jackets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=3201)|
| 0:53:24| So it's not just we're honoring the fire department here today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=3204)|
| 0:53:28| but in Knox County I think we have the greatest police department, sheriff's department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=3208)|
| 0:53:34| and firefighters anywhere in the state of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=3214)|
| 0:53:37| So it's my pleasure today to present this to Chief Jerry Harnish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=3217)|
| 0:53:47| You know, you've got a good job when the job description comes taking credit for other people's work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=3227)|
| 0:53:53| And that's essentially what this is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=3233)|
| 0:53:56| I am very proud of the men and women that serve this community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=3236)|
| 0:54:00| and not only in the Division of Fire, but our counterparts in the Division of Emergency Medical Services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=3240)|
| 0:54:05| I'm frequently amazed at the quality of people that we're able to draw to this community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=3245)|
| 0:54:10| But then again, I think you'll agree it's a very special community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=3250)|
| 0:54:13| and we're able to attract people whose talents might otherwise go in service elsewhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=3253)|
| 0:54:19| But in any case, thank you very much for the recognition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=3259)|
| 0:54:22| I think folks will be very pleased to see it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=3262)|
| 0:54:26| And Chief, thank you very much for your work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=3266)|
| 0:54:28| Please convey to your employees the sincere thanks of the commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=3268)|
| 0:54:32| but also the citizens of Knox County, because as Commissioner Brown said during this inclement weather,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=3272)|
| 0:54:36| I know that you folks worked a lot of overtime and you performed admirably.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=3276)|
| 0:54:40| So please express that to them and our thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=3280)|
| 0:54:44| Commissioner Shouse, did you have something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=3284)|
| 0:54:46| I have a couple of verbal honorariums, if I may, if you were still in honorariums.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=3286)|
| 0:54:52| A couple of weeks ago I had the honor of representing commission at the Knoxville Symphony Orchestra.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=3292)|
| 0:54:57| A special concert, it wasn't very special, but it was a Thursday and a Friday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=3297)|
| 0:55:01| I think Mayor Burchett went Friday, but I went Thursday evening and read a proclamation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=3301)|
| 0:55:05| honoring them on the 75 years they've been in Knoxville and all they've done for our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=3305)|
| 0:55:11| And I just wanted to mention they reach over 200,000 people annually,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=3311)|
| 0:55:14| and 80% of their activities are out in the community at schools and hospitals and libraries,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=3314)|
| 0:55:19| and things of that nature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=3319)|
| 0:55:21| So congratulations to the Knoxville Symphony.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=3321)|
| 0:55:23| And secondly, a little over a week ago I was at the Museum of Art| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=3323)|
| 0:55:27| for the East Tennessee Regional Student Art Exhibit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=3327)|
| 0:55:30| and I was pleasantly surprised to see that Denae Stills, 12th grader at Hardin Valley Academy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=3330)|
| 0:55:38| won first place in 12th grade art and also had a piece that was given the best drawing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=3338)|
| 0:55:46| And Denae is the daughter of our office assistant upstairs, Drusilla Stills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=3346)|
| 0:55:52| So I just want to say congratulations to Denae.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=3352)|
| 0:55:54| That's certainly a great honor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=3354)|
| 0:55:55| It looks like she's got a lot of scholarship offers here, like eight or ten colleges, I assume,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=3355)|
| 0:56:00| want to give her a scholarship.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=3360)|
| 0:56:02| But if you get a chance, mention that to Drusilla.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=3362)|
| 0:56:04| She was certainly a proud mom that night, and I was happy to meet her daughter and look at the artwork.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=3364)|
| 0:56:10| That artwork will all be at the museum, about 300 pieces, for another month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=3370)|
| 0:56:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=3374)|
| 0:56:15| Great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=3375)|
| 0:56:16| Thank you for sharing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=3376)|
| 0:56:17| Now public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=3377)|
| 0:56:18| We have three people who have signed up for public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=3378)|
| 0:56:20| Roy Leith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=3380)|
| 0:56:21| Is Roy Leith here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=3381)|
| 0:56:22| Mr. Leith, if you would come forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=3382)|
| 0:56:24| You have three minutes to address us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=3384)|
| 0:56:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=3386)|
| 0:56:27| Thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=3387)|
| 0:56:28| Thank you, guys, for allowing an ordinary citizen to come out and speak a couple of concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=3388)|
| 0:56:32| I reside at 9020 Hillside Drive in Mascot, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=3392)|
| 0:56:35| And generally, you guys may hear a lot about our county roads| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=3395)|
| 0:56:42| and the conditions of them and things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=3402)|
| 0:56:44| I don't know how often that comes before you all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=3404)|
| 0:56:46| but specifically about a couple of places that is out in our neck of the woods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=3406)|
| 0:56:52| Loves Creek Road that runs in between Rutledge Pike and Millertown Pike,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=3412)|
| 0:56:59| around the Knoxville Center area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=3419)|
| 0:57:01| is probably one of the worst roads I've ever seen in all of my 45 years of living in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=3421)|
| 0:57:08| The other day I took the liberty to count from one end of that road to the other,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=3428)|
| 0:57:14| and there's at least 46 deficiencies in that road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=3434)|
| 0:57:19| albeit potholes, manhole covers that have sank to a level that it will just jar your teeth if you run over them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=3439)|
| 0:57:26| Not only that, but it's a very narrow road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=3446)|
| 0:57:28| There are no shoulders there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=3448)|
| 0:57:30| And we have people walking up and down through there all the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=3450)|
| 0:57:32| There's a public spring that people go there and get their water from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=3452)|
| 0:57:36| And so there's people walking up and down through there all the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=3456)|
| 0:57:39| So not only are you trying to dodge all these teeth-jattering potholes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=3459)|
| 0:57:43| but you're dodging people and other cars as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=3463)|
| 0:57:47| And as the East Town community has grown, there's so much more traffic on that area there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=3467)|
| 0:57:53| And if you drive down through there, you can tell where they have tried to fix this and fix that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=3473)|
| 0:57:59| And I don't ever see where turning a pothole into a bump really makes anything any better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=3479)|
| 0:58:04| But in all my years of living out there, I don't ever recall that road ever being paved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=3484)|
| 0:58:10| And so I would just love for the commission to maybe take a look at that right there, just for the safety of our cars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=3490)|
| 0:58:17| The wear and tear it's doing on our cars, for those of us who have to frequent that on a daily basis, is incredible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=3497)|
| 0:58:24| The other problem that we're experiencing up there is a stretch of road on Rutledge Pike in between Shop Town Road and Ellis Town Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=3504)|
| 0:58:32| It's on both sides. You literally, there's places we have to get over into the other lane and or the shoulder| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=3512)|
| 0:58:38| if we want to avoid this, you know, traumatic things that's going on in our vehicles if we run over those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=3518)|
| 0:58:44| And so, you know, that specifically, but in general, in my 45 years of living out in our East Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=3524)|
| 0:58:52| I can't ever remember seeing our roads in the shape that they are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=3532)|
| 0:58:55| And I run a route for a living, so I'm out in other areas of Knoxville as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=3535)|
| 0:59:00| West Knoxville, I mean, obviously you don't see any of this, or at least to this degree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=3540)|
| 0:59:05| And I would just wonder if there is any plans, if anybody is looking into this, into the conditions of these two specifically,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=3545)|
| 0:59:13| but also just in general of our East Knox County roads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=3553)|
| 0:59:16| I've never done anything like this before, so for me to come out and do this, I mean, it's very important to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=3556)|
| 0:59:22| And so I just wanted to come and share that with you guys today, and I thank you for that opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=3562)|
| 0:59:27| Well, first, let me thank you for doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=3567)|
| 0:59:29| And I appreciate the fact that you're here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=3569)|
| 0:59:31| Dwight Vandivate, would you raise your hand, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=3571)|
| 0:59:33| He's right back there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=3573)|
| 0:59:34| So when you're finished, Commissioner Briggs wants to ask you a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=3574)|
| 0:59:37| But if you would see Mr. Vandivate, he is our director that is over the roads and so forth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=3577)|
| 0:59:44| and he can point you in the right direction and talk with you about specifics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=3584)|
| 0:59:47| Commissioner Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=3587)|
| 0:59:48| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=3588)|
| 0:59:49| I think you took the words out of my mouth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=3589)|
| 0:59:51| I was going to ask you what the response had been from the engineering department when you had made the request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=3591)|
| 0:59:57| Well, they just said that they were going to look into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=3597)|
| 0:59:59| They looked to see if there was anything on the docket as far as Love's Creek Road specifically,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=3599)|
| 1:00:05| and they said that there was nothing on the docket as far as that goes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=3605)|
| 1:00:09| And, I mean, just that whole road itself is just separating in so many places, and it's really not safe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=3609)|
| 1:00:16| I mean, it's not safe for folks to be walking down through there, first of all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=3616)|
| 1:00:19| There's no shoulder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=3619)|
| 1:00:20| There's no sidewalk or anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=3620)|
| 1:00:23| It's just really getting hazardous to even drive on that road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=3623)|
| 1:00:26| So I will speak to Mr. Vandivate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=3626)|
| 1:00:29| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=3629)|
| 1:00:30| Mr. McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=3630)|
| 1:00:31| I traverse that road several times a week myself, and I agree with everything that you said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=3631)|
| 1:00:37| In fact, at last month's meeting, we did bring up Love's Creek as a concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=3637)|
| 1:00:44| Myself and a commissioner from the 8th District, that road has, you know, the traffic has increased back way to the Wal-Mart,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=3644)|
| 1:00:53| back way into the mall, as well as all the traffic that normally traverses that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=3653)|
| 1:00:59| And there's always someone there getting water.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=3659)|
| 1:01:01| You're absolutely right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=3661)|
| 1:01:02| So it is a concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=3662)|
| 1:01:04| I guess I question the response you got from the engineering department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=3664)|
| 1:01:11| I'm sure you got that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=3671)|
| 1:01:12| Because Commissioner Harmon at the time, Mark Harmon, two years ago, had voiced that as a concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=3672)|
| 1:01:21| And I think then engineering director was looking into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=3681)|
| 1:01:24| So I'll encourage you to see Mr. Vandivate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=3684)|
| 1:01:28| I will say this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=3688)|
| 1:01:29| At one particular point, I think I'd made two calls concerning this particular road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=3689)|
| 1:01:35| And the first time I called was probably back in August and where there was, I mean, there was a pothole that was that deep, if it was an inch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=3695)|
| 1:01:43| And probably a couple of weeks later, maybe three, I think that we'd shown where that had been paved over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=3703)|
| 1:01:49| But even since then, that particular pothole was starting to crack.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=3709)|
| 1:01:53| I know the brine mixture that's being put on our roads now is having a lot to do with this, I'm certain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=3713)|
| 1:02:01| So, I mean, you just look around on our end of the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=3721)|
| 1:02:05| There's just not a whole lot of paving going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=3725)|
| 1:02:07| There's a lot of patchwork here and there, but just not a lot of repairing our roads from point A to point B, if you know what I mean.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=3727)|
| 1:02:13| We'll ask Mr. Vandivate to report back to us in 30 days after you've had your conversation with him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=3733)|
| 1:02:18| Again, thank you for coming and addressing us here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=3738)|
| 1:02:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=3740)|
| 1:02:21| Next, we have Sergeant Isham Mullins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=3741)|
| 1:02:26| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=3746)|
| 1:02:29| Good afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=3749)|
| 1:02:32| I met Mr. Joseph Jarrett at the last NMAC meeting, and basically, well, I'm going to introduce myself first of all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=3752)|
| 1:02:39| My name is Staff Sergeant Mullins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=3759)|
| 1:02:40| I'm an Army recruiter, and I've been deployed all over the world.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=3760)|
| 1:02:43| But today I'm in a capacity as an Army recruiter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=3763)|
| 1:02:46| Basically what I want to do, I'm trying to promote March to Success.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=3766)|
| 1:02:50| And what March to Success is, is a free SAT, an SAT preparation site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=3770)|
| 1:02:55| And I've been trying to go to all the high schools I possibly can and get in touch with all the administrators I possibly could to put this site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=3775)|
| 1:03:02| It's a completely free site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=3782)|
| 1:03:04| And most parents that I talk to in PTA meetings kind of shy away from this, thinking that it's a recruitment tool, and it is not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=3784)|
| 1:03:11| Basically what happens is you log on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=3791)|
| 1:03:14| You have to log your child on, and you are the administrator.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=3794)|
| 1:03:17| And you can basically watch your child's progress.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=3797)|
| 1:03:23| And you're the only one that can go on and access your child's progress and see what they're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=3803)|
| 1:03:27| And we also have a video game site as far as like math, Algebra 1, Algebra 2, pre-calculus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=3807)|
| 1:03:32| And also this site encompasses our Army scholarships, ROTC scholarships.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=3812)|
| 1:03:38| So basically what I'm here today is basically I'm trying to promote this free site, which was developed by Kaplan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=3818)|
| 1:03:44| and trying to bring some notoriety to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=3824)|
| 1:03:46| It's a completely, like I say, free site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=3826)|
| 1:03:48| And it's trying to give our children basically some more asset, another asset to help them succeed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=3828)|
| 1:03:55| Can you give us that website again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=3835)|
| 1:03:57| It's www.march2success.com.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=3837)|
| 1:04:08| And I have instructions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=3848)|
| 1:04:10| And basically it leads you to armyed.com and lets you know about ROTC scholarships| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=3850)|
| 1:04:15| and lets you know about reserve scholarships.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=3855)|
| 1:04:17| And basically it also gives them planning tools, not just say SAT and ACT prep site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=3857)|
| 1:04:24| It also gives them planning tools and learning tools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=3864)|
| 1:04:26| And like I said, it's a direct monitor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=3866)|
| 1:04:28| You can monitor your child or your children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=3868)|
| 1:04:30| And also as a teacher, you can log on your whole classroom and monitor your whole class at one time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=3870)|
| 1:04:36| And it's completely free.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=3876)|
| 1:04:38| Like I said, I have these prepared pamphlets to pass out also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=3878)|
| 1:04:42| Yes, if you would do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=3882)|
| 1:04:43| Also, Mr. Russ Oaks is here, who is the chief of staff of the schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=3883)|
| 1:04:46| I'm sure he would appreciate a copy as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=3886)|
| 1:04:48| So would you raise your hand again, Russ, so he knows who you are, if you would see him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=3888)|
| 1:04:51| But, sir, thank you for your service to our country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=3891)|
| 1:04:53| And thank you for appearing here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=3893)|
| 1:04:55| And thank you for the interest in young people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=3895)|
| 1:04:57| And so anything else we can do to help, please don't hesitate to ask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=3897)|
| 1:05:00| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=3900)|
| 1:05:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=3901)|
| 1:05:02| Next we have Carol, is it, Rousseau?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=3902)|
| 1:05:06| If you would come forward, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=3906)|
| 1:05:09| If you would give your name and address for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=3909)|
| 1:05:11| Carol Rousseau, 7507 Hunters Ridge Way, 37914.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=3911)|
| 1:05:17| Mr. Chair, thank you for allowing me the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=3917)|
| 1:05:21| On November 3rd, I addressed the school board on this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=3921)|
| 1:05:25| And to date, I have not heard one member of the school board reply to me in a negative or positive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=3925)|
| 1:05:31| That is why I'm here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=3931)|
| 1:05:34| The best advice a lawyer gives their clients, do not respond to anything in writing and don't talk to the complainant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=3934)|
| 1:05:42| Anything you say or write can be held against you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=3942)|
| 1:05:46| I stand before you because everything I say and write is the truth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=3946)|
| 1:05:53| So help me God.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=3953)|
| 1:05:55| I asked a congressman, how can Congress pass a law knowing it is unconstitutional?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=3955)|
| 1:06:01| He replied, Congress can pass any law it wants, even if they know it is illegal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=3961)|
| 1:06:07| It is up to the courts to make that finding, if they choose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=3967)|
| 1:06:13| I was shocked to hear the truth concerning our Congress.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=3973)|
| 1:06:17| Now I believe it is how all government bodies function in America today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=3977)|
| 1:06:24| The school board should have known that a contract was made among the board, human resources and the classified personnel when they were hired.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=3984)|
| 1:06:33| I hold in my hand a copy of that agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=3993)|
| 1:06:36| Educational assistance salary schedule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=3996)|
| 1:06:39| The step increases are entitled to the educational assistance each year they remain with the school system and they cap out at step 14.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=3999)|
| 1:06:50| This agreement is not tied to pay raises.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=4010)|
| 1:06:53| The issue before you is not about pay raises.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=4013)|
| 1:06:56| It is about a contractual step, increased promise to your educational assistance when they were hired.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=4016)|
| 1:07:03| If you think I'm one person crying about not getting a step increase, you are wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=4023)|
| 1:07:10| I receive a military retirement check every month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=4030)|
| 1:07:14| I am fighting for justice, which I fought for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=4034)|
| 1:07:18| I am fighting right versus wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=4038)|
| 1:07:21| I grew up in the days when a person's word was golden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=4041)|
| 1:07:25| People do not verbally agree on anything and later deny that that agreement was ever reached.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=4045)|
| 1:07:32| Sadly, those days are gone and the days of honesty and truth have also passed away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=4052)|
| 1:07:40| It is obvious from the actions of the Knox County School Board, the money taken away from the educational assistance and other classified personnel are being used on other agendas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=4060)|
| 1:07:50| Contracts can be made and broken with no repercussions and no accountability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=4070)|
| 1:07:55| Yet another paper I hold in my hand, unscheduled in-service hours is strictly enforced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=4075)|
| 1:08:04| Non-certified personnel who work less than 12-month contracts are required to complete 24 hours of unscheduled in-service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=4084)|
| 1:08:13| This is 24 hours after school hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=4093)|
| 1:08:17| If an employee breaks that contractual agreement by missing hours, their pay is docked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=4097)|
| 1:08:23| They suffer the consequences.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=4103)|
| 1:08:26| However, when the school board breaks a contractual agreement, as in this case, again, who suffers the consequences?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=4106)|
| 1:08:34| The employees with no apparent recourse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=4114)|
| 1:08:37| They have their pay taken away and no one seems to care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=4117)|
| 1:08:41| Thanks to Knox News Sentinel, a thought, quote from John F. Kennedy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=4121)|
| 1:08:48| As we express our gratitude, we must never forget that the highest appreciation is not to utter words, but to live by them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=4128)|
| 1:08:59| I urge this board to find the money taken away from the classified employees and direct the school board to honor their contracts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=4139)|
| 1:09:08| Another quote from Knox News Sentinel, Jeff Ashland, President and CEO of Mercy Health Partners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=4148)|
| 1:09:16| As health care organizations, we want to set the proper example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=4156)|
| 1:09:21| I am pleading with you to set the proper example of a government body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=4161)|
| 1:09:28| Restore the money improperly taken away from your classified employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=4168)|
| 1:09:33| When the school board presented their budget to you, you may not have known about this step increase agreement and promise of salary schedule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=4173)|
| 1:09:41| You are made aware of it now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=4181)|
| 1:09:44| You may ask why I didn't protest during the budget hearings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=4184)|
| 1:09:47| No one ever thought that a board would break an agreement among their employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=4187)|
| 1:09:52| We are believers now and I can assure you we will be very active in the next school budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=4192)|
| 1:09:58| We will be there with legitimate ideas on ways to make the school system more efficient and effective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=4198)|
| 1:10:04| I am already getting phone calls at home and I promise you we will be ready.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=4204)|
| 1:10:09| I have a dream that one day very soon the school system will not need unions or lawyers to serve the great community of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=4209)|
| 1:10:18| We will be able to openly communicate among each other without fear of retribution for the greater good of all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=4218)|
| 1:10:25| For you see, the overwhelming majority of your employees are dedicated to their profession and should be respected in their employee capacity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=4225)|
| 1:10:35| Despite administrative belief that classified employees are a dime a dozen and expendable, let me assure you they are not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=4235)|
| 1:10:45| Unless, of course, educating your physically and intellectually challenged students require less quality than STEM students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=4245)|
| 1:10:56| Don't you believe it for one second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=4256)|
| 1:11:00| Please set things right. Correct a wrong without lawyers, labor department, or the courts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=4260)|
| 1:11:07| You have the power. I respectfully request you find the moral right to correct the wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=4267)|
| 1:11:15| I taught a class this semester entitled Unlock the Hawk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=4275)|
| 1:11:20| I told the students that they had to have dreams, have a plan, and even if they fail 1,000 times to try again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=4280)|
| 1:11:29| I cannot teach one thing and do another.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=4289)|
| 1:11:33| Your young men and women see too much deceit, hear too many lies, and watch leaders urge them to do what is right while the leaders themselves do the opposite.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=4293)|
| 1:11:45| We no longer lead by example, nor can we be trusted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=4305)|
| 1:11:50| I will not lie to my students, your children, or your grandchildren.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=4310)|
| 1:11:56| If you fail me tonight, I will get back up and pursue this to the next level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=4316)|
| 1:12:04| If I fail again, I promise you I will get back up and continue my quest until the wrong has been made right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=4324)|
| 1:12:13| It's not about me. It's about your employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=4333)|
| 1:12:18| They must understand someone cares about them. Someone appreciates and understands all they go through, day after day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=4338)|
| 1:12:28| That someone is me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=4348)|
| 1:12:31| I hope you show them that you also care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=4351)|
| 1:12:36| By restoring what was taken away from them, I'll give each member a copy of this message, as well as all copies of what has occurred up to this point in time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=4356)|
| 1:12:49| As with the school board, I respectfully requested an answer within 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=4369)|
| 1:12:55| You either agree that an error was made and you will correct it, or you will deny that an error was made and stand by that decision and not allow the contract to be enforced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=4375)|
| 1:13:06| Or you can follow the steps of the school board, not reply at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=4386)|
| 1:13:12| The three choices I leave in your hands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=4392)|
| 1:13:15| I do thank you for your time and for listening to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=4395)|

| 1:14:18| If he comes, if his dad will come to the podium, too, real quick, I want to ask Jeff Egan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=4458)|
| 1:14:23| Graylon is a student at Halls Middle School, and his daddy, Jeff, is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=4463)|
| 1:14:31| Graylon has, and I'll pass this out, Graylon has wrote a song on homelessness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=4471)|
| 1:14:36| And we've talked about homelessness, and it's a hot topic in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=4476)|
| 1:14:39| And, Jeff, I want you to just real quick tell some of the awards and things that Graylon has done, has already received.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=4479)|
| 1:14:47| First of all, I want to thank the commission for having us here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=4487)|
| 1:14:49| It's an honor for Graylon to be able to perform this song in front of you guys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=4489)|
| 1:14:54| Graylon has been singing since about the age of five years old.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=4494)|
| 1:14:58| And over the years, more importantly than any awards or accolades that he's gotten,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=4498)|
| 1:15:04| which he's gotten several over the years, is to be able to go to nursing homes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=4504)|
| 1:15:08| and be able to go to shelters and be able to go to churches| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=4508)|
| 1:15:14| and be able to perform and show the passion that he has in music.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=4514)|
| 1:15:19| And the song that he wrote is one that, like he said, he is the voice of, wants to be the voice of the homeless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=4519)|
| 1:15:27| And with the lyrics of this song, as it ends, the bottom line is we are all the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=4527)|
| 1:15:32| And so Graylon will show you what he can do with this song.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=4532)|
| 1:15:37| And, again, thank you guys for having us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=4537)|
| 1:15:41| As he finishes, I have Ritchie Tumlin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=4541)|
| 1:15:44| Ritchie, if you'll go ahead and come to the podium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=4544)|
| 1:15:46| And Ritchie's going to give us a prayer after Graylon finishes singing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=4546)|
| 1:15:50| And Ritchie is another really special individual that we have in the 7th District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=4550)|
| 1:15:55| A lot of you may know Ritchie Tumlin, but when he gives his prayer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=4555)|
| 1:15:59| you'll understand why we also think that Ritchie's also special to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=4559)|
| 1:16:03| So, Graylon, go ahead, son.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=4563)|
| 1:16:11| Under this bridge is my only hope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=4571)|
| 1:16:25| A little spin changes my life, my soul.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=4585)|
| 1:16:32| The walls make me crazy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=4592)|
| 1:16:36| That's why I'm lost and all alone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=4596)|
| 1:16:43| And the thing I've been told is I'll be here as I go on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=4603)|
| 1:16:52| My faith is stronger, and that's why I'm living.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=4612)|
| 1:17:00| But nothing has been said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=4620)|
| 1:17:08| Out here, I'm just a number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=4628)|
| 1:17:14| A bonesuit in a shelter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=4634)|
| 1:17:20| Just me can't let anybody down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=4640)|
| 1:17:25| And the thing I've been told is I'll be here as I go on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=4645)|
| 1:17:33| My faith is stronger, and that's why I'm living.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=4653)|
| 1:17:42| But nothing has been said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=4662)|
| 1:17:50| All tomorrow's gonna break.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=4670)|
| 1:17:55| It could be sunshine, it could be rain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=4675)|
| 1:18:02| All I know is that I'm gonna get there someday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=4682)|
| 1:18:11| Regardless, I'm gonna get there someday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=4691)|
| 1:18:17| All I know is that I'm gonna get there someday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=4697)|
| 1:18:32| All I know is that I'm gonna get there someday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=4712)|
| 1:18:40| All I know is that I'm gonna get there someday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=4720)|
| 1:18:43| Thank you guys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=4723)|
| 1:18:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=4725)|
| 1:18:50| Mr. Chairman, while Richie's coming, I just want to let you know that Graydon will be at Cotton Eye Joy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=4730)|
| 1:18:55| Is it Tuesday night?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=4735)|
| 1:18:56| Is it Monday night?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=4736)|
| 1:18:59| Was it last night?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=4739)|
| 1:19:00| There's no schedule, I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=4740)|
| 1:19:02| That's my commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=4742)|
| 1:19:06| All right, Richie, if you'll sing for us now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=4746)|
| 1:19:11| I'm old.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=4751)|
| 1:19:12| That's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=4752)|
| 1:19:13| I started thinking about the numbers that just came to my mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=4753)|
| 1:19:17| In 1948, we had 39 members of the Norfolk County Court of Appeals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=4757)|
| 1:19:25| Then it came along that we had a county judge and three administrative commissions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=4765)|
| 1:19:32| Welfare, highway, and financial services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=4772)|
| 1:19:38| Then, in 1955, the county court passed a budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=4778)|
| 1:19:45| Then, the same day, they rescheduled the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=4785)|
| 1:19:49| So, here's the county was with no budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=4789)|
| 1:19:52| Well, the county judge and the three administrative commissions were too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=4792)|
| 1:19:58| Mr. Chairman, that was just to say, hey, county court, you just ought to pass whatever budget they give you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=4798)|
| 1:20:05| So, you're the head of the line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=4805)|
| 1:20:07| Then came 1980, and they started what we have now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=4807)|
| 1:20:12| We reorganized our government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=4812)|
| 1:20:17| And we had, what, 19 commissioners?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=4817)|
| 1:20:21| Now we've got 11 commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=4821)|
| 1:20:24| We went back to the three commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=4824)|
| 1:20:30| Get nervous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=4830)|
| 1:20:32| Oh, you admit we're going backwards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=4832)|
| 1:20:34| We're going backwards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=4834)|
| 1:20:37| Let's talk about history.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=4837)|
| 1:20:39| Let's talk about it just a moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=4839)|
| 1:20:41| About how great it is to be in this position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=4841)|
| 1:20:44| But, you know, I am so proud of my county judge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=4844)|
| 1:20:49| You know, I am so happy to be a resident of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=4849)|
| 1:20:54| I have weeks of experience representing the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=4854)|
| 1:20:58| And I'm ashamed of the same old woman I would like to call an old woman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=4858)|
| 1:21:02| Because I think they are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=4862)|
| 1:21:04| You know, they don't know me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=4864)|
| 1:21:06| I don't know all of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=4866)|
| 1:21:08| They're doing things that they're supposed to be doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=4868)|
| 1:21:11| But I do believe that they are trying to please me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=4871)|
| 1:21:16| They are pleasing me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=4876)|
| 1:21:18| More than anyone in this county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=4878)|
| 1:21:20| I have to be responsible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=4880)|
| 1:21:22| I have to make trust with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=4882)|
| 1:21:25| You don't have to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=4885)|
| 1:21:27| Listen, they don't have to be the decision-makers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=4887)|
| 1:21:31| They don't have to be the decision-makers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=4891)|
| 1:21:33| They can make decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=4893)|
| 1:21:35| And that's what they have to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=4895)|
| 1:21:37| And that's what we have to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=4897)|
| 1:21:40| Blessing in this government that we're in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=4900)|
| 1:21:42| Thank you, God, to the homeless young that we just heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=4902)|
| 1:21:45| From United Way that's now had to extend their standpoint to folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=4905)|
| 1:21:49| We just historically make a vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=4909)|
| 1:21:52| And that's what we have to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=4912)|
| 1:21:54| Thank you, United Way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=4914)|
| 1:21:57| Help pay the tax relief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=4917)|
| 1:21:59| As I read the laws.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=4919)|
| 1:22:01| It's been 30 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=4921)|
| 1:22:03| People's hearts are not open enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=4923)|
| 1:22:07| The pocketbook is not big enough for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=4927)|
| 1:22:10| It's not even what I have paid for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=4930)|
| 1:22:13| So, if you can help folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=4933)|
| 1:22:15| I'm willing to pay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=4935)|

| 1:22:41| And the pledge to the flag.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=4961)|

| 1:22:53| And to the republic for which it stands, one nation under God,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=4973)|
| 1:22:57| indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=4977)|
| 1:23:05| Next on our agenda is the approval of minutes of the previous meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=4985)|
| 1:23:07| Is there a motion to approve?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=4987)|
| 1:23:08| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=4988)|
| 1:23:09| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=4989)|

| 1:23:13| Motion passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=4993)|
| 1:23:14| Are there any amendments to the agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=4994)|
| 1:23:17| Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=4997)|
| 1:23:19| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=4999)|
| 1:23:20| I don't want to put there's an item that someone had a question to me in the public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=5000)|
| 1:23:24| and I didn't have an opportunity to get back with him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=5004)|
| 1:23:26| It's on consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=5006)|
| 1:23:28| It's dealing with the parks and the resolution to deed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=5008)|
| 1:23:33| I don't know exactly what item number it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=5013)|
| 1:23:35| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=5015)|
| 1:23:38| It's about the Halls Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=5018)|
| 1:23:39| The issue we talked about legalities of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=5019)|
| 1:23:41| And to give an explanation, they didn't feel like they felt like it was illegal to have the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=5021)|
| 1:23:48| two items were illegal and we shouldn't have it on consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=5028)|
| 1:23:51| I don't want to pull it off consent because I still believe we're correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=5031)|
| 1:23:53| I have done some research, checked with the law department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=5033)|
| 1:23:57| We are somewhat indemnifying ourselves, but I don't believe the risk is there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=5037)|
| 1:24:03| And it's not illegal is a what she was referring to was an opinion by a Tennessee Attorney General| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=5043)|
| 1:24:08| and not a codified law or a court decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=5048)|
| 1:24:10| So I just wanted to make that clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=5050)|
| 1:24:12| I want to leave it on the consent agenda, but just wanted to give that explanation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=5052)|
| 1:24:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=5056)|

| 1:30:14| let us know. Do I hear a motion to approve the consent items?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=5414)|
| 1:30:19| Is there a second? All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=5419)|

| 1:30:59| Is there a second? Motion has been made and seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=5459)|
| 1:31:02| Mr. Rosenberg, your name and address, please, for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=5462)|
| 1:31:05| Grant Rosenberg, Knox County Community Development, 400 Main Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=5465)|
| 1:31:09| I'm here. Our department was made aware of this contract| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=5469)|
| 1:31:14| back in the spring. This was an agreement that was entered. It was a pilot agreement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=5474)|
| 1:31:18| between the Shumpert Administration and the County Commission at the time and St. Mary's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=5478)|
| 1:31:25| back in 1998. And I have Mary DeMoy here from Catholic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=5485)|
| 1:31:29| Health Partners. She came into town from Cincinnati and she's here to speak on behalf| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=5489)|
| 1:31:34| of this resolution. We put it on the agenda as a courtesy to Mercy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=5494)|
| 1:31:38| and let Mary take over the floor. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=5498)|
| 1:31:43| And if you could give us your name and address for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=5503)|
| 1:31:46| Yes, my name is Mary DeMoy. I reside in Cincinnati, Ohio.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=5506)|
| 1:31:50| I'm here as the treasurer of these three organizations and speaking on their behalf.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=5510)|
| 1:31:55| I wanted to give the Commission a little background on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=5515)|
| 1:32:00| I'm sure this is probably not something the Commission is very familiar with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=5520)|
| 1:32:05| So I thought a little history might help. I know it was helpful when I went through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=5525)|
| 1:32:08| this to discover what the background was and what the context was in making this request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=5528)|
| 1:32:16| These three properties were developed during 1999 through 2002 to serve the low-income| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=5536)|
| 1:32:22| elderly. The pilot funds were set up to provide the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=5542)|
| 1:32:29| flexibility that another HUD grant might be available to convert one wing of each| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=5549)|
| 1:32:35| of those housing properties to an assisted living setup with nursing support and things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=5555)|
| 1:32:43| of that nature as the residents continued to age and might need more services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=5563)|
| 1:32:48| To this point, we have not had enough residents meet that criteria or have those needs, so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=5568)|
| 1:32:55| we have not needed to apply for that HUD grant. In the meantime, some of those funds have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=5575)|
| 1:33:04| been set aside, but what we discovered was that as the budgets were submitted to HUD| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=5584)|
| 1:33:09| in those first years of operations, that the shelter rent payments that we were obligated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=5589)|
| 1:33:17| for were not included in the budget when the rent was set.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=5597)|
| 1:33:21| And so the funds were not available for the properties in those first few years to start| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=5601)|
| 1:33:26| making those deposits to the escrow accounts that they should have been making under those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=5606)|
| 1:33:30| shelter rent agreements. The basic way that HUD works is their goal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=5610)|
| 1:33:35| is for the properties to be break-even to marginally profitable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=5615)|
| 1:33:39| So if the money was not in the budget, there really are no funds available for the properties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=5619)|
| 1:33:45| to set aside into those escrow accounts. Once we discovered this and understood our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=5625)|
| 1:33:52| obligation, we started putting that shelter rent obligation into the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=5632)|
| 1:33:57| HUD did include that in the rent, and we have started making those deposits to the shelter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=5637)|
| 1:34:01| rent accounts. Part of that brings up the second request| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=5641)|
| 1:34:06| that we would have. One is for the waiver of those amounts prior| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=5646)|
| 1:34:10| to when the shelter rent expenses were put into the budgets for HUD.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=5650)|
| 1:34:16| And then we would like to work with the county in setting up some understanding of how we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=5656)|
| 1:34:21| might use those funds since we have not needed to make the whole-scale conversion that was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=5661)|
| 1:34:25| originally anticipated. We think we can be using those to help other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=5665)|
| 1:34:31| types of services for these residents to age in place since we haven't met that critical| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=5671)|
| 1:34:37| mass of having to convert a whole wing to an assisted living facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=5677)|
| 1:34:44| I would welcome questions, and hopefully I can provide you with any other background| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=5684)|
| 1:34:48| you need. Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=5688)|
| 1:34:50| Thank you, Ms. Chair. I'm confused as to how the what the mechanics are associated with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=5690)|
| 1:34:56| this, so I'll apologize up front for that. But I guess to my understanding, you all are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=5696)|
| 1:35:02| not paying taxes on this. That this, from the period in question, you all did not pay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=5702)|
| 1:35:11| any taxes to Knott's County, per your agreement with Mayor Schumpeter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=5711)|
| 1:35:16| That's correct, because under the agreement that was in place, there were no taxes to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=5716)|
| 1:35:20| be paid. The deposits were to be made to this other escrow account.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=5720)|
| 1:35:24| Right, okay. So this, but there were some indebtedness understood at the time of agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=5724)|
| 1:35:31| You all just...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=5731)|
| 1:35:32| Yes, there was a commitment there. The mechanics just didn't get put into place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=5732)|
| 1:35:37| So I guess if I compare that to another, you know, HUD-type facility, the KCDCU Funds and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=5737)|
| 1:35:42| Finance, there's, I mean, if it's a Section 8 property, they pay taxes, because that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=5742)|
| 1:35:49| their agreement, right? And so, and then my second question is, during this time period,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=5749)|
| 1:35:55| well, up to this date, from the time you signed your contract, I'm assuming that you all haven't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=5755)|
| 1:36:00| lost money associated with this, because you're still in the business, you know, a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=5760)|
| 1:36:05| decade later. So it's not, it's a profitable type of operation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=5765)|
| 1:36:14| It's not meant to make a profit. We, as a charitable organization, try to provide for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=5774)|
| 1:36:18| needs in the community. HUD's mechanism is such that if you make profits over a level| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=5778)|
| 1:36:25| that they feel is appropriate, you actually have to set those funds aside in a different| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=5785)|
| 1:36:29| kind of account. So the goal is not to make a lot of money on the profit. If you do make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=5789)|
| 1:36:33| profits, they are rolled back into the facilities. So on the flip side, if you are, have significant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=5793)|
| 1:36:40| losses, they want to make sure that they figure out operationally how to make that property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=5800)|
| 1:36:45| successful, because we both want to serve a certain portion of the residents in this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=5805)|
| 1:36:49| county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=5809)|
| 1:36:50| Okay, so for these three facilities, did you roll money back, or did HUD have to give you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=5810)|
| 1:36:54| additional money?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=5814)|
| 1:36:56| For the period that before we started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=5816)|
| 1:36:59| Since 95, I guess it's 95.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=5819)|
| 1:37:01| From 95 through 2005, HUD has not and will not go back and give us funds, additional| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=5821)|
| 1:37:06| funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=5826)|
| 1:37:06| No, I'm not talking about that. Okay, I'm saying since inception, have you all taken| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=5826)|
| 1:37:12| additional monies from HUD because you have not made money, or has HUD had to come back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=5832)|
| 1:37:16| in and look at you, or have you all made money to where you had to reinvest that per your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=5836)|
| 1:37:21| non-profit tax status? Which side of the equation are you all on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=5841)|
| 1:37:26| I'm trying to get a feel for if you're in the red or if you're in the black. I understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=5846)|
| 1:37:29| it's complicated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=5849)|
| 1:37:31| For these three properties, we have had losses historically from the time they have opened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=5851)|
| 1:37:36| There may have been some years that were positive, but in the total of time that they have been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=5856)|
| 1:37:40| opened, all three of them have been a net loss position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=5860)|
| 1:37:44| Okay, but you said you hadn't been able to, you hadn't added additional, and so let me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=5864)|
| 1:37:51| I'm trying to shift gears here, so you've, this 10% was supposed to go into a fund that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=5871)|
| 1:38:00| would help indigent care or more?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=5880)|
| 1:38:05| It would be specific things to help the elder. These housing projects are only for the elderly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=5885)|
| 1:38:11| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=5891)|
| 1:38:12| And as they get older, there may be other services, or we may need to add grab bars,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=5892)|
| 1:38:18| do things like that, maybe make doorways a little bit wider to accommodate wheelchairs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=5898)|
| 1:38:24| things like that that could mean they could stay in our housing property, but they may| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=5904)|
| 1:38:31| not be covered by HUD in terms of making those improvements or maybe finding additional services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=5911)|
| 1:38:36| Do they need someone to look in on them once a week and do their laundry? There may be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=5916)|
| 1:38:40| other things that would help them remain independent, and those are the types of things that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=5920)|
| 1:38:46| would hope that these funds could be used for if we don't need to do these whole-scale| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=5926)|
| 1:38:49| changes to the assisted living.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=5929)|
| 1:38:54| Just to be honest, I take a little bit of issue with us, you know, with we've had to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=5934)|
| 1:39:00| have some difficult conversations and charge people taxes when we really didn't want to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=5940)|
| 1:39:04| because it's the right thing to do. We all, it's a burden that we all share. So I'm going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=5944)|
| 1:39:11| to make a substitute motion that we deny this, that we recoup these, that those funds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=5951)|
| 1:39:17| are recouped back into this in lieu of tax status.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=5957)|
| 1:39:23| There's a motion on the floor. Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=5963)|
| 1:39:27| I'll second that just for the purpose of discussion of what that would mean.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=5967)|
| 1:39:32| So the substitute motion has been seconded. Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=5972)|
| 1:39:35| Yes, ma'am. Thank you for coming. What kind of money are we talking about every year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=5975)|
| 1:39:42| For the three properties together for in a given year, it's about between $26,000 and $28,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=5982)|
| 1:39:50| Okay. So instead of, and I'm with Commissioner McKenzie, I'm trying to understand, so instead of paying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=5990)|
| 1:39:56| taxes, you're keeping the escrow and the money to do improvements for the seniors at your facility?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=5996)|
| 1:40:02| Yes, specifically so that they can remain independent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=6002)|
| 1:40:06| And are these patients or clients, are they residents, are they on HUD grants, are they independent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=6006)|
| 1:40:16| are they paying as a private citizen? How are they in there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=6016)|
| 1:40:20| To live in the property, you have to meet low income standards. So they all receive some level of HUD funding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=6020)|
| 1:40:28| to live in these because their income is so low that as HUD applies normal standards of what percentage of your income| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=6028)|
| 1:40:35| should go towards rent, they fall below what a reasonable amount is to pay for safe housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=6035)|
| 1:40:42| Okay. Grant, can I grab you for just a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=6042)|
| 1:40:47| Where does the community development, I mean, I know this predates everybody in the room,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=6047)|
| 1:40:51| but where does community development stand on the contract?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=6051)|
| 1:40:56| Well, we would rely on the law department on the existing contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=6056)|
| 1:41:00| I think a good outcome from today would be over the next couple months, sit down with Mercy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=6060)|
| 1:41:08| with Catholic Health Partners, sit down with our law department and HUD, most importantly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=6068)|
| 1:41:13| and come to an agreement and maybe come back to this commission with an amended agreement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=6073)|
| 1:41:20| pilot agreement, because, again, we weren't aware of this pilot agreement until they made us aware of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=6080)|
| 1:41:26| And, again, we would want to sit down with HUD to figure out how to, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=6086)|
| 1:41:31| how to allocate those shelter rents that are currently being allocated and have been since 2006.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=6091)|
| 1:41:37| We're just trying to figure out what do we do with the rents that were owed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=6097)|
| 1:41:41| that were supposed to be set aside between 98 and 2005.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=6101)|
| 1:41:46| So when you say shelter rents, you're just talking about the structure that people are paying rent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=6106)|
| 1:41:51| and part of that money comes out of that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=6111)|
| 1:41:53| It's 10% of the rents minus utilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=6113)|
| 1:41:57| So 10% of those rents minus utilities for these three developments, if I'm correct, Mary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=6117)|
| 1:42:02| were to be set aside in a specific escrow account by this entity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=6122)|
| 1:42:07| They weren't supposed to be paid to us for us to set aside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=6127)|
| 1:42:10| They were just supposed to be set aside by the agency and then, again, applied towards a specific use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=6130)|
| 1:42:21| So you're wanting more time, essentially, to sit down with all the interested partners and see what we can do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=6141)|
| 1:42:27| You know, I think at this point, this body could make a decision on the waiver of the previous years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=6147)|
| 1:42:37| I think moving forward, absolutely, I think it would be a good thing for us to sit down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=6157)|
| 1:42:41| and decide what to do and how those dollars that have been set aside decide how those can be spent moving forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=6161)|
| 1:42:50| I think there's kind of two decisions, there's kind of two tracks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=6170)|
| 1:42:53| The first decision is, again, trying to find a solution to the monies that were supposed to be set aside| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=6173)|
| 1:43:01| that weren't between 98 and 2005.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=6181)|
| 1:43:04| And I think that motion's before you in the form of the written resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=6184)|
| 1:43:09| So is that all we're dealing with today?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=6189)|
| 1:43:11| Today, and then I think from there, a good outcome, Mary and I spoke before the meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=6191)|
| 1:43:16| a good outcome from today would be to sit down with all the parties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=6196)|
| 1:43:20| and come up with a solution that's going to work for everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=6200)|
| 1:43:22| And most importantly, the elderly, low-income folks who are living in these units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=6202)|
| 1:43:28| So we're looking at seven, we're looking at almost $200,000, roughly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=6208)|
| 1:43:32| I think the number was more like $109,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=6212)|
| 1:43:35| $109,000 is the amount that's relative to grant referred to 1998.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=6215)|
| 1:43:43| That's when the construction began, the actual operations and collecting rents didn't begin until 2000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=6223)|
| 1:43:50| $109,000 covers the years 2000 through 2005 when we did not get that included in our rent budget from HUD.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=6230)|
| 1:43:58| So if we deny this waiver, you're going to need to cut Knox County a check for $109,000 is bottom line, is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=6238)|
| 1:44:05| No, that is the amount that we would need to find resources to put into the escrow accounts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=6245)|
| 1:44:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=6251)|
| 1:44:12| For future improvements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=6252)|
| 1:44:13| Yes, for improvements or services for the elderly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=6253)|
| 1:44:16| Knox County's not losing anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=6256)|
| 1:44:18| There's nothing financially at stake currently with this proposal to Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=6258)|
| 1:44:24| Again, it would require them to find those dollars and put them into their own escrow account for the purposes of improving units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=6264)|
| 1:44:33| Again, they're currently putting dollars in there each month, I assume, or each year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=6273)|
| 1:44:38| And, you know, again, moving forward, we want to figure out a solution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=6278)|
| 1:44:42| How they can use those dollars is the next question we want to figure out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=6282)|
| 1:44:47| And that's something we'll handle internally and then come back before you, perhaps with an amendment to this agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=6287)|
| 1:44:54| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=6294)|
| 1:44:55| So where would you get the $109,000?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=6295)|
| 1:44:58| That could be a challenge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=6298)|
| 1:45:00| Right now, as I said, the properties are not in, don't earn a profit or a very minimal profit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=6300)|
| 1:45:06| HUD has not, is not, have a history of going back and retroactively providing funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=6306)|
| 1:45:12| So we would have to, it would be a struggle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=6312)|
| 1:45:16| Each property is supposed to be self-sufficient.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=6316)|
| 1:45:18| This would be a challenge to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=6318)|
| 1:45:20| I'm not sure what our plan would be because that's a fairly substantial amount for these properties to come up with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=6320)|
| 1:45:27| Commissioner, Commissioner Burroughs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=6327)|
| 1:45:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=6329)|
| 1:45:33| I was just wondering if Sam would accept an amendment to set a meeting date for within the next 60 days for HUD| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=6333)|
| 1:45:43| and community development and Catholic partners to sit down and work on a new agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=6343)|
| 1:45:53| So I guess you're asking for a deferral.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=6353)|
| 1:45:55| I mean, that's about the only thing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=6355)|
| 1:45:58| I don't think the new agreement is the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=6358)|
| 1:46:00| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=6360)|
| 1:46:01| It would just be, that would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=6361)|
| 1:46:02| $109,000 is the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=6362)|
| 1:46:08| I guess, you know, I'm still looking at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=6368)|
| 1:46:11| I mean, there was a point to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=6371)|
| 1:46:13| In 1998, there was a driver.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=6373)|
| 1:46:17| There was some concern that, okay, so we're not going to charge you taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=6377)|
| 1:46:23| We're going to bring you a pretty nice deal in terms of not having to feed the income base.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=6383)|
| 1:46:30| But in return for that, we're going to ask for something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=6390)|
| 1:46:34| We're not going to ask, you know, we're going to ask you to do something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=6394)|
| 1:46:37| We're going to give you all of the tools to do it with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=6397)|
| 1:46:40| But we're going to ask you to do something that ultimately is going to benefit our citizens as they age.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=6400)|
| 1:46:46| I would just like for that agreement to be carried out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=6406)|
| 1:46:50| That's my only.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=6410)|
| 1:46:52| And I'd like for us to vote for that because, you know, you're right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=6412)|
| 1:46:56| We're not going to get a financial windfall from this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=6416)|
| 1:46:59| But I do think the residents of these three facilities would get a windfall from that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=6419)|
| 1:47:03| in terms of services that we could provide to them pending that negotiation with community development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=6423)|
| 1:47:10| And I agree with your and support your substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=6430)|
| 1:47:13| I just would like to go ahead and see us take the steps necessary to say we're going to start discussions right away| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=6433)|
| 1:47:21| on reworking this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=6441)|
| 1:47:23| So that's why I was asking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=6443)|
| 1:47:24| Yeah, that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=6444)|
| 1:47:26| So your substitute motion is to deny waiving the ten percent from the years 1998 to 2005.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=6446)|
| 1:47:33| That is the substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=6453)|
| 1:47:34| That is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=6454)|
| 1:47:35| And in encouraging that conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=6455)|
| 1:47:37| Commissioner Andrews.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=6457)|
| 1:47:38| Sam, what about possibly, instead of them having to come up with the money now for escrow,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=6458)|
| 1:47:45| instead of working into the new deal a one or two percent increase that recovers that $109,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=6465)|
| 1:47:50| instead of having them, I mean, I agree with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=6470)|
| 1:47:53| I don't think they should not have to escrow the money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=6473)|
| 1:47:56| But what if we, in our motion, what if we compelled them to do a 12 percent instead of a 10 percent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=6476)|
| 1:48:07| until that $109,000 is paid back?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=6487)|
| 1:48:11| I guess I'll look to the law director and see if that's something that is doable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=6491)|
| 1:48:17| I guess we can do anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=6497)|
| 1:48:19| Well, I mean, at this point you're being asked to divest yourself of funds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=6499)|
| 1:48:23| or at least funds to which you're entitled, and it's essentially a breach of contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=6503)|
| 1:48:27| If you want to try to negotiate something less than that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=6507)|
| 1:48:30| and you can structure it in such a way that it endures to the public benefit, I mean, that's permissible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=6510)|
| 1:48:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=6521)|
| 1:48:43| Grant, is that something that, I'm sorry, ma'am, I didn't ask you either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=6523)|
| 1:48:48| I'm just trying to, I'm trying for you all not to have a $109,000 loss| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=6528)|
| 1:48:51| and us to get what you contracted to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=6531)|
| 1:48:56| That could be a very good proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=6536)|
| 1:48:58| We need to make sure HUD is okay with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=6538)|
| 1:49:00| Because, again, if you're looking at adding an additional 2 percent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=6540)|
| 1:49:05| that's 2 percent that's going to raise the rents 2 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=6545)|
| 1:49:08| And if the rents get to a level that HUD, that aren't in compliance with HUD,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=6548)|
| 1:49:12| then we're going to have, we would have a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=6552)|
| 1:49:14| HUD would have a problem with that, and the whole development would,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=6554)|
| 1:49:17| operation would have a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=6557)|
| 1:49:19| So that's just something we'd have to, again, have to work out with our HUD representatives| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=6559)|
| 1:49:24| and make sure that they're comfortable with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=6564)|
| 1:49:26| Oh, I think the converse is true as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=6566)|
| 1:49:28| I mean, either divesting ourselves of the monies or have an additional requirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=6568)|
| 1:49:33| I think, quite frankly, this may be something you want to defer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=6573)|
| 1:49:36| I know they want an answer today, and they want this to be relieved of this burden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=6576)|
| 1:49:40| Personally, not from a policy standpoint, but legally, I'm not very comfortable with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=6580)|
| 1:49:46| Mr. Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=6586)|
| 1:49:47| Brad, one thing we might want to look at is uncertainty about what's happening with this company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=6587)|
| 1:49:55| There's been talk about them leaving town and whatnot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=6595)|
| 1:49:57| So I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=6597)|
| 1:49:59| That's something for us to keep in mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=6599)|
| 1:50:03| What would, Mr. Jarrett, if they did, if Mercy Health Partners did leave town,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=6603)|
| 1:50:09| what would be the, they would have to divest themselves of those three buildings, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=6609)|
| 1:50:14| Actually, if I could interject.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=6614)|
| 1:50:16| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=6616)|
| 1:50:17| These three properties are not included in the assets that are being looked at in terms of change of ownership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=6617)|
| 1:50:24| These three properties, the title and the ownership is held separately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=6624)|
| 1:50:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=6629)|
| 1:50:30| So it doesn't matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=6630)|
| 1:50:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=6631)|
| 1:50:32| It doesn't matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=6632)|
| 1:50:33| It's part of that contemplated transaction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=6633)|
| 1:50:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=6634)|
| 1:50:35| Motion on the floor is to deny waiving the ten percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=6635)|
| 1:50:40| Roll call, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=6640)|

| 1:50:44| Oh, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=6644)|
| 1:50:45| Commissioner Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=6645)|
| 1:50:46| Yes, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=6646)|
| 1:50:47| I'm going to recuse myself from this vote because I am on the Board of Directors of the Mercy system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=6647)|
| 1:50:54| I used to be a patient there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=6654)|
| 1:50:59| We'll have a roll call vote, and we'll start in the first district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=6659)|
| 1:51:01| Did I have an amendment with it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=6661)|
| 1:51:03| Or this is just a flat denial?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=6663)|
| 1:51:05| This is a flat denial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=6665)|

| 1:52:00| As the maker of the initial motion, Mr. Chairman, I would like to defer, to change my motion to defer this for 30 days and let Grant meet with HUD and see what the best possible, you need 60 days or 30, 60 days?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=6720)|
| 1:52:13| 60 days would be a little bit easier for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=6733)|
| 1:52:15| Till the February meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=6735)|
| 1:52:16| Defer to the February meeting and let HUD become involved in the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=6736)|
| 1:52:20| Does the second agree with that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=6740)|
| 1:52:22| The person that made the second of the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=6742)|
| 1:52:24| Who made the second on the initial?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=6744)|
| 1:52:26| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=6746)|
| 1:52:27| Commissioner Smith, do you agree to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=6747)|
| 1:52:29| 60 day deferral?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=6749)|
| 1:52:30| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=6750)|
| 1:52:31| Okay, he agrees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=6751)|
| 1:52:32| So that is the motion to defer for 60 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=6752)|
| 1:52:34| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=6754)|

| 1:52:36| Any opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=6756)|
| 1:52:37| And Commissioner Briggs recused himself on that vote as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=6757)|
| 1:52:42| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=6762)|
| 1:52:43| Next item is on page four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=6763)|
| 1:52:45| It's resolution 905, authorizing the expenditure of $20,000 from the public improvement fund for renovations to the proposed lease office space on the first floor of the Midway Rehabilitation Center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=6765)|
| 1:52:57| which the Knox County Drug Court desires to relocate its operations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=6777)|
| 1:53:02| Judge Bumgartner said that he would be here, but he had a doctor's appointment and that he would be here after that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=6782)|
| 1:53:08| I do not see Judge Bumgartner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=6788)|
| 1:53:11| So could we go ahead and move this to the end of the agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=6791)|
| 1:53:14| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=6794)|
| 1:53:15| Do you want me to go ahead with the resolution?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=6795)|
| 1:53:18| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=6798)|
| 1:53:19| These resolutions were added.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=6799)|
| 1:53:21| This is resolution 110.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=6801)|
| 1:53:23| It is ratifying the Knox County Mayor's reappointment of Tierney Bates to the Knox County Personnel Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=6803)|
| 1:53:29| Is there a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=6809)|
| 1:53:30| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=6810)|
| 1:53:31| Second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=6811)|
| 1:53:32| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=6812)|
| 1:53:33| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=6813)|
| 1:53:34| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=6814)|
| 1:53:35| Motion approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=6815)|
| 1:53:36| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=6816)|
| 1:53:37| Resolution 111 is appointing a member to the Knox County Personnel Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=6817)|
| 1:53:43| Now that is a commission appointment, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=6823)|
| 1:53:45| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=6825)|
| 1:53:46| So I don't think we have a name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=6826)|
| 1:53:48| So could we defer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=6828)|
| 1:53:50| Is there a motion to defer this for 30 days?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=6830)|
| 1:53:53| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=6833)|
| 1:53:54| I just have a question about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=6834)|
| 1:53:55| Is that one that needs to be a county employee or can it be a citizen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=6835)|
| 1:53:59| There's Francis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=6839)|
| 1:54:00| It needs to be a citizen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=6840)|
| 1:54:01| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=6841)|
| 1:54:02| Francis, could you shed some light on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=6842)|
| 1:54:04| It must be a citizen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=6844)|
| 1:54:07| And I'll tell you, for gender balance, I would prefer if you could find a female.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=6847)|
| 1:54:17| I'm wondering, should we appoint someone to come up with some names?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=6857)|
| 1:54:24| Or does any commissioner want to present some names?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=6864)|
| 1:54:28| Francis, are you in a situation where you're going to lose a quorum?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=6868)|
| 1:54:31| Do you need this now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=6871)|
| 1:54:32| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=6872)|
| 1:54:33| We can go another month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=6873)|
| 1:54:34| We have four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=6874)|
| 1:54:35| Any commissioner who has a citizen that they'd like to nominate for this, just give it to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=6875)|
| 1:54:41| the commission office and we'll address it next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=6881)|
| 1:54:44| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=6884)|
| 1:54:45| We have 142 notary applications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=6885)|
| 1:54:48| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=6888)|

| 1:54:52| Notary applications are approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=6892)|

| 1:54:55| It's Ordinance O-10-11-101.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=6895)|
| 1:54:58| It is amending sections 2-581, 2-647 and 2-691 of the Knox County Code relative to contract| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=6898)|
| 1:55:07| modifications and emergency purchases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=6907)|

| 1:55:15| I make a motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=6915)|
| 1:55:16| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=6916)|
| 1:55:17| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=6917)|
| 1:55:18| Who is the second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=6918)|
| 1:55:19| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=6919)|
| 1:55:20| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=6920)|
| 1:55:21| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=6921)|
| 1:55:22| Motion passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=6922)|
| 1:55:23| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=6923)|
| 1:55:24| Discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=6924)|
| 1:55:25| We had a discussion item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=6925)|
| 1:55:26| Tony, did you have, Commissioner Norman, did you have a discussion item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=6926)|
| 1:55:29| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=6929)|
| 1:55:30| I just wanted to update the commission on the Health and Human Services Act.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=6930)|
| 1:55:36| I just wanted to update the commission on the Hillside Task Force process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=6936)|
| 1:55:42| We just had this, the plan, the Hillside plan went before MPC in November.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=6942)|
| 1:55:49| They deferred it for a month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=6949)|
| 1:55:52| We wrestled with some provisions in the plan mightily for about four weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=6952)|
| 1:55:59| We think that there's some really, there should be for the development community that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=6959)|
| 1:56:07| was in opposition that had some qualms about certain parts of the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=6967)|
| 1:56:12| We thought that there's some flexibility that's built in that should be very appealing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=6972)|
| 1:56:18| to developers and real estate folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=6978)|
| 1:56:23| Not that the task force had those people on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=6983)|
| 1:56:29| We have quite a variety, quite a diversity of professional interest on the task force.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=6989)|
| 1:56:37| In the two and a half years that all this was wrestled with, we still, it was surprising| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=6997)|
| 1:56:43| when it went to the MPC and there's some pretty strong-willed folks on MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=7003)|
| 1:56:51| But in the push and pull, I think we got, we made some adjustments to the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=7011)|
| 1:56:58| The plan was voted on and it was approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=7018)|
| 1:57:01| 12-2 MPC this last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=7021)|
| 1:57:05| So that was a big sigh of relief for those of us that are heavily invested in this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=7025)|
| 1:57:15| It should be before us, we're still anticipating some issues with city council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=7035)|
| 1:57:24| because of the mayor situation, of course, and the appointment process that's got to take place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=7044)|
| 1:57:30| So theoretically it would come to us in January.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=7050)|
| 1:57:35| Somehow I think that it might be wise for us to back it off a little bit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=7055)|
| 1:57:39| let you all have plenty of time to look at it, see the things that have changed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=7059)|
| 1:57:44| the document that will be before you, it's going to have a few changes in it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=7064)|
| 1:57:49| from the things that you've received.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=7069)|
| 1:57:52| So I think they're all much easier to, I think it will be much more palatable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=7072)|
| 1:58:00| to the side of the community that tends to push back against some of the things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=7080)|
| 1:58:07| that we think are very appropriate, the types of protections on the hillside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=7087)|
| 1:58:14| All in all, I think it's good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=7094)|
| 1:58:16| I think things will be good eventually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=7096)|
| 1:58:19| We'll all live happily ever after, I hope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=7099)|
| 1:58:24| Thank you, Commissioner, for your work on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=7104)|
| 1:58:26| I know you've been spending many, many months on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=7106)|
| 1:58:28| so I know you're anxious to see a conclusion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=7108)|
| 1:58:31| Is there any other business to come before this commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=7111)|
| 1:58:34| I'll remind you that because we are meeting on Friday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=7114)|
| 1:58:37| we had moved the zonings to 4 o'clock,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=7117)|
| 1:58:40| so in one hour we will reconvene to hear zonings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=7120)|
| 1:58:43| and you've seen the agenda, so you know what we have facing us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=7123)|
| 1:58:47| Commissioner Burroughs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=7127)|
| 1:58:48| Yes, I just wanted to say thank you to all the commissioners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=7128)|
| 1:58:52| who came out to the community Thanksgiving potluck last month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=7132)|
| 1:58:57| Over the course of the evening we had about 100 people come through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=7137)|
| 1:59:02| and bring dishes to share and everybody really enjoyed it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=7142)|
| 1:59:07| A lot of people commented that it was nice to see so many commissioners there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=7147)|
| 1:59:12| some that they had not had the opportunity to meet before| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=7152)|
| 1:59:15| and we're going to try to make this a yearly event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=7155)|
| 1:59:18| So thanks to everybody who came out for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=7158)|
| 1:59:21| We might do it again on the 4th of July.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=7161)|
| 1:59:23| We'll just see how everything's going,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=7163)|
| 1:59:25| but I appreciate everybody taking the time to come to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=7165)|
| 1:59:28| Great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=7168)|
| 1:59:29| Yes, Commissioner Wright?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=7169)|
| 1:59:31| What did we do with the resolution on the drug court?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=7171)|
| 1:59:34| Oh, I'm sorry, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=7174)|
| 1:59:35| Oh, Judge Baumgartner just walked in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=7175)|
| 1:59:37| Speaking of Judge Baumgartner, so let's go back to that item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=7177)|
| 1:59:40| Thank you, Judge, for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=7180)|
| 1:59:42| Clerk, if you'd read the item into the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=7182)|
| 1:59:49| This is a resolution authorizing the expenditure of $20,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=7189)|
| 1:59:52| from the Public Improvement Fund| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=7192)|
| 1:59:54| for renovations to the proposed leased office space| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=7194)|
| 1:59:57| on the first floor of the Midway Rehabilitation Center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=7197)|
| 2:00:00| which the Knox County Drug Court desires to relocate its operations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=7200)|
| 2:00:04| Is there a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=7204)|
| 2:00:06| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=7206)|
| 2:00:07| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=7207)|
| 2:00:09| Second by Commissioner Longby.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=7209)|
| 2:00:11| Judge Baumgartner, thank you again for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=7211)|
| 2:00:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=7214)|
| 2:00:16| I apologize for being a little late.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=7216)|
| 2:00:18| I had a doctor's appointment and I just got back from that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=7218)|
| 2:00:25| Ladies and gentlemen, we are here requesting $20,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=7225)|
| 2:00:30| The purpose is to renovate...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=7230)|
| 2:00:34| Let me explain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=7234)|
| 2:00:36| Midway runs a halfway house at 1515 Magnolia Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=7236)|
| 2:00:40| The bottom floor is empty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=7240)|
| 2:00:42| They want and we want very much for us to move into that bottom floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=7242)|
| 2:00:48| I have here architectural drawings of that space| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=7248)|
| 2:00:52| that have already been done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=7252)|
| 2:00:54| and we've been working on this project for at least 18 months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=7254)|
| 2:00:58| And Midway is willing to build out the space for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=7258)|
| 2:01:05| They sold their property at the old Broadway intersection down there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=7265)|
| 2:01:11| and they have $90,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=7271)|
| 2:01:14| and they've got a bid that says that they can renovate the place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=7274)|
| 2:01:20| for about $90,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=7280)|
| 2:01:22| but they're concerned that they're going to go over budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=7282)|
| 2:01:26| and the board is nervous about proceeding with this project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=7286)|
| 2:01:31| and through negotiation we said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=7291)|
| 2:01:35| well, what if we could come up with $20,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=7295)|
| 2:01:39| to assure you that you would not go over budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=7299)|
| 2:01:43| by getting that $20,000 to you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=7303)|
| 2:01:47| They said, we can accept that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=7307)|
| 2:01:50| What this will do is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=7310)|
| 2:01:52| we are currently in a space of 3,200 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=7312)|
| 2:01:56| Right now we're paying $4,300 or $4,400 plus utilities for that space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=7316)|
| 2:02:02| By moving to Midway we will have 8,000 square feet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=7322)|
| 2:02:07| about 4,500 to 5,000 of which we would use immediately| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=7327)|
| 2:02:12| leaving the rest of it hopefully for some residential facility in the future| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=7332)|
| 2:02:17| if we can ever find grant money for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=7337)|
| 2:02:21| So it gives us incredible space for our needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=7341)|
| 2:02:29| It's in a perfect location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=7349)|
| 2:02:31| It's in the Midway halfway house| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=7351)|
| 2:02:34| that has been operating for some 35 or 40 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=7354)|
| 2:02:38| It's a well-respected halfway house| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=7358)|
| 2:02:41| that handles mostly federal inmates who are leaving prison.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=7361)|
| 2:02:47| And like I said, we've been negotiating with them on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=7367)|
| 2:02:53| We operate, the Knott's County Drug Court operates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=7373)|
| 2:02:57| fully on grant funds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=7377)|
| 2:03:01| and the Drug Court Drug Act| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=7381)|
| 2:03:04| which provides us about $55,000 a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=7384)|
| 2:03:07| The state currently provides us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=7387)|
| 2:03:10| although they cut us some this year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=7390)|
| 2:03:13| it was a half a million dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=7393)|
| 2:03:16| It's now 450 or 425, I'm not sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=7396)|
| 2:03:22| Before that, and Law Director Jarrett has sent a letter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=7402)|
| 2:03:28| I don't know if any of you have seen it or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=7408)|
| 2:03:30| And I've missed getting together with Mr. Jarrett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=7410)|
| 2:03:34| We were going to try and meet earlier this week| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=7414)|
| 2:03:36| and I tried to get with him yesterday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=7416)|
| 2:03:39| But he expressed this concern| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=7419)|
| 2:03:44| that this was an expenditure of this money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=7424)|
| 2:03:47| and that we've expressly expressed to Commission in the past| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=7427)|
| 2:03:52| when they've approved these grant funds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=7432)|
| 2:03:55| that they were specifically without any money from the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=7435)|
| 2:04:00| That's true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=7440)|
| 2:04:02| We haven't gotten a penny from the county since before 2002.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=7442)|
| 2:04:07| The county did defend us in a discrimination action| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=7447)|
| 2:04:12| by an employee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=7452)|
| 2:04:14| They represented us in that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=7454)|
| 2:04:17| and they settled that case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=7457)|
| 2:04:21| It was one of our employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=7461)|
| 2:04:23| but because of the legal situation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=7463)|
| 2:04:26| they felt obligated to represent us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=7466)|
| 2:04:30| We could not have done it anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=7470)|
| 2:04:32| I wanted to fully disclose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=7472)|
| 2:04:38| We have another concern that Mr. Jarrett raised in his letter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=7478)|
| 2:04:42| was a contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=7482)|
| 2:04:44| And we have been working on a contract| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=7484)|
| 2:04:48| with a member of his staff, Miss Wilcox,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=7488)|
| 2:04:54| for a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=7494)|
| 2:04:56| Joe, I can't think of Joe's last name right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=7496)|
| 2:05:00| but represents Midway, a lawyer, Joe Levitt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=7500)|
| 2:05:04| And he sent her a contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=7504)|
| 2:05:07| It was not acceptable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=7507)|
| 2:05:10| She sent it back with many things taken out of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=7510)|
| 2:05:15| They negotiated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=7515)|
| 2:05:17| I was in the last negotiating session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=7517)|
| 2:05:19| Mr. Levitt just loves to negotiate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=7519)|
| 2:05:22| But we got down to where we felt like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=7522)|
| 2:05:27| we were literally two or three words away from agreement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=7527)|
| 2:05:31| if we could come up with this $20,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=7531)|
| 2:05:34| I went to the mayor and asked him| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=7534)|
| 2:05:37| if there was any possibility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=7537)|
| 2:05:39| that there were funds available for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=7539)|
| 2:05:41| I started with Mr. Troyer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=7541)|
| 2:05:43| and then I talked to Mayor Burchard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=7543)|
| 2:05:46| and his assistant, Mr. Rice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=7546)|
| 2:05:49| They looked at what we had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=7549)|
| 2:05:52| and I can tell you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=7552)|
| 2:05:55| I've been authorized to tell you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=7555)|
| 2:05:57| that they support this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=7557)|
| 2:05:59| and that they feel that they have the money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=7559)|
| 2:06:01| I don't know, but they have found this money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=7561)|
| 2:06:06| They feel it's available for this project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=7566)|
| 2:06:09| and I don't want to wear you out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=7569)|
| 2:06:11| but just let me tell you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=7571)|
| 2:06:13| what the Drug Court does for Knotts County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=7573)|
| 2:06:16| We have graduated about 125 people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=7576)|
| 2:06:20| It takes about two years to graduate from this program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=7580)|
| 2:06:24| In addition to those people that we have graduated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=7584)|
| 2:06:27| there are many, many others,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=7587)|
| 2:06:30| tens of others,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=7590)|
| 2:06:32| who have, although they have not completed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=7592)|
| 2:06:35| the strict requirements of the program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=7595)|
| 2:06:38| they have not re-offended and they have not re-used.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=7598)|
| 2:06:41| For some other reason,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=7601)|
| 2:06:43| they were unable to complete the program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=7603)|
| 2:06:45| but they have not re-offended or not re-used.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=7605)|
| 2:06:47| These people are already in the system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=7607)|
| 2:06:50| We don't go out and find these people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=7610)|
| 2:06:52| These people have been arrested,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=7612)|
| 2:06:54| they've been convicted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=7614)|
| 2:06:56| they've been in jail,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=7616)|
| 2:06:58| they're either going back to jail| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=7618)|
| 2:07:00| or they're going to be in our program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=7620)|
| 2:07:03| I tried to do some rough calculations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=7623)|
| 2:07:06| and let's say that in the last ten years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=7626)|
| 2:07:11| I'll take 150 people as a low estimate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=7631)|
| 2:07:15| that we've kept out of the Knotts County jail system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=7635)|
| 2:07:19| And let's say that over that ten-year period| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=7639)|
| 2:07:22| that we only kept them out of jail| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=7642)|
| 2:07:24| for a year out of ten years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=7644)|
| 2:07:26| And if you look at people's records,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=7646)|
| 2:07:28| ladies and gentlemen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=7648)|
| 2:07:30| you will find that people on drugs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=7650)|
| 2:07:32| are constantly in trouble with the law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=7652)|
| 2:07:35| because they have no source other than| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=7655)|
| 2:07:38| stealing and forgeries| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=7658)|
| 2:07:40| and writing bad scripts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=7660)|
| 2:07:42| and whatever, breaking into your house| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=7662)|
| 2:07:44| or your car or whatever| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=7664)|
| 2:07:46| to get their money to buy their drugs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=7666)|
| 2:07:48| And so these people go to jail all the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=7668)|
| 2:07:53| Say we kept 150 people out of jail| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=7673)|
| 2:07:57| for one year on the average.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=7677)|
| 2:08:00| That would save Knotts County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=7680)|
| 2:08:02| at $80 a day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=7682)|
| 2:08:04| $4,380,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=7684)|
| 2:08:09| And that doesn't count the people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=7689)|
| 2:08:11| who are in the program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=7691)|
| 2:08:13| We lose people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=7693)|
| 2:08:15| We are not successful with everybody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=7695)|
| 2:08:17| but we're successful with a lot of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=7697)|
| 2:08:19| We've changed a lot of lives| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=7699)|
| 2:08:21| and the people we're successful with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=7701)|
| 2:08:23| are now out there working,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=7703)|
| 2:08:25| paying taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=7705)|
| 2:08:27| They're getting their children back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=7707)|
| 2:08:29| from family services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=7709)|
| 2:08:31| They're having drug-free babies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=7711)|
| 2:08:34| You know, this is a successful program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=7714)|
| 2:08:37| This is a program that works| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=7717)|
| 2:08:39| and it keeps people out of the jail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=7719)|
| 2:08:42| And that's a real benefit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=7722)|
| 2:08:46| to this county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=7726)|
| 2:08:48| and it keeps people from re-offending.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=7728)|
| 2:08:52| So I'm here asking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=7732)|
| 2:08:55| that you approve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=7735)|
| 2:08:57| this one-time $20,000 expenditure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=7737)|
| 2:09:01| so that we can finally| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=7741)|
| 2:09:04| make this move| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=7744)|
| 2:09:06| that we've been looking at for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=7746)|
| 2:09:08| longer than that and negotiating on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=7748)|
| 2:09:10| for at least 18 months| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=7750)|
| 2:09:12| and get in this space| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=7752)|
| 2:09:14| which would be of great benefit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=7754)|
| 2:09:16| to the Knotts County Drug Court| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=7756)|
| 2:09:19| and I think to Knotts County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=7759)|
| 2:09:23| I'd be glad to answer any questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=7763)|
| 2:09:25| that anybody has.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=7765)|
| 2:09:27| Let me say by means of disclosure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=7767)|
| 2:09:29| that I was on the Drug Court Advisory Board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=7769)|
| 2:09:31| and had to resign| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=7771)|
| 2:09:33| because of time commitments and so forth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=7773)|
| 2:09:35| but I just want to echo what the judges said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=7775)|
| 2:09:37| Having seen how this program works,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=7777)|
| 2:09:39| it works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=7779)|
| 2:09:41| It's a tough program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=7781)|
| 2:09:44| It's hard to get in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=7784)|
| 2:09:45| but once you get in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=7785)|
| 2:09:46| it's also hard to stay in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=7786)|
| 2:09:47| because they're very rigorous| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=7787)|
| 2:09:49| in the amount of drug testing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=7789)|
| 2:09:50| that has to go on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=7790)|
| 2:09:51| the amount of accountability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=7791)|
| 2:09:52| I've never seen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=7792)|
| 2:09:53| the amount of accountability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=7793)|
| 2:09:54| that they have in this drug court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=7794)|
| 2:09:55| If you go through this program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=7795)|
| 2:09:57| you will become a productive citizen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=7797)|
| 2:09:58| and a lot of people do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=7798)|
| 2:10:00| And so I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=7800)|
| 2:10:02| by means of disclosure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=7802)|
| 2:10:03| I want to say that I was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=7803)|
| 2:10:04| I'm not now on the Drug Court| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=7804)|
| 2:10:06| but I support this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=7806)|
| 2:10:07| because I just have seen first-hand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=7807)|
| 2:10:09| the work that they do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=7809)|
| 2:10:10| and the lives that have been changed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=7810)|
| 2:10:12| and the opportunities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=7812)|
| 2:10:13| that people have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=7813)|
| 2:10:14| to go into this program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=7814)|
| 2:10:15| as opposed to being| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=7815)|
| 2:10:16| in the jail system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=7816)|
| 2:10:17| Commissioner Anders| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=7817)|
| 2:10:18| I believe your light was on first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=7818)|
| 2:10:19| Yes, Your Honor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=7819)|
| 2:10:20| you spoke| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=7820)|
| 2:10:21| just briefly about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=7821)|
| 2:10:22| what you're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=7822)|
| 2:10:23| you're moving from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=7823)|
| 2:10:24| 3,400 square feet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=7824)|
| 2:10:25| to 5,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=7825)|
| 2:10:26| potentially 8,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=7826)|
| 2:10:27| and you're paying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=7827)|
| 2:10:28| 4,400 currently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=7828)|
| 2:10:29| What are you going to be paying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=7829)|
| 2:10:30| at Midway?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=7830)|
| 2:10:31| 4,150| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=7831)|
| 2:10:32| and they paid the utilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=7832)|
| 2:10:34| Our rent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=7834)|
| 2:10:36| over at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=7836)|
| 2:10:38| the space in Richardson Square| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=7838)|
| 2:10:40| that we've been in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=7840)|
| 2:10:41| for at least 10 years now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=7841)|
| 2:10:42| was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=7842)|
| 2:10:44| about 3,800| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=7844)|
| 2:10:46| and we had to pay utilities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=7846)|
| 2:10:48| which made it right at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=7848)|
| 2:10:49| close to 4,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=7849)|
| 2:10:51| Our contract with them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=7851)|
| 2:10:52| recently ran out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=7852)|
| 2:10:54| and so they've upped our rent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=7854)|
| 2:10:56| about $500| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=7856)|
| 2:10:58| because we didn't want to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=7858)|
| 2:11:00| sign another long-term contract| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=7860)|
| 2:11:02| so we're currently paying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=7862)|
| 2:11:04| about $4,400 I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=7864)|
| 2:11:06| plus utilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=7866)|
| 2:11:08| But the cost at Midway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=7868)|
| 2:11:10| is $4,150 a month| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=7870)|
| 2:11:11| for rent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=7871)|
| 2:11:13| and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=7873)|
| 2:11:15| they understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=7875)|
| 2:11:17| that if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=7877)|
| 2:11:19| for some reason for instance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=7879)|
| 2:11:21| the state were to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=7881)|
| 2:11:23| cut our funding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=7883)|
| 2:11:25| that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=7885)|
| 2:11:27| it would terminate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=7887)|
| 2:11:29| our contract would be terminated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=7889)|
| 2:11:31| with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=7891)|
| 2:11:33| They understand that it's contingent upon us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=7893)|
| 2:11:35| continuing to be able to operate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=7895)|
| 2:11:37| with grant money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=7897)|
| 2:11:39| So there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=7899)|
| 2:11:41| you know I don't want to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=7901)|
| 2:11:43| mislead anybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=7903)|
| 2:11:45| It's true that we would be spending| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=7905)|
| 2:11:47| $20,000 on a building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=7907)|
| 2:11:49| that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=7909)|
| 2:11:51| don't own and we will never| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=7911)|
| 2:11:53| own but it's a space| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=7913)|
| 2:11:55| that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=7915)|
| 2:11:57| that's so conducive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=7917)|
| 2:11:59| to what we're doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=7919)|
| 2:12:01| and it's such a small amount| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=7921)|
| 2:12:03| in the overall scheme of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=7923)|
| 2:12:05| things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=7925)|
| 2:12:07| that we think it's very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=7927)|
| 2:12:09| cost effective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=7929)|
| 2:12:11| So did that answer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=7931)|
| 2:12:13| your question? It did answer my question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=7933)|
| 2:12:15| but what and it is a small amount| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=7935)|
| 2:12:17| of money and your rent's going down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=7937)|
| 2:12:19| but what bothers me about it is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=7939)|
| 2:12:21| before they even| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=7941)|
| 2:12:23| drive a nail we're giving them $20,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=7943)|
| 2:12:25| in case they go over budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=7945)|
| 2:12:27| Oh no| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=7947)|
| 2:12:29| That was your statement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=7949)|
| 2:12:31| before I mean in case they go over budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=7951)|
| 2:12:33| I think we built a school in my district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=7953)|
| 2:12:35| with that method and it didn't work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=7955)|
| 2:12:39| It is a small amount| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=7959)|
| 2:12:41| drug court does work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=7961)|
| 2:12:43| but I think it's bad| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=7963)|
| 2:12:45| policy to negotiate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=7965)|
| 2:12:47| giving somebody $20,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=7967)|
| 2:12:49| before they even attempt to do it for the $90,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=7969)|
| 2:12:51| they thought they could do it for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=7971)|
| 2:12:53| although I'll support it because I think it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=7973)|
| 2:12:55| well intended I think that's a poor way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=7975)|
| 2:12:57| to negotiate a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=7977)|
| 2:12:59| $20,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=7979)|
| 2:13:01| giving somebody $20,000 that we'll never recoup| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=7981)|
| 2:13:03| number 1 and number 2| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=7983)|
| 2:13:05| we didn't even ask them to drive the first nail| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=7985)|
| 2:13:07| before they chose to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=7987)|
| 2:13:09| we're giving them $20,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=7989)|
| 2:13:11| to go over budget with is essentially what we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=7991)|
| 2:13:13| doing and I think that's a poor way to negotiate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=7993)|
| 2:13:15| any kind of deal like that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=7995)|
| 2:13:17| What I was told| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=7997)|
| 2:13:19| by the board members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=7999)|
| 2:13:21| was that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8001)|
| 2:13:23| they were you know this $90,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8003)|
| 2:13:25| of course they're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8005)|
| 2:13:27| also a non-profit that runs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8007)|
| 2:13:29| on federal funds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8009)|
| 2:13:31| that this $90,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8011)|
| 2:13:33| that they've got| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8013)|
| 2:13:35| if in fact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8015)|
| 2:13:37| they end up spending every| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8017)|
| 2:13:39| penny of it or it gets to the point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8019)|
| 2:13:41| where it's going to go over it's going to wipe their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8021)|
| 2:13:43| entire| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8023)|
| 2:13:45| excess amounts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8025)|
| 2:13:47| available to them out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8027)|
| 2:13:49| and they want the assurance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8029)|
| 2:13:51| on the front end and we can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8031)|
| 2:13:53| certainly include in the contract| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8033)|
| 2:13:55| a clause that says| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8035)|
| 2:13:57| if it's not built| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8037)|
| 2:13:59| if they do not proceed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8039)|
| 2:14:01| with the project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8041)|
| 2:14:03| that the money wouldn't flow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8043)|
| 2:14:05| I don't think they should get it until| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8045)|
