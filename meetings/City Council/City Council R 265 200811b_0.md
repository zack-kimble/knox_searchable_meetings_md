| 0:07:40| Let me pull it up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=460)|
| 0:07:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=462)|
| 0:07:44| First of all, it's good to see everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=464)|
| 0:07:46| Glad to be meeting again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=466)|
| 0:07:48| I want to start my mayor's report, as I have been the last several months, to discussing the COVID-19 pandemic here in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=468)|
| 0:07:58| The good news is that masks work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=478)|
| 0:08:00| The face covering mandate that the Board of Health adopted in July is slowing the spread of the virus and reducing the rate of hospitalizations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=480)|
| 0:08:08| I'm so grateful for all the people and businesses in Knoxville who are wearing masks and who are following all five of the five core actions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=488)|
| 0:08:16| There is some cautionary news.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=496)|
| 0:08:18| Our numbers are not actually dropping.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=498)|
| 0:08:20| They're just increasing at a slower rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=500)|
| 0:08:22| Two weeks ago, we had 1,893 active cases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=502)|
| 0:08:28| Today, August 11th, we have 2,261 active cases, a net increase of 369.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=508)|
| 0:08:36| As you all know, we are also about this week, UT students, approaching 30,000 students are going to be returning to campus on August 24th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=516)|
| 0:08:46| Before our next council meeting, another close to 50,000 students and staff will be returning to in-person school in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=526)|
| 0:08:54| So the reason I call this cautionary thing is that we're having some positive results from the face masks, but we need to mitigate the spread of this virus to help keep our schools and businesses open to prevent our hospitals from being overwhelmed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=534)|
| 0:09:10| So we really, really need to remain vigilant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=550)|
| 0:09:12| So thanks to all the council members who are helping spread the word.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=552)|
| 0:09:14| As you know, we can all do our part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=554)|
| 0:09:16| I've said it a bunch of times, but it bears repeating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=556)|
| 0:09:20| We are taking all core actions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=560)|
| 0:09:22| We are washing our hands, wearing a mask, sanitizing surfaces, practicing physical distancing, and staying home if sick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=562)|
| 0:09:30| I also want to mention, and Council Member Fugate's invocation was very relevant to this, this pandemic has impacted all of our lives and daily routines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=570)|
| 0:09:40| So many neighbors are facing extra stress, worrying about health, worrying how they will pay their rent and how they might care for their families.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=580)|
| 0:09:48| I'm sure all Knoxvillians know that they are not alone and that help is available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=588)|
| 0:09:52| If you know someone, if you or someone you know is facing eviction, please call 2-1-1 to help connect to the City of Knoxville COVID-19 Housing Assistance Program, which still has funds available to help residents stay in their homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=592)|
| 0:10:06| And more housing help is on the way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=606)|
| 0:10:08| Yesterday, I joined our Housing and Neighborhood Development staff and more than a dozen local social service agencies to discuss how to utilize an additional $2.2 million in federal funds to support individuals and families experiencing homelessness and those at risk of experiencing homelessness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=608)|
| 0:10:26| We're going to continue to discuss ways to engage both established and smaller nonprofits and organizations serving the growing housing needs in our community to ensure that those federal dollars reach the people who need them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=626)|
| 0:10:38| Our physical and economic well-being are vital, but so is our mental health.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=638)|
| 0:10:44| I'm very pleased to announce today that Helen Ross McNabb has a new emotional support and resource helpline to provide support for individuals affected by the pandemic and to connect callers with other resources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=644)|
| 0:10:56| So, when you call this line, bachelors and masters level clinicians will be answering the COVID-19 helpline, 8 a.m. to 5 p.m., Monday through Friday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=656)|
| 0:11:08| If you reach the helpline after hours, you can leave a message and the call will be returned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=668)|
| 0:11:13| The number to call is 855.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=673)|
| 0:11:16| I'm not misspeaking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=676)|
| 0:11:18| It's 855, not 865.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=678)|
| 0:11:20| 855, toll-free number, 855-661-9191.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=680)|
| 0:11:28| So, if you guys put that out on various social media, and please spread the word because I think this can be an important resource as we're all dealing with extra stress and anxiety at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=688)|
| 0:11:40| And I really mean everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=700)|
| 0:11:42| I don't know anyone who hasn't been affected to some degree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=702)|
| 0:11:46| So, on happier news, as we alluded before the meeting got officially started, I'm very glad this week to welcome two new members to my team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=706)|

| 0:12:18| And I believe she's had the chance to speak to most council members already, and I know that you all enjoy working with her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=738)|
| 0:12:24| I also want to give a shout-out and express my gratitude to Boyce Evans for serving as interim finance director for the last eight months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=744)|
| 0:12:32| He has helped us navigate through a really challenging financial landscape and very dynamic and changing one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=752)|
| 0:12:38| So, thank you, Mr. Evans, for providing strong leadership, and I know you'll continue to do so as our deputy director of finance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=758)|

| 0:13:04| Many of you know Kathy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=784)|

| 0:13:18| So, very glad to welcome those two new people to our team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=798)|

| 0:13:24| Are there reports of councilmembers or committees?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=804)|
| 0:13:30| Councilmember Fugate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=810)|
| 0:13:32| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=812)|
| 0:13:34| Fellow councilmembers, I want to let you know that I have been working on a committee for the last, since around March, that is made up with folks from Justice Knox, the mayor's administration,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=814)|
| 0:13:48| and I are working on an affordable housing task force, working to bring you an ordinance sometime before the budget gets approved, dealing with how we create some dedicated or minimum sort of funding for affordable housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=828)|
| 0:14:08| The details are being worked out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=848)|
| 0:14:10| That's the initial group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=850)|
| 0:14:12| The group is looking to expand to bring other stakeholders involved so that by the time we get an ordinance, many people, we hope most everyone that has a vested interest in affordable housing will know what the ordinance is and be supportive of it and onboard before we bring it to council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=852)|
| 0:14:30| So, just wanted to let you know that's coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=870)|
| 0:14:32| Don't want to blindside you with some ordinance that you didn't know was coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=872)|
| 0:14:38| So, just wanted to let you know we're working on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=878)|
| 0:14:40| Thank you, Councilmember Fugate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=880)|

| 0:14:46| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=886)|

| 0:15:29| And so, there's a virtual option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=929)|

| 0:19:23| Yes, and you are speaking in favor of the appeal, and you have up to five minutes to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=1163)|
| 0:19:27| Please start by stating your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=1167)|
| 0:19:31| My name is Bob Cole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=1171)|
| 0:19:33| My address is 2313 Pulaski Road, 37914.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=1173)|
| 0:19:39| I'm here for Bill Clark who's seeking some variances so that he can purchase a very small tract of property from KUB that a garage of his encroaches on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=1179)|
| 0:19:53| Bill is a native Knoxvillian and has lived here his entire life except when he was away for military service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=1193)|
| 0:19:59| He grew up in the same neighborhood where he now resides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=1199)|
| 0:20:03| Bill served four years in the Army and then four more in the Air Force.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=1203)|
| 0:20:07| His service included service during the Korean War.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=1207)|
| 0:20:11| After the war, he worked as a chemical operator at Oak Ridge and in 1958 was involved in the largest nuclear accident which has occurred at Oak Ridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=1211)|
| 0:20:23| Six of his coworkers have died from that exposure starting in their early 40s, all from cancer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=1223)|
| 0:20:31| Bill has so far survived two bouts of colon cancer associated with that exposure, but he is the last survivor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=1231)|
| 0:20:41| Each year, he has to go to have medical examinations to determine what that exposure has done to him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=1241)|
| 0:20:49| Bill's mother bought this property in 1967, and Bill inherited it when she passed away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=1249)|
| 0:20:57| I sent a photo, which I hope all of you received, of his mom, a white-haired lady, standing in front of a red pickup truck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=1257)|
| 0:21:07| We don't know exactly when that photo was taken, but that's a 1968 GMC truck that Bill bought new and owned only for four years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=1267)|
| 0:21:17| You can see in that photo that his mother is standing on asphalt pavement in the backyard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=1277)|
| 0:21:23| The boat shown in the photo is under a carport where the current garage is located, showing that the roof coverage that a variance has asked for has also been there for almost 50 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=1283)|
| 0:21:35| The asphalt, like I say, has been there in the backyard for the entire period of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=1295)|
| 0:21:43| All of these variances requested have existed for years and years, most before Bill ever owned the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=1303)|
| 0:21:51| The code provides that you can grant variances for unreasonable hardships.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=1311)|
| 0:21:57| Bill is 87 years old. He's on a fixed income.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=1317)|
| 0:22:03| How much will it cost to demolish apparently multiple garages and carports and have heavy equipment come in and dig up and remove the asphalt in the backyard and haul it off and then re-sod it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=1323)|
| 0:22:17| Thousands of dollars or tens of thousands of dollars?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=1337)|
| 0:22:21| Bill's daughter, to add more problems, is one of those whose jobs has been eliminated due to COVID-19.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=1341)|
| 0:22:31| I'm sure he'll be trying to help her out at least for a while.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=1351)|
| 0:22:35| Bill didn't create his problems. He inherited his problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=1355)|
| 0:22:41| This came to the attention of the codes people only when KUB, after nearly 50 years, noticed that there was an encroachment on their property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=1361)|
| 0:22:51| Our codes folks investigate complaints, and if a violation exists, they issue citations and warning letters. That's their job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=1371)|
| 0:23:00| No complaints were ever presented. No citizens have been present to protest any of these variances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=1380)|
| 0:23:08| It's up to you to determine if there can be some leniency or forgiveness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=1388)|
| 0:23:13| After so much time, nearly 50 years, are you going to refuse these variances and cause this 87-year-old veteran and Cold War patriot to have to destroy the home that he's lived in since 1981?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=1393)|
| 0:23:28| There's no definition in the code for what is an unreasonable hardship, but I can't think how things could be much tougher for Mr. Clark. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=1408)|
| 0:23:47| Thank you, Mr. Cole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=1427)|
| 0:23:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=1430)|
| 0:23:53| That concludes all the people who signed up to speak on this item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=1433)|
| 0:23:58| Council members, Council Member Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=1438)|
| 0:24:01| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=1441)|
| 0:24:06| Thank you, Mr. Cole, for speaking and presenting that side of things, and I'm sorry that it was the unfortunate circumstance where you couldn't speak last time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=1446)|
| 0:24:17| I would like to ask our Council, Mr. Frost, to review Section 16 Appendix B of our code for what a hardship is based upon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=1457)|
| 0:24:37| Thank you, Council Member Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=1477)|
| 0:24:42| Briefly, because you all have heard this before, variances will be granted only where such special circumstances or conditions exist, such as exceptional narrowness, topography, or siding, as fully described in the findings of the Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=1482)|
| 0:25:02| Variances will not be granted to allow use otherwise excluded from the particular district in which requested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=1502)|
| 0:25:11| The aforesaid circumstances or conditions are such that the strict application of the provisions of the code would deprive the applicant of any reasonable use of their land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=1511)|
| 0:25:23| Mere loss in value does not justify a variance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=1523)|
| 0:25:27| There must be a deprivation of the beneficial use of the land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=1527)|
| 0:25:31| Any variance granted under the provisions of this section must be the minimum adjustment necessary for the reasonable use of the land, and the granting of any variance is in harmony with the general purpose and intent of this code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=1531)|
| 0:25:46| It will not be injurious to the neighborhood, detrimental to the public welfare, or in conflict with the general plan for development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=1546)|
| 0:25:58| As an aside, I have appreciated the professionalism of Mr. Cole, and I listened closely to what he had to say to the members of Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=1558)|
| 0:26:11| However, respectfully, and while my family has had members serve in the military, unfortunately service in the military is not one of the criteria allowed to grant a variance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=1571)|
| 0:26:29| I don't mean to diminish the importance of his service, whether it was abroad or whether it was in Oak Ridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=1589)|
| 0:26:37| However, respectfully, that's not grounds for granting these, what, seven or eight variances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=1597)|
| 0:26:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=1606)|
| 0:26:50| So, what we have before us and what I see from reviewing the packet from the Board of Zoning Appeals is we are here to determine whether a hardship exists, whether there's something specific about the land that created the hardship and the inability to use the land, which does not exist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=1610)|
| 0:27:12| I don't see that we are voting to issue a demolition permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=1632)|
| 0:27:18| What specifically the application says is that we are issuing variances to enable the purchase of the property where the additional structures exist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=1638)|
| 0:27:33| One thing that stood out to me in the transcript from the Board of Zoning Appeals was that the structures are all built on land not owned by the applicant, and that KUB, whose land it is, has already asked some offense to be removed that was additionally further back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=1653)|
| 0:27:57| And that there are safety issues, which is why they won't sell the additional land for the variances or for the additional, for the setbacks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=1677)|
| 0:28:10| I think it's of note the discussion that was made at the Board of Zoning Appeals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=1690)|
| 0:28:17| About the stormwater absorption and the coverage, there's multiple, most of the property is covered in rooftop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=1697)|
| 0:28:29| And these variances are asking us to give setbacks of 1.2 inches for the first one, 1.2 inches for the second one, 4.8 inches for the third one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=1709)|
| 0:28:43| The fourth one is 1.7 feet from the required, so it's from 15 feet to 13 and some feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=1723)|
| 0:28:52| Number five is over a 240% increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=1732)|
| 0:28:58| And so it goes with all eight variances. They're pretty extreme because the structures were on different lands. So.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=1738)|
| 0:29:08| I appreciate Mr. Cole's comments, but they don't meet the standard for a variance, which is stated in the packet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=1748)|
| 0:29:16| Which is why the Board of Zoning Appeals voted 5 to 0 for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=1756)|
| 0:29:21| So, I'm not comfortable setting the precedent of approving this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=1761)|
| 0:29:29| And based on structures that were inherited and built without permits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=1769)|
| 0:29:35| To enable the purchase of property, because that is what is presented to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=1775)|
| 0:29:41| So, on that basis, I would make a motion to disapprove.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=1781)|
| 0:29:48| The request, okay, there's a motion made to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=1788)|
| 0:29:55| Do you mean deny the I'm sorry motion to deny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=1795)|
| 0:30:01| Motion made by council member writer to deny the appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=1801)|
| 0:30:06| Are there any is there a 2nd to the motion? I'll 2nd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=1806)|
| 0:30:11| Motion made by council member writer 2nd by council member Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=1811)|
| 0:30:16| Any further discussion council member Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=1816)|
| 0:30:20| And a question perhaps for Mr. Frost, but.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=1820)|
| 0:30:27| Thinking of the sequence of events, it seems to me that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=1827)|
| 0:30:33| The applicant for this variance is able to apply for that variance before owning the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=1833)|
| 0:30:44| Well, council member Parker, and some circumstances, a property owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=1844)|
| 0:30:53| Might make an application generally speaking to rezone a property before they purchase it, because they want to know that the rezoning goes through before they actually close on the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=1853)|
| 0:31:07| And I believe that before KB will sell the land to Mr. Clark, he must obtain the variances 1st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=1867)|
| 0:31:18| So, KB is willing to sell the land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=1878)|
| 0:31:23| Personally, I don't know. I have not had any conversations with KB.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=1883)|
| 0:31:30| Council member writer. Oh, sorry. Mr. Frost. Did you have more? I was done. Thank you. Mayor. It was actually me and I was going to say, do you want to council member writer knew the answer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=1890)|
| 0:31:42| Yeah, on page 26 of the packet KB and they were 1 of the speakers. So it's in the transcript from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=1902)|
| 0:31:49| They are only willing to sell the land that the structure sits on and nothing more than and.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=1909)|
| 0:31:56| Anything under 5 acres requires replaying and to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=1916)|
| 0:32:02| You have to have you have to have your variances that that was the need for the variances to be able to make the sale go through the property has to be replanted. They can't sell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=1922)|
| 0:32:12| Feet and inches, they have to sell it platted together as 1 and since the structures exist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=1932)|
| 0:32:18| Then, so that's what necessitates the order of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=1938)|
| 0:32:22| Operations, so just to clarify something you said earlier, they would be able to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=1942)|
| 0:32:30| Purchase the property that the structures currently sit on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=1950)|
| 0:32:36| If a variance is granted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=1956)|
| 0:32:40| I wanted to clarify something you're saying earlier that they wouldn't be able to buy the property from because it's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=1960)|
| 0:32:50| I'm not sure if that's what you're saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=1970)|
| 0:32:54| KB found it to be dangerous. That was too close.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=1974)|
| 0:32:59| So, in the transcript from the board of zoning appeals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=1979)|
| 0:33:05| I'll have to go back down through it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=1985)|
| 0:33:09| Easy a package starts on page 24 of our packet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=1989)|
| 0:33:15| It said something in the transcript.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=1995)|
| 0:33:25| Um.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=2005)|
| 0:33:29| When they hold on, let me find there's a speaker from KB.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=2009)|
| 0:33:35| Um, Billy Joe McCarley, this is Billy Joe McCarley with KB and you'd asked a question about the proximity to the tower. There's a tower right behind the garage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=2015)|
| 0:33:44| Our engineers have evaluated the site and we do feel comfortable that the permanent structure can stay and we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=2024)|
| 0:33:50| Stay not in violation of any type of codes. In addition that we still have room to operate, maintain our facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=2030)|
| 0:33:58| There was a fence that was also installed the property and we did ask Mr. Clark to remove that fence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=2038)|
| 0:34:03| Um, the fence cause any safety concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=2043)|
| 0:34:09| Somewhere in the packet or in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=2049)|
| 0:34:12| I think it's, I can't find it at the moment, but it says something about, they will only sell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=2052)|
| 0:34:18| Where the building actually sits and nothing more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=2058)|
| 0:34:22| So, I think in the packet council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=2062)|
| 0:34:27| Um.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=2067)|
| 0:34:30| What page is it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=2070)|
| 0:34:33| Page 42 in the packet. I guess the conversation with Daniel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=2073)|
| 0:34:37| And, um, and Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=2077)|
| 0:34:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=2083)|
| 0:34:46| KB is only willing in my understanding to sell the property that is directly underneath the garage and the carport and the back. And, of course, the existing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=2086)|
| 0:34:56| All structures are existing and those would also be the structures on the existing lot would also need variances as such.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=2096)|
| 0:35:03| So, the situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=2103)|
| 0:35:07| Is that do we start.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=2107)|
| 0:35:11| Of someone building someone, not Mr. Clark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=2111)|
| 0:35:16| If I bought Mr. Clark's property, I would have the same problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=2116)|
| 0:35:20| Of building multiple structures without permits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=2120)|
| 0:35:25| On other people's land, and then ending up in the situation where you could purchase the property that the item sit on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=2125)|
| 0:35:33| If you can get variances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=2133)|
| 0:35:37| Um, and then they discuss.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=2137)|
| 0:35:41| For the required setbacks that are safety issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=2141)|
| 0:35:46| Proximity of buildings to other structures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=2146)|
| 0:35:49| And other people's property lines, and they discuss that as a precedent setting issue in the transcript, which is why I'm inclined to not support and to deny it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=2149)|
| 0:36:01| So, just to clarify.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=2161)|
| 0:36:05| Your arguments and I thank you so much for taking the time to go through that is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=2165)|
| 0:36:10| Because my reading of it is that it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=2170)|
| 0:36:13| It did fit into the hardship request because of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=2173)|
| 0:36:17| Narrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=2177)|
| 0:36:21| Definition of what property would allowed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=2181)|
| 0:36:24| Be allowed to have that variance the fact that it has been in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=2184)|
| 0:36:30| Um, who the property owner is and the hardship that they're experiencing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=2190)|
| 0:36:36| These late years in life, and although this is not a permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=2196)|
| 0:36:41| For demolition, I believe if we do not grant the variances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=2201)|
| 0:36:46| What we're saying is that these structures are not allowed there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=2206)|
| 0:36:50| And ultimately the property owner will likely have to remove the structures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=2210)|
| 0:36:55| And so I, I'm glad this came back before city council, because I feel that the lawyer was able to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=2215)|
| 0:37:05| Help me see what the situation is that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=2225)|
| 0:37:09| But this is a structure last time we met.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=2229)|
| 0:37:12| I wasn't sure if this is something that had been built within the last 10 years. To me, that's a different situation than something that was built 50 years ago and we're simply asking for a variance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=2232)|
| 0:37:24| So those structures can remain not that anything can be expanded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=2244)|
| 0:37:29| So, that's why I'm, I'm inclined to support the appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=2249)|
| 0:37:33| Okay, the motion on the floor is to deny the appeal. It's been made and seconded. Are there any further comments or questions on this motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=2253)|
| 0:37:45| Mr. Swanson, did you have a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=2265)|
| 0:37:49| I just wanted to point out that what the law is with regard to the, to the topography of the land is it's got to be associated with the narrowness or topography or unusual way in which the land lies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=2269)|
| 0:38:02| We have not heard anything in this appeal about some unusual way in which this land lies, or that it's unusually narrow or anything like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=2282)|
| 0:38:10| So, really, we have heard nothing in the appeal itself to suggest a qualification for a variance here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=2290)|
| 0:38:20| There's also some discussion about whether this might be something like a pre-existing nonconforming use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=2300)|
| 0:38:26| It is not a pre-existing nonconforming use because it was illegal when it happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=2306)|
| 0:38:31| And it doesn't matter how long it is. If it was illegal when it started, it stays illegal throughout.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=2311)|
| 0:38:37| So, I just want council to be aware of that situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=2317)|
| 0:38:40| I have a question, Mr. Swanson. Would you not say that there's a generally accepted principle within property law that things are grandfathered in over 50 years?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=2320)|
| 0:38:56| Not for variances, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=2336)|
| 0:39:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=2342)|
| 0:39:05| Thank you, Mr. Swanson. Thank you, Council Member Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=2345)|
| 0:39:09| Council Member Fugate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=2349)|
| 0:39:11| Thank you. This is just a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=2351)|
| 0:39:14| If I understand this correctly, KUV hasn't said he has to tear this down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=2354)|
| 0:39:19| City Codes isn't saying that it has to be torn down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=2359)|
| 0:39:22| It just says that whoever – it will be a problem if he goes to sell the property or his estate goes to sell the property because those buildings will not transfer with the title.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=2362)|
| 0:39:35| But he should be able to continue to have the enjoyment and use of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=2375)|
| 0:39:40| I haven't heard anybody say that they're going to make him tear it down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=2380)|
| 0:39:44| I don't think that was anywhere in the record, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=2384)|
| 0:39:48| Council Member Fugate, if the variances aren't granted and the sale won't go through, that would remain KUV's property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=2388)|
| 0:39:59| And I guess as the property owner, it would be up to KUV what they're going to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=2399)|
| 0:40:05| But they haven't said they're going to do anything at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=2405)|
| 0:40:11| You can't answer that. You're not KUV.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=2411)|
| 0:40:15| I'm just saying that wasn't in the transcripts anywhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=2415)|
| 0:40:18| And I have not spoken with KUV.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=2418)|
| 0:40:21| Nor should you. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=2421)|
| 0:40:24| Council Member Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=2424)|
| 0:40:26| I'll be quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=2426)|
| 0:40:28| I'll just say that in the transcript from BZA, the KUV representative specifically said the existing building does not pose a problem for their transformer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=2428)|
| 0:40:37| So I'll take them at that word.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=2437)|
| 0:40:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=2440)|
| 0:40:42| Thank you, Council Member Fugate and Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=2442)|
| 0:40:45| Council Member Testerman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=2445)|
| 0:40:48| So on that note, and I remember asking Director Aarons, I think, when this was before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=2448)|
| 0:40:56| If we don't overturn this and grant the variances, will the city then pursue a demolition permit or request that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=2456)|
| 0:41:10| And I felt like I heard that when this was before us before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=2470)|
| 0:41:16| I mean, I'm struggling with this as well, given the longevity that these structures have been there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=2476)|
| 0:41:24| There hasn't been any opposition from the neighbors or surrounding landowners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=2484)|
| 0:41:29| KUV has seemed to, you know, wanting to compromise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=2489)|
| 0:41:37| So my concern would be, would the city pursue this property owner, Mr. Clark, to demolish the current structures?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=2497)|
| 0:41:50| I don't think we can answer that question at this time, because at this point, there's been no complaint filed about the existence of the structure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=2510)|
| 0:41:59| There's just been the request for these variances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=2519)|
| 0:42:02| We don't have enough enforcement capacity to go out and enforce these types of things without a complaint as a general rule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=2522)|
| 0:42:11| And so it doesn't come to our attention and we don't enforce it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=2531)|
| 0:42:14| In this situation, again, there's been no complaint filed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=2534)|
| 0:42:19| But if a complaint should be filed, I don't think that we can say that we won't require the structure to be removed, because that's what the law would require.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=2539)|
| 0:42:26| If somebody complains and we come in and they ask us to enforce the law, we're not going to tell you in advance that we're not going to enforce the law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=2546)|
| 0:42:36| Would the only complainant potentially be KUV?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=2556)|
| 0:42:40| They're certainly a neighbor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=2560)|
| 0:42:42| They're the they're the bordering property owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=2562)|
| 0:42:44| They would be the logical complainant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=2564)|
| 0:42:46| But I can't I mean, it doesn't we don't limit complaints to just a neighbor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=2566)|
| 0:42:51| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=2571)|
| 0:42:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=2572)|
| 0:42:53| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=2573)|
| 0:42:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=2574)|
| 0:42:55| Thank you, Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=2575)|
| 0:42:57| Councilmember.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=2577)|
| 0:43:00| Did you have more questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=2580)|
| 0:43:02| No, I think that's a.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=2582)|
| 0:43:05| Vice Mayor McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=2585)|
| 0:43:07| I have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=2587)|
| 0:43:08| So in the event that Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=2588)|
| 0:43:09| Clark needed to sell his property to provide for his care, would would us denying this impede his ability to be able to sell his property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=2589)|
| 0:43:24| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=2604)|
| 0:43:26| And, you know, that that would be that would be a title lawyer question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=2606)|
| 0:43:30| And I'm I've never been a title lawyer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=2610)|
| 0:43:33| Might try that in my next career.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=2613)|
| 0:43:35| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=2615)|
| 0:43:36| I mean, based on what's been presented, I would I would gather that it would be it would be an issue to a certain degree because they'd have to go back through this this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=2616)|
| 0:43:47| It's some it appears to me at some juncture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=2627)|
| 0:43:55| So I think that's a little concerning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=2635)|
| 0:43:59| If that would come into play and the ability for him to be able to sell his his his property in a timely manner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=2639)|
| 0:44:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=2651)|
| 0:44:12| Vice Mayor McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=2652)|
| 0:44:13| Councilmember Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=2653)|
| 0:44:14| Just to clarify, Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=2654)|
| 0:44:15| Swanson, is it possible for someone to purchase this land without the variances?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=2655)|
| 0:44:25| I think that's possible to purchase the land without the variances, whether a purchaser is going to be willing to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=2665)|
| 0:44:31| But I don't know, because there may be some problem with title insurance when you're encroaching upon someone else's land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=2671)|
| 0:44:38| So, again, those are those are questions, appropriate questions for a title lawyer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=2678)|
| 0:44:43| And I would defer that to someone else who has more expertise than I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=2683)|
| 0:44:48| But if along those lines, Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=2688)|
| 0:44:51| Clark was able to purchase the property if with these structures already on there, if they preceded him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=2691)|
| 0:44:57| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=2697)|
| 0:44:58| Say that again, I didn't really understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=2698)|
| 0:45:00| Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=2700)|
| 0:45:01| Clark was able to purchase the land with these structures already on them to begin with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=2701)|
| 0:45:04| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=2704)|
| 0:45:05| I think he inherited with the structures already on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=2705)|
| 0:45:08| I think maybe those structures got created when his mother.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=2708)|
| 0:45:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=2711)|
| 0:45:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=2714)|
| 0:45:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=2717)|
| 0:45:20| I'm calling on you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=2720)|
| 0:45:23| Yep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=2723)|
| 0:45:24| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=2724)|
| 0:45:25| I think actually this could create good precedent for, you know, members of the community that have disputes, property disputes to come together and find the resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=2725)|
| 0:45:39| And they're relying on us to kind of acknowledge that resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=2739)|
| 0:45:46| You know, KUV's asked that if they're going to keep those structures, well, I can't say it in that way, but has asked that the property be purchased that the structures are under.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=2746)|
| 0:45:58| The property owner is taking the steps and has said they did not know that they were building on someone else's property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=2758)|
| 0:46:10| And that's hard to verify 50 years later, but it seems also in our processes, we should have some sort of grace for those who might have made mistakes and are now working to remedy those mistakes, have worked with the other parties involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=2770)|
| 0:46:26| We have no other complainants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=2786)|
| 0:46:30| I don't think that this encourages folks to just build property illegally on other people's property, but perhaps encourages, you know, the parties involved to find those resolutions and then seek tools within the city to help them resolve those issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=2790)|
| 0:46:52| Mr. Cole is seeking recognition if a member of council wishes to address or call on him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=2812)|
| 0:46:58| Council, would you like to hear from Mr. Cole?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=2818)|
| 0:47:01| He's available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=2821)|
| 0:47:03| Mr. Cole, would you unmute him please, Mr. Johnson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=2823)|
| 0:47:09| Mr. Cole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=2829)|
| 0:47:11| Mayor, I was going to respond to some of the questions that many of the representatives had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=2831)|
| 0:47:18| However, I believe they have all been properly answered as to sale of this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=2838)|
| 0:47:25| For what that's worth, I was involved in a state some years ago that was trying to sell an old gas station that had an environmental problem because the tanks leaked and we couldn't give the property away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=2845)|
| 0:47:40| And I imagine until all of these variance items are corrected or taken care of, it would be difficult for that to be sold because of residential disclosures and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=2860)|
| 0:47:56| The purchaser would know that they were purchasing something that was going to be a financial headache.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=2876)|
| 0:48:07| Council Member Rodger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=2887)|
| 0:48:10| Is Mr. Ahrens on the call?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=2890)|
| 0:48:13| And we could ask him a question or I could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=2893)|
| 0:48:16| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=2896)|
| 0:48:18| Mr. Ahrens, is there anything you could add to the conversation when we have a situation or how often do we see a situation where things are done illegally?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=2898)|
| 0:48:32| I'm not pointing a finger at anyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=2912)|
| 0:48:34| I don't know who built them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=2914)|
| 0:48:36| They predate the current title holder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=2916)|
| 0:48:39| But they're built illegally and they don't meet the standards and they require variances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=2919)|
| 0:48:45| It's like a created hardship.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=2925)|
| 0:48:47| And isn't that something that sometimes ends up at the Board of Zoning Appeals?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=2927)|
| 0:48:53| Yes, ma'am, it does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=2933)|
| 0:48:56| It does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=2936)|
| 0:48:58| It does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=2938)|
| 0:49:00| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=2940)|
| 0:49:02| And not to speak for the Board of Zoning Appeals, but I've heard the term seeking forgiveness as something that's thrown around every once in a while in BZA as opposed to and when you're seeking forgiveness, that would mean asking for the variance after you've already created the issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=2942)|
| 0:49:24| So I'm not speaking for the Board of Zoning Appeals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=2964)|
| 0:49:29| I'm speaking historically and consistent with how this BZA has ruled that was a created hardship versus something that is identified in Article 16 of the code as a legitimate hardship.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=2969)|
| 0:49:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=2985)|
| 0:49:47| I want a clarification, if I may.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=2987)|
| 0:49:52| So even though it was something that was done inappropriately, it was not necessarily something that he did not necessarily create this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=2992)|
| 0:50:05| He inherited this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=3005)|
| 0:50:07| And it sounds like unknowingly, I'm sure it sounds like maybe his family members might not have been aware either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=3007)|
| 0:50:14| So I guess I just want, is that a true statement that he inherited the land and inherited this issue?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=3014)|
| 0:50:26| Are you asking Mr. Aarons?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=3026)|
| 0:50:30| Mr. Aarons or either?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=3030)|
| 0:50:33| Mr. Cole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=3033)|
| 0:50:35| Mr. Cole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=3035)|
| 0:50:38| This is Peter Aarons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=3038)|
| 0:50:41| I can just say that the property assessor's office has Mr. Bill Clark purchasing on 72981 3308 Barton Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=3041)|
| 0:50:57| And so I'm not sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=3057)|
| 0:50:58| And I can, if you look at KGIS and the historical aerials, many of these structures appeared after that date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=3058)|
| 0:51:07| So I don't know exactly if he inherited all of them or what the situation is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=3067)|
| 0:51:16| So, based on KGIS, the title to the property change names in 1981.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=3076)|
| 0:51:26| So, it was able to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=3086)|
| 0:51:29| The title of the property was, it was possible for the title to change names.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=3089)|
| 0:51:37| What I can say is I've been speaking to council as a non-council member and been a council member with an understanding of what a hardship is and how the Board of Zoning Appeals interprets that and what that means in terms of if it moves past our bodies towards a court of law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=3097)|
| 0:51:57| And what I am making my vote on is not how I feel about the applicant, who they are, where they came from, what they've done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=3117)|
| 0:52:05| I have to look at it and apply it evenly as I would apply it to any person A, B, or C.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=3125)|
| 0:52:12| I hear and I think everybody brings up great points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=3132)|
| 0:52:17| I'm not voting for the garage to be demolished and that wasn't mentioned in any of the transcript.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=3137)|
| 0:52:24| It's the next person and the next person, the next person across our city are depending on us to interpret the laws that we have on the books evenly and the same and consistently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=3144)|
| 0:52:37| And that's why my motion is based as it is. And so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=3157)|
| 0:52:40| I'm going to stick with that. I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=3160)|
| 0:52:45| Thank you council member writer any further questions or discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=3165)|
| 0:52:52| I just wanted to add on to that that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=3172)|
| 0:52:59| context matters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=3179)|
| 0:53:02| I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=3182)|
| 0:53:07| sometimes when we try to make what we think is a fair blanket application of the law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=3187)|
| 0:53:17| We don't understand the full context.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=3197)|
| 0:53:22| And maybe we even apply our own context to their context.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=3202)|
| 0:53:30| And so I think that I think it's important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=3210)|
| 0:53:34| And this situation I did have a question another question for Peter and with that hardship definition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=3214)|
| 0:53:49| You know that created hardship.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=3229)|
| 0:53:55| So, is that just a blanket definition or does. Is there any context there, like in terms of if the, you know, structures are 6050 40 years old versus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=3235)|
| 0:54:09| They were built two years ago and now they want a variance. I'm curious about how, how it's been applied and if there have been a lot of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=3249)|
| 0:54:21| I think I understand what you're asking and from my experience the answer would be no, they have not recognized the longevity of an illegal structure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=3261)|
| 0:54:44| They've, they've looked at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=3284)|
| 0:54:46| They've looked at each situation and applied each situation to the ordinances that they're, they're, they're required to uphold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=3286)|
| 0:55:01| So, the.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=3301)|
| 0:55:03| So, their definition of a self created hardship is simply if the structure exists before the variance is created and it's self created.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=3303)|
| 0:55:17| They would look at it. I would word it this way. If, if I were to go and build something without obtaining the appropriate permits, and I've created a hardship.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=3317)|
| 0:55:26| They have looked at that differently than if I'm planning for a project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=3326)|
| 0:55:32| And I recognize that. Hey, I've got a sinkhole in my backyard and I need to move this structure closer to the property line to stay away from that sinkhole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=3332)|
| 0:55:42| They have absolutely recognized that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=3342)|
| 0:55:45| I can remember a similar situation where there was a structure that was seeking a side yard setback variance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=3345)|
| 0:55:55| And the structure just showed up without permits. We got a complaint about it. We followed through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=3355)|
| 0:56:02| They went to the board and they provided evidence. They said, we have a sinkhole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=3362)|
| 0:56:07| So, we had to shift the structure to the side and the board recognized that hardship.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=3367)|
| 0:56:13| And so they granted the variance and the applicant was able to proceed with legalizing the structure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=3373)|
| 0:56:22| So, it sounds like this situation actually doesn't fit into the self-created hardship definition because the applicant did not build the structures himself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=3382)|
| 0:56:34| Do we, maybe it seems like Mr. Swanson has a comment that might add clarity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=3394)|
| 0:56:45| We call it self-created hardship. What it really is, is human being created hardship.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=3405)|
| 0:56:50| What the law requires is that the hardship be related to the actual siting of the land, the topography, the narrowness, the slope, whatever it may be, a natural condition that occurs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=3410)|
| 0:57:05| Something that is created by human beings cannot be utilized to create a hardship.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=3425)|
| 0:57:09| It's not part of the definition of hardship. It's actually excluded from the definition of hardship.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=3429)|
| 0:57:15| There's case law that goes back years and years and years, which indicates that you cannot create a hardship or inherit someone else's creation of a hardship.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=3435)|
| 0:57:29| It can't be a human being related situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=3449)|
| 0:57:32| It's got to be a natural topography type situation to entitle you to a hardship under the narrow definition of what you're entitled to as a variance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=3452)|
| 0:57:43| Thank you. Council Member Testimone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=3463)|
| 0:57:47| Council Member Testimone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=3467)|
| 0:57:54| Thank you. So, I'm a little confused now, just based on what Director Aaron said, and I'm looking for some chronology here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=3474)|
| 0:58:03| So, we've heard 50 years, and then, but we heard that he took over the property and the title transferred in 1981, and that those structures were then built post-1981.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=3483)|
| 0:58:19| So, that timeline isn't, so did Mr. Clark build those structures, or were they already existing when he assumed the title?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=3499)|
| 0:58:30| Ms. Rutter, do you have an answer to that question by chance, or does Mr. Aaron's, Mr. Carl, about the timeline question from Council Member Testimone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=3510)|
| 0:58:44| Well, it appears from looking at KGIS areals, the historical areals, that if you look at 2007,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=3524)|
| 0:58:55| there's a difference and a structure added in that area, I'm sorry, in that timeframe. So, if you look at the 2003 areal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=3535)|
| 0:59:06| and then you look at the 2007 areal, structures were added. So, my question to relate to that is Mr. Clark purchased this property, or it became titled in his name in 1981.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=3546)|
| 0:59:25| So, based on what we are presented with, the change from 2003 to 2007, it's pretty straightforward to deduce that these structures were built by Mr. Clark, or someone came and built them on his land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=3565)|
| 0:59:42| Maybe someone else paid for them, but based on the records that we have, there were no permits for them, and we're being asked to grant a variance for the amount of coverage there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=3582)|
| 0:59:53| So, it didn't all get inherited. It changed, and I'm looking at the areal 2003 to 2007.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=3593)|
| 1:00:05| Okay. Council Member Singh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=3605)|
| 1:00:08| Thank you. This is a bit confusing. It seems like if we deny the variances, the structures are there, unless somebody makes a complaint, they will stay there, because it seems like KUB is fine with them there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=3608)|
| 1:00:29| The issue would really change when he went to sell it. Does that sound correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=3629)|
| 1:00:42| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=3642)|
| 1:00:43| Mr. Swanson, could you speak to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=3643)|
| 1:00:46| As I mentioned before, we just can't assure you that the city is not going to enforce the law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=3646)|
| 1:00:51| The law in this circumstance would say that this is an illegal structure, and we can't assure you that we're not going to enforce the law with regard to an illegal structure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=3651)|
| 1:01:01| I don't know that there's any pressing motivation for us to go out and enforce that now in the absence of a complaint, but we can't give you some continuing assurance that ultimately he's not going to be required to comply with the law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=3661)|
| 1:01:19| Okay. Thank you, Mr. Singh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=3679)|
| 1:01:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=3681)|
| 1:01:22| Any further questions or comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=3682)|
| 1:01:26| Another question for Mr. Swanson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=3686)|
| 1:01:37| Just in reviewing the law, I'm really concerned with how limited it seems to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=3697)|
| 1:01:47| What would be our process, since we're lawmakers, for amending that and making it so that there is some sort of no-fault claim within there that allows for variance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=3707)|
| 1:02:08| That allows for someone to inherit land, they didn't know, had issues with it, and receive the variance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=3728)|
| 1:02:21| What would the process be for this body to be able to do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=3741)|
| 1:02:25| Is there a connection to the state law?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=3745)|
| 1:02:27| I'm sorry. I didn't mean to interrupt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=3747)|
| 1:02:30| I guess technically the process would be to create an amended ordinance with regard to variances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=3750)|
| 1:02:38| But you need to know that the definition of variance is a definition that's contained in state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=3758)|
| 1:02:44| And we have very limited ability to depart from state law with regard to what may be considered as an appropriate variance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=3764)|
| 1:02:52| So we would have to do some investigating and some legal research as to whether we could bring an ordinance that is an ordinance, as you suggest, that provides some level of forgiveness, either after a period of time or whatever it may be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=3772)|
| 1:03:10| I don't think we're ever going to pass an ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=3790)|
| 1:03:13| I hope we're not going to pass an ordinance that permits illegal uses, no matter how long they've been there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=3793)|
| 1:03:20| Because there's a reason why you prohibit illegal uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=3800)|
| 1:03:24| Just one other add-on question would be for this specific situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=3804)|
| 1:03:30| Now I'm forgetting my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=3810)|
| 1:03:36| Council Member Parker, Council Member Fugate has been, if you've done, need a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=3816)|
| 1:03:44| She's been waiting to speak to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=3824)|
| 1:03:47| I just remembered it and I might forget it again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=3827)|
| 1:03:50| If a variance is not an option, what are other options that this body has to keep those structures from becoming illegal structures?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=3830)|
| 1:04:04| And we then have to enforce the law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=3844)|
| 1:04:09| Can we, Mr. Frost?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=3849)|
| 1:04:12| There are already illegal structures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=3852)|
| 1:04:14| So I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=3854)|
| 1:04:15| I don't know of a method you might have to keep them from being an illegal structure other than to change the law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=3855)|
| 1:04:23| On variances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=3863)|
| 1:04:26| Thank you, Mr. Fugate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=3866)|
| 1:04:30| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=3870)|
| 1:04:31| Mayor, I'd like to call the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=3871)|
| 1:04:33| With all due respect, I think what we have to do is decide based on the law as it is now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=3873)|
| 1:04:39| So I'd like to call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=3879)|
| 1:04:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=3883)|
| 1:04:44| Call for the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=3884)|
| 1:04:46| So that means we vote on whether to end debate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=3886)|
| 1:04:51| It's really only necessary if there's other people seeking recognition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=3891)|
| 1:04:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=3895)|
| 1:04:57| Mayor, the motion to call the question is a priority motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=3897)|
| 1:05:02| There is no debating the motion to call the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=3902)|

| 1:17:58| Seconded by Council Member Fugate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=4678)|
| 1:18:01| Council Members, I just want to preface| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=4681)|
| 1:18:03| your conversation with this by saying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=4683)|
| 1:18:05| that I'm really excited about this investment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=4685)|
| 1:18:08| that this represents in our economy and in our workforce.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=4688)|
| 1:18:12| Fraley and Schilling already have a presence in Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=4692)|
| 1:18:15| and now they're interested in growing their investment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=4695)|
| 1:18:18| in our community through a $2.4 million facility expansion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=4698)|
| 1:18:23| and by adding over 100 new quality jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=4703)|
| 1:18:27| And these jobs will have salaries and wages| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=4707)|
| 1:18:29| on an average of $55,000 to $70,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=4709)|
| 1:18:33| and it's in East Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=4713)|
| 1:18:34| So I really appreciate the work of our team| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=4714)|
| 1:18:37| as well as our partners at the Knoxville Chamber| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=4717)|
| 1:18:39| and the Industrial Development Board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=4719)|
| 1:18:41| and I hope you will support this resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=4721)|
| 1:18:44| Any questions or comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=4724)|
| 1:18:47| Jen, Ms. Tesserman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=4727)|
| 1:18:50| I just wanted to say just kind of in reading this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=4730)|
| 1:18:53| and I know this is one of the first pilots| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=4733)|
| 1:18:55| that Council has received, especially new Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=4735)|
| 1:18:59| My understanding is that Council over the years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=4739)|
| 1:19:04| or at least these Council members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=4744)|
| 1:19:06| have never really done a workshop on pilots and TIFs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=4746)|
| 1:19:09| and so I was gonna ask Vice Mayor McKenzie| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=4749)|
| 1:19:13| and propose to see if we could consider doing a workshop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=4753)|
| 1:19:18| on pilots and TIFs to better understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=4758)|
| 1:19:20| as they come our way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=4760)|
| 1:19:24| because they can certainly be complicated issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=4764)|
| 1:19:26| but I just wanted to propose that while we're discussing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=4766)|
| 1:19:30| Absolutely, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=4770)|
| 1:19:32| Thank you, Council Member Tesserman| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=4772)|
| 1:19:34| and Vice Mayor McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=4774)|
| 1:19:35| Council Member Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=4775)|
| 1:19:37| Yeah, I was wondering if Deputy Director Welch| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=4777)|
| 1:19:41| or if Ms. Foster was on the call| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=4781)|
| 1:19:44| and could maybe give us a little bit of detail| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=4784)|
| 1:19:46| about this pilot is a little different| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=4786)|
| 1:19:50| than anything that's been before Council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=4790)|
| 1:19:52| while I've been on Council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=4792)|
| 1:19:54| and specifically of interest to me is the callback schedule| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=4794)|
| 1:19:59| which is also different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=4799)|
| 1:20:00| So if they could speak to that for us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=4800)|
| 1:20:03| that would be great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=4803)|
| 1:20:04| Ms. Welch, could you address the question from Council?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=4804)|
| 1:20:07| Yes, thank you, thank you, Mayor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=4807)|
| 1:20:09| and thank you, Council Member Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=4809)|
| 1:20:11| Can you all hear me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=4811)|
| 1:20:12| Great, thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=4812)|
| 1:20:14| So thank you for the question, Council Member Ryder| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=4814)|
| 1:20:17| and also I know that you had an opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=4817)|
| 1:20:20| to go out and visit the site| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=4820)|
| 1:20:21| so thanks for your engagement on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=4821)|
| 1:20:24| So this is a little bit different| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=4824)|
| 1:20:26| from the development style pilots| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=4826)|
| 1:20:30| that this Council has seen before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=4830)|
| 1:20:32| This is a jobs pilot or an economic development pilot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=4832)|
| 1:20:37| This company, as the Mayor indicated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=4837)|
| 1:20:40| already has a presence in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=4840)|
| 1:20:44| They've been working with the Chamber| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=4844)|
| 1:20:46| for the last little bit of time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=4846)|
| 1:20:48| and I'm thankful Doug Lawyer's on the phone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=4848)|
| 1:20:51| as is Todd Napier and Mr. White from Fraley and Schilling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=4851)|
| 1:20:56| They were interested in this expansion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=4856)|
| 1:20:59| and not just their facility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=4859)|
| 1:21:00| but I think what's of greatest interest to us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=4860)|
| 1:21:02| is that they are very interested| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=4862)|
| 1:21:05| in adding over 100 really high quality jobs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=4865)|
| 1:21:09| and that doesn't only benefit those individuals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=4869)|
| 1:21:13| who get those jobs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=4873)|
| 1:21:18| but that's a big benefit to our economy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=4878)|
| 1:21:20| So there's a return on investment to the individual| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=4880)|
| 1:21:23| and to the overall community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=4883)|
| 1:21:25| So those are some of the factors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=4885)|
| 1:21:27| that we looked at as a city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=4887)|
| 1:21:29| in working with the Chamber and with the City IDB| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=4889)|
| 1:21:33| in evaluating this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=4893)|
| 1:21:35| As you indicated, Councilman Ryder,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=4895)|
| 1:21:38| there is also an accountability factor here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=4898)|
| 1:21:41| that I think is really important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=4901)|
| 1:21:42| So as the City IDB moves forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=4902)|
| 1:21:46| with the agreement with Fraley and Schilling,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=4906)|
| 1:21:51| there will be a clawback provision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=4911)|
| 1:21:52| that includes not only the number of jobs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=4912)|
| 1:21:56| and if they don't hit the mark on the number of jobs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=4916)|
| 1:21:59| then the tax abatement is scaled back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=4919)|
| 1:22:03| but also on the wages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=4923)|
| 1:22:04| So again, it's really important to us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=4924)|
| 1:22:07| I know it is to you on Council and to Fraley and Schilling| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=4927)|
| 1:22:11| that these are high quality jobs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=4931)|
| 1:22:13| and that that average salary and wage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=4933)|
| 1:22:16| is not just competitive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=4936)|
| 1:22:18| but that it actually exceeds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=4938)|
| 1:22:21| both the median household income| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=4941)|
| 1:22:23| and per capita income in our community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=4943)|
| 1:22:25| which I think says a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=4945)|
| 1:22:29| Thank you, Ms. Welch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=4949)|
| 1:22:31| Any further questions or comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=4951)|
| 1:22:33| And just as a side note, of course,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=4953)|
| 1:22:35| I'm eager to help whatever you all want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=4955)|
| 1:22:40| on a workshop on pilots and TIFs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=4960)|
| 1:22:44| as Council Member Testerman was suggesting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=4964)|
| 1:22:46| I think that's a great idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=4966)|
| 1:22:47| So Vice Mayor McKenzie and I can work on finding a time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=4967)|
| 1:22:53| finding a time that works for Council to make that happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=4973)|
| 1:22:56| Council Member Singh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=4976)|
| 1:22:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=4978)|
| 1:22:59| Deputy Mayor Welch, would you mind repeating the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=4979)|
| 1:23:03| you had said it's not just a benefit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=4983)|
| 1:23:04| to the people getting the jobs but also to the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=4984)|
| 1:23:07| Would you repeat that part, what it's doing there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=4987)|
| 1:23:10| Sure, I mean, as we have new high quality jobs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=4990)|
| 1:23:13| come into our community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=4993)|
| 1:23:15| yeah, thank you, Council Member Singh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=4995)|
| 1:23:16| I mean, that is an infusion of dollars into our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=4996)|
| 1:23:22| With these really quality wages| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=5002)|
| 1:23:27| in addition to the capital commitment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=5007)|
| 1:23:31| that they're making through building out their facility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=5011)|
| 1:23:34| which will generate additional tax revenue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=5014)|
| 1:23:37| for the city of Knoxville and for Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=5017)|
| 1:23:39| So we see a couple of different things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=5019)|
| 1:23:43| And then I'll just add that I'm really grateful| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=5023)|
| 1:23:46| for the chamber leading the way with a strategy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=5026)|
| 1:23:51| You've heard about Path to Prosperity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=5031)|
| 1:23:54| which is focused on strengthening| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=5034)|
| 1:23:56| and growing our economic ecosystem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=5036)|
| 1:24:00| So by retaining and expanding their business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=5040)|
| 1:24:04| it is an investment in our community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=5044)|
| 1:24:06| and it builds on the existing strength| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=5046)|
| 1:24:08| that we have around mobility and transportation logistics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=5048)|
| 1:24:12| So we see it as a community win| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=5052)|
| 1:24:15| and as a win to the individuals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=5055)|
| 1:24:18| who will be gaining some really good employment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=5058)|
| 1:24:22| And then there were also some differences on the pilot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=5062)|
| 1:24:25| It's not a 100%, it was 60-40.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=5065)|
| 1:24:30| Could you talk about that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=5070)|
| 1:24:32| Correct, and yes, thanks again, a good question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=5072)|
| 1:24:36| And I'll lean on Todd Napier here as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=5076)|
| 1:24:40| who helped us run that through a formula| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=5080)|
| 1:24:43| so that we really understand the best ratio| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=5083)|
| 1:24:48| to use with that pilot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=5088)|
| 1:24:50| So unlike previous pilots that you've seen on council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=5090)|
| 1:24:54| which are focused again on building and development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=5094)|
| 1:24:58| which typically are at 100% tax abatement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=5098)|
| 1:25:02| we were able to look at this through a 60% tax abatement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=5102)|
| 1:25:09| which basically means that as soon| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=5109)|
| 1:25:11| as the property is reassessed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=5111)|
| 1:25:14| the city and the county both will begin receiving| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=5114)|
| 1:25:17| a higher number of tax dollars on this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=5117)|
| 1:25:22| They will pay in 40% of the reassessed new tax amount| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=5122)|
| 1:25:30| that will be due on this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=5130)|
| 1:25:34| I think this is the first pilot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=5134)|
| 1:25:37| that we've had on council this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=5137)|
| 1:25:39| And I do appreciate the negotiations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=5139)|
| 1:25:41| that were put into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=5141)|
| 1:25:43| I do want to make a request that the next pilots| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=5143)|
| 1:25:46| or TIFs that come up, I'd like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=5146)|
| 1:25:48| I know for myself and I'm sure other council members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=5148)|
| 1:25:51| would like to see it as soon as possible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=5151)|
| 1:25:53| so that it can be something that's discussed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=5153)|
| 1:25:55| with the neighbors in the community as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=5155)|
| 1:25:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=5159)|
| 1:26:02| Heard that, and we'll try to follow up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=5162)|
| 1:26:05| and get it to you sooner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=5165)|
| 1:26:07| Councilor McKenzie, and then Councilor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=5167)|
| 1:26:09| Yes, a question for the chamber.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=5169)|
| 1:26:12| Just want to ensure that all avenues will be exhausted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=5172)|
| 1:26:16| to make sure that the job opportunities are listed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=5176)|
| 1:26:21| to organizations that will meet the needs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=5181)|
| 1:26:24| and especially touch minority, the minority community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=5184)|
| 1:26:27| So if you could maybe confirm that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=5187)|
| 1:26:29| or just talk a little bit about what that strategy is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=5189)|
| 1:26:31| if you have that already plotted out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=5191)|
| 1:26:34| Sure thing, and this is Doug Lawyer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=5194)|
| 1:26:38| with the Knoxville Chamber.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=5198)|
| 1:26:39| Can everybody hear me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=5199)|
| 1:26:40| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=5200)|
| 1:26:41| Okay, yeah, so typically what we do with any,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=5201)|
| 1:26:45| whether it's a retention expansion project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=5205)|
| 1:26:48| like we're talking here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=5208)|
| 1:26:49| or a new business attraction project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=5209)|
| 1:26:51| we will work closely with Fraley and Schilling| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=5211)|
| 1:26:54| to make sure that they register all of these available jobs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=5214)|
| 1:26:57| with the State's Department of Labor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=5217)|
| 1:27:00| the American Job Center is a strong partner of ours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=5220)|
| 1:27:04| We will also help to push that information out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=5224)|
| 1:27:07| to various groups such as the Urban League,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=5227)|
| 1:27:10| Centro Hispano, whichever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=5230)|
| 1:27:12| all these partner agencies that the chamber works with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=5232)|
| 1:27:16| and then to help get that word out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=5236)|
| 1:27:20| And another point about this project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=5240)|
| 1:27:23| that's really exciting is Fraley and Schilling| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=5243)|
| 1:27:26| already has partnerships| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=5246)|
| 1:27:27| with the University of Tennessee's Logistics School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=5247)|
| 1:27:32| The Tennessee College of Applied Technology| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=5252)|
| 1:27:34| also is doing truck driver training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=5254)|
| 1:27:36| So that's another connection that we will work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=5256)|
| 1:27:39| to establish and strengthen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=5259)|
| 1:27:41| with this expansion here in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=5261)|
| 1:27:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=5264)|
| 1:27:46| Thank you, Mr. Lawyer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=5266)|
| 1:27:47| Any for, oh, Mr. Thomas, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=5267)|
| 1:27:49| Yeah, obviously we need to scrutinize each pilot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=5269)|
| 1:27:52| as they come before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=5272)|
| 1:27:54| One thing that really impresses me about this one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=5274)|
| 1:27:57| is there's not 100% abatement from the get-go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=5277)|
| 1:28:00| I mean, we're gonna get a 40% increase on taxes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=5280)|
| 1:28:04| from that property immediately| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=5284)|
| 1:28:06| and then a promise of greater returns later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=5286)|
| 1:28:10| So I'm particularly impressed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=5290)|
| 1:28:12| with the way this one is structured.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=5292)|
| 1:28:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=5294)|
| 1:28:16| Thank you, Council Member Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=5296)|
| 1:28:17| Council Member Rodger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=5297)|
| 1:28:19| I was just wondering, I believe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=5299)|
| 1:28:21| is there someone on the call from Fraley and Schilling| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=5301)|
| 1:28:23| that could give us a little bit of information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=5303)|
| 1:28:25| about your business, who you are?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=5305)|
| 1:28:29| And I know I had the opportunity to meet with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=5309)|
| 1:28:34| This is out on Straw Plains in the 4th District,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=5314)|
| 1:28:37| but others might like to hear a little bit about you guys| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=5317)|
| 1:28:41| and also the different types of jobs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=5321)|
| 1:28:43| that are there at the location and to be added.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=5323)|
| 1:28:49| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=5329)|
| 1:28:50| I think someone's on the line from the business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=5330)|
| 1:28:55| from Fraley and Schilling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=5335)|
| 1:28:57| I'm not sure who to recognize, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=5337)|
| 1:29:00| If I could raise their hand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=5340)|
| 1:29:02| Andy White is the CFO with Fraley and Schilling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=5342)|
| 1:29:04| This is Doug with the Chamber,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=5344)|
| 1:29:06| but I believe Andy is on the phone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=5346)|
| 1:29:07| Mr. White, Andy White, are you on the call?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=5347)|
| 1:29:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=5355)|
| 1:29:16| Mayor, I'll enable him to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=5356)|
| 1:29:16| He needs to unmute himself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=5356)|
| 1:29:18| Hello?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=5358)|
| 1:29:18| Yes, can you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=5358)|
| 1:29:20| Hi there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=5360)|
| 1:29:20| You can just start by stating your name and address| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=5360)|
| 1:29:23| so we all know who you are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=5363)|
| 1:29:26| Andrew White, and I'm the CFO.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=5366)|
| 1:29:29| I'm located at 1920 South State Road 3| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=5369)|
| 1:29:33| in Rushfield, Indiana, at our headquarters currently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=5373)|
| 1:29:38| Give you a little bit of a background| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=5378)|
| 1:29:40| about Fraley and Schilling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=5380)|
| 1:29:40| It was started in 1955.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=5380)|
| 1:29:45| It had mainly a presence across I-70| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=5385)|
| 1:29:48| for the first 25, 30 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=5388)|
| 1:29:51| but in 1990, it started a program of innovation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=5391)|
| 1:29:55| and sustainability leadership in the carrier industry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=5395)|
| 1:30:01| We have developed, by working with tractor manufacturers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=5401)|
| 1:30:08| and trailer manufacturers, the ability to make wider,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=5408)|
| 1:30:11| safer, and more ergonomic equipment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=5411)|
| 1:30:16| that is safer and more fuel efficient in halls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=5416)|
| 1:30:21| Everybody has an 80,000 pound limit without permits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=5421)|
| 1:30:24| but we can haul substantially more than our competitors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=5424)|
| 1:30:27| in all kinds of trailers that we are using.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=5427)|
| 1:30:32| We also use 10 tires instead of 18 tires.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=5432)|
| 1:30:37| They're a little different design on them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=5437)|
| 1:30:39| so there's less tire manufacturing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=5439)|
| 1:30:41| But we've brought that sustainability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=5441)|
| 1:30:44| and innovation leadership, and after 2008 and nine,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=5444)|
| 1:30:49| it really expanded, which is where we started| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=5449)|
| 1:30:51| doing business in Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=5451)|
| 1:30:55| We bought a piece of property in Alcoa,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=5455)|
| 1:30:58| and we started with two employees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=5458)|
| 1:31:00| and we grew to about 30 in about two years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=5460)|
| 1:31:03| Then we bought the Strawberry Plains property in 2014,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=5463)|
| 1:31:08| and we currently have 200 people working| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=5468)|
| 1:31:12| out of that location, of which 50 of those are technicians,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=5472)|
| 1:31:18| and working in our administrative functions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=5478)|
| 1:31:21| The type of functions that we envision in this site| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=5481)|
| 1:31:24| is human resources, recruiting, training, operations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=5484)|
| 1:31:31| We'll be taking our current facility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=5491)|
| 1:31:33| and turning it into a training operation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=5493)|
| 1:31:35| not only for our Tennessee drivers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=5495)|
| 1:31:40| but for all of our operations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=5500)|
| 1:31:43| We have facilities both here in Russville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=5503)|
| 1:31:46| in Ohio, in South Carolina, in Alabama,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=5506)|
| 1:31:52| as well as a few other places.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=5512)|
| 1:31:55| We certainly appreciate Doug, a lawyer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=5515)|
| 1:32:01| as well as Don Michelle, and the number of people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=5521)|
| 1:32:04| that have worked with us to put this program together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=5524)|
| 1:32:08| We would envision, we will be using local architects,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=5528)|
| 1:32:12| local contractors, local subcontractors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=5532)|
| 1:32:15| to do this building, building a footprint| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=5535)|
| 1:32:18| that would be able to expand, not only with 50 to 60| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=5538)|
| 1:32:24| more operating and skilled and technicians as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=5544)|
| 1:32:27| people as well as driver force for expansion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=5547)|
| 1:32:33| Just as a matter for, as we're making our final decision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=5553)|
| 1:32:37| to build at this location, we're closing on a facility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=5557)|
| 1:32:43| in Lexington, South Carolina, actually tomorrow,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=5563)|
| 1:32:48| I'm sorry, Thursday morning, 15 acres,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=5568)|
| 1:32:51| and we'll be getting the final proposals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=5571)|
| 1:32:56| of what they would offer for potentially expanding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=5576)|
| 1:32:59| at that location as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=5579)|
| 1:33:01| We are at maximum capacity currently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=5581)|
| 1:33:04| at our saddle rack location now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=5584)|
| 1:33:08| so we do need to expand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=5588)|
| 1:33:10| And the economy, the people we work with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=5590)|
| 1:33:15| the ability to hire high quality individuals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=5595)|
| 1:33:18| has been something that is very attractive to us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=5598)|
| 1:33:20| in the Knoxville area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=5600)|
| 1:33:24| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=5604)|
| 1:33:25| I'm glad to answer them for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=5605)|
| 1:33:28| I just, one last thing I wanted you to note, Mr. White.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=5608)|
| 1:33:31| My understanding, this is a small family owned business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=5611)|
| 1:33:35| That's correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=5615)|
| 1:33:38| It is a family owned business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=5618)|
| 1:33:39| It's not small, but family owned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=5619)|
| 1:33:41| Yeah, it's certainly started as just Robert Schilling| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=5621)|
| 1:33:45| who lives in Tennessee, is the CEO,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=5625)|
| 1:33:51| and he owns 75% of it and his brother, Kenny Schilling,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=5631)|
| 1:33:56| owns the other 25%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=5636)|
| 1:33:57| And yes, it is, and three of their sons| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=5637)|
| 1:34:01| are working in the business today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=5641)|
| 1:34:04| One of them leading our Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=5644)|
| 1:34:06| which I think a number of you've met, Dan Schilling,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=5646)|
| 1:34:10| as well as Ben Schilling in the business, Ryan Schilling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=5650)|
| 1:34:13| And so it's a family owned, operated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=5653)|
| 1:34:15| culturally built way as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=5655)|
| 1:34:21| Okay, thank you very much, Mr. White.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=5661)|
| 1:34:23| Any further questions for Mr. White| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=5663)|

| 1:35:15| 12A, an emergency ordinance to amend section 4-76| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=5715)|
| 1:35:19| of the Knoxville City Code to authorize temporary permits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=5719)|
| 1:35:22| issued under declarations of emergency| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=5722)|
| 1:35:25| to certain on-premise beer permit holders| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=5725)|
| 1:35:27| during the COVID-19 pandemic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=5727)|
| 1:35:30| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=5730)|

| 1:35:33| Motion made to approve by Council Member Roberto,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=5733)|
| 1:35:36| seconded by-| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=5736)|
| 1:35:37| Testerman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=5737)|
| 1:35:38| Testerman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=5738)|
| 1:35:40| Mr. Roberto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=5740)|
| 1:35:42| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=5742)|
| 1:35:44| I wanna start off by apologizing to my colleagues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=5744)|
| 1:35:47| that I wasn't able to get this out sooner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=5747)|
| 1:35:50| so we could have co-sponsors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=5750)|
| 1:35:52| This is one where we had to coordinate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=5752)|
| 1:35:53| with a lot of different groups| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=5753)|
| 1:35:55| in order to get this in front of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=5755)|
| 1:35:57| And the idea was we needed to get it in front of council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=5757)|
| 1:36:01| as quickly as we could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=5761)|
| 1:36:03| And it is on emergency,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=5763)|
| 1:36:04| so we'll only have to handle it once.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=5764)|
| 1:36:07| Basically what we have is there's temporary permits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=5767)|
| 1:36:10| right now that allow a restaurant to expand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=5770)|
| 1:36:14| its table service space outside of the regular confines| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=5774)|
| 1:36:18| of their establishment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=5778)|
| 1:36:19| They have to get a permit for that first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=5779)|
| 1:36:22| We've got two of them actually,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=5782)|
| 1:36:24| just one of them came today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=5784)|
| 1:36:26| that is allowing that in Market Square.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=5786)|
| 1:36:29| This would be allowed for restaurants anywhere,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=5789)|
| 1:36:33| but they have to get that temporary permit first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=5793)|
| 1:36:36| What we're allowing in this amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=5796)|
| 1:36:37| is allowing those same spaces to then serve beer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=5797)|
| 1:36:41| And hopefully by doing that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=5801)|
| 1:36:44| we're taking some proactive measures| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=5804)|
| 1:36:46| to help our small businesses, our restaurants,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=5806)|
| 1:36:49| and keep them operating,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=5809)|
| 1:36:52| and then also keeping their employees employed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=5812)|
| 1:36:55| during these difficult times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=5815)|
| 1:36:57| So I hope you can forgive not getting this on the agenda| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=5817)|
| 1:37:01| as quickly as we could have for co-sponsorship,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=5821)|
| 1:37:05| but I hope you can join in support of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=5825)|
| 1:37:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=5828)|
| 1:37:10| Thank you, Council Member Roberto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=5830)|
| 1:37:12| And thank you for working on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=5832)|
| 1:37:15| I think it's a great idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=5835)|
| 1:37:18| Any further comments or questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=5838)|
| 1:37:22| Seeing none, let's move on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=5842)|
| 1:37:25| One quick question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=5845)|
| 1:37:27| Could you help me understand again quickly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=5847)|
| 1:37:29| why it's on emergency?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=5849)|
| 1:37:33| By being on emergency,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=5853)|
| 1:37:34| we won't have to have two readings of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=5854)|
| 1:37:37| So we'll have it done in time for us to vote| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=5857)|
| 1:37:39| on the next beer board meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=5859)|
| 1:37:42| to have the forms ready for people to apply.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=5862)|
| 1:37:45| So the idea is to get this option out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=5865)|
| 1:37:48| to as many restaurants as possible, as quickly as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=5868)|
| 1:37:56| Thank you, Mr. Roberto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=5876)|
| 1:37:57| Mr. Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=5877)|
| 1:37:58| Yeah, I just had a question for clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=5878)|
| 1:38:02| Does this apply only to restaurants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=5882)|
| 1:38:04| that I believe have to serve up to 50%| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=5884)|
| 1:38:07| of their income from food,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=5887)|
| 1:38:09| or does it apply to bars as well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=5889)|
| 1:38:12| where they can do outside seating?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=5892)|
| 1:38:14| Really good question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=5894)|
| 1:38:17| This is only applying to restaurants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=5897)|
| 1:38:20| And it only applies temporarily| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=5900)|
| 1:38:22| during the emergency declaration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=5902)|
| 1:38:24| So after the emergency declaration is no longer in effect,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=5904)|
| 1:38:29| neither would this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=5909)|
| 1:38:30| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=5910)|
| 1:38:37| Okay, any further questions or comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=5917)|
| 1:38:40| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=5920)|
| 1:38:42| This requires six votes to pass to be read on emergency| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=5922)|
| 1:38:45| and to be approved on an emergency basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=5925)|
| 1:38:47| Just FYI.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=5927)|
| 1:38:49| Okay, seeing no further questions or comments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=5929)|

| 1:41:24| Just, I don't know if Mr. Hall or anybody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=6084)|
| 1:41:27| wants to comment on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=6087)|
| 1:41:29| We've extended the moratorium several times,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=6089)|
| 1:41:32| even before this council, I think we instituted it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=6092)|
| 1:41:35| So maybe you want to comment on the continued moratorium| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=6095)|
| 1:41:42| and what our goals are for this pilot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=6102)|
| 1:41:46| in brief, for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=6106)|

| 1:41:53| Yes, there you are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=6113)|
| 1:41:54| Okay, hi, Carter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=6114)|
| 1:41:55| Yeah, I can see you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=6115)|
| 1:41:57| Speak to this, give us an overview| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=6117)|
| 1:41:59| of why this is on the agenda right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=6119)|
| 1:42:01| and what purpose it serves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=6121)|
| 1:42:03| Yeah, absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=6123)|
| 1:42:04| To Council Member Ryder's point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=6124)|
| 1:42:06| back in February of this year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=6126)|
| 1:42:08| council voted to approve to extend the moratorium| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=6128)|
| 1:42:12| on shared mobility vehicles,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=6132)|
| 1:42:14| which for all intents and purposes right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=6134)|
| 1:42:16| are electric scooters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=6136)|
| 1:42:19| That was extended through September 2nd of this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=6139)|
| 1:42:23| And with that coming up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=6143)|
| 1:42:25| we are looking to extend that moratorium| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=6145)|
| 1:42:28| again until June 30th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=6148)|
| 1:42:31| The ultimate goal of this program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=6151)|
| 1:42:32| is not just to keep renewing and extending moratoriums,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=6152)|
| 1:42:36| but to come up with a permanent policy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=6156)|
| 1:42:40| or set of policies to bring before council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=6160)|
| 1:42:42| for you all to possibly approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=6162)|
| 1:42:45| That would really take a holistic view| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=6165)|
| 1:42:47| of shared mobility in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=6167)|
| 1:42:51| But for the sake of stability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=6171)|
| 1:42:54| of shared mobility in Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=6174)|
| 1:42:56| we hope to continue the moratorium for another year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=6176)|
| 1:43:01| Again, with a handful of things that have come up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=6181)|
| 1:43:05| particularly around COVID-19,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=6185)|
| 1:43:08| when non-essential businesses were closed in Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=6188)|
| 1:43:11| that did include the scooter companies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=6191)|
| 1:43:14| the scooters were taken off of the streets| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=6194)|
| 1:43:17| and people were not able to use those,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=6197)|
| 1:43:19| that's impacted a handful of things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=6199)|
| 1:43:21| such as our ability to collect data| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=6201)|
| 1:43:23| to help make informed decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=6203)|
| 1:43:25| As well as back in February,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=6205)|

| 1:51:33| to provide some background on why this rezoning is necessary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=6693)|
| 1:51:38| and I think the next two items are associated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=6698)|
| 1:51:41| So why we need to update the one-year plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=6701)|
| 1:51:45| and the sector plan as a result of this change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=6705)|
| 1:51:48| Go ahead, Mr. Brooks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=6708)|
| 1:51:50| Thank you, Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=6710)|
| 1:51:51| Yes, I'd be happy to answer those questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=6711)|
| 1:51:54| Council Member Smith, Mr. Lanier's application,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=6714)|
| 1:51:57| just for a little background,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=6717)|
| 1:51:58| it was submitted under 1.4G of the city's zoning ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=6718)|
| 1:52:02| for requesting for a prior zoning equivalent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=6722)|
| 1:52:06| So this is an existing development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=6726)|
| 1:52:09| It's a three-unit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=6729)|
| 1:52:11| It's zoned, it's R in one currently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=6731)|
| 1:52:15| And the property owner would like to bring| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=6735)|
| 1:52:16| its current use into conformity with the zoning ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=6736)|
| 1:52:20| during this application time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=6740)|
| 1:52:23| So the property was zoned R2,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=6743)|
| 1:52:25| which allowed the three-unit development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=6745)|
| 1:52:28| and, of course, much greater densities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=6748)|
| 1:52:31| under the previous zoning ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=6751)|
| 1:52:33| So based on planning staff review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=6753)|
| 1:52:35| and as recommended by the Planning Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=6755)|
| 1:52:38| the development is considered appropriate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=6758)|
| 1:52:41| even for this low-density neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=6761)|
| 1:52:44| It's compatible with the surrounding land uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=6764)|
| 1:52:46| It's a house that was converted many years ago to three units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=6766)|
| 1:52:49| The neighborhood consists of a variety of housing types.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=6769)|
| 1:52:53| There's single-family, there's two-family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=6773)|
| 1:52:55| There's also some scattered multifamily developments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=6775)|
| 1:52:58| in this neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=6778)|
| 1:53:00| And it is the opinion of the Planning Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=6780)|
| 1:53:02| that this is a good example of how a small-scale,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=6782)|
| 1:53:06| multifamily can contribute to the diversity of housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=6786)|
| 1:53:10| in these neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=6790)|
| 1:53:11| And this property is located within one-tenth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=6791)|
| 1:53:14| of a mile to a transit route.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=6794)|
| 1:53:17| I believe it's Capus Route 45.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=6797)|
| 1:53:20| And so per the zoning ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=6800)|
| 1:53:22| R3 is intended to accommodate medium-density| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=6802)|
| 1:53:25| or what I actually, I would refer to it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=6805)|
| 1:53:27| as more of a soft or a moderate-density residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=6807)|
| 1:53:30| in these neighborhoods that are typically characterized| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=6810)|
| 1:53:33| by the one- and two-family homes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=6813)|
| 1:53:36| because it does not allow the large-scale multifamily units| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=6816)|
| 1:53:39| found in R4 and R5 and above.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=6819)|
| 1:53:44| So the triplex-style dwellings may be allowed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=6824)|
| 1:53:47| They are a special use approval,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=6827)|
| 1:53:49| and they do include dimensional standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=6829)|
| 1:53:51| that are compatible with other districts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=6831)|
| 1:53:53| such as the R1 and R2 that are found| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=6833)|
| 1:53:56| in low-density districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=6836)|
| 1:53:57| So these include restrictions on heights,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=6837)|
| 1:54:00| building coverage, and setbacks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=6840)|
| 1:54:03| And to answer your second question, Council Member Smith,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=6843)|
| 1:54:06| so the reason for the sector plan in one year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=6846)|
| 1:54:08| plan amendment is that the Laney's classification table| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=6848)|
| 1:54:11| was changed by council back in April of this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=6851)|
| 1:54:17| So I'm moving that RN3 district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=6857)|
| 1:54:20| from low-density residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=6860)|
| 1:54:23| to what is called medium-density residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=6863)|
| 1:54:25| And prior to that change,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=6865)|
| 1:54:28| the RN3 would have been included| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=6868)|
| 1:54:33| in low-density residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=6873)|
| 1:54:34| and wouldn't have required these plan amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=6874)|
| 1:54:36| So the rezoning would have still required| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=6876)|
| 1:54:38| the three publicly-noticed meetings, just as it is now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=6878)|
| 1:54:42| but there would just be one agenda item| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=6882)|
| 1:54:43| at each of these meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=6883)|
| 1:54:45| There would only be a rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=6885)|
| 1:54:47| So with the change of that Laney's classification table,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=6887)|
| 1:54:50| the rezoning now requires these two plan amendments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=6890)|
| 1:54:54| and the property can't be rezoned without these changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=6894)|
| 1:54:59| And I don't know if the administration wants to weigh in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=6899)|
| 1:55:01| regarding Laney's classification table| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=6901)|
| 1:55:03| and maybe some of the broader implications| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=6903)|
| 1:55:05| of those changes that were made earlier this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=6905)|
| 1:55:07| I would defer to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=6907)|
| 1:55:09| Thank you, Ms. Brooks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=6909)|
| 1:55:10| I have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=6910)|
| 1:55:11| I just wanted to clarify that item I, J, and K.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=6911)|
| 1:55:15| I know we're talking about just I now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=6915)|
| 1:55:17| They're all connected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=6917)|
| 1:55:18| They're all related, I, J, and K.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=6918)|
| 1:55:20| And would this development be something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=6920)|
| 1:55:26| that contributes to the so-called missing middle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=6926)|
| 1:55:28| of housing, that's a triplex, you said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=6928)|
| 1:55:33| The missing middle is what a lot of housing advocates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=6933)|
| 1:55:36| call it, is that a fair characterization?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=6936)|
| 1:55:39| I think that's a fair characterization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=6939)|
| 1:55:42| In particular, that RN-3 and RN-4,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=6942)|
| 1:55:45| that was the intent behind introducing those zones| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=6945)|
| 1:55:48| into the new zoning ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=6948)|
| 1:55:49| was to allow those different types of housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=6949)|
| 1:55:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=6951)|
| 1:55:54| Stephanie Welch, did you have anything you wanted to add| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=6954)|
| 1:55:56| to clarify if you're?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=6956)|
| 1:56:00| Yes, thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=6960)|
| 1:56:01| And I'll just make this really quick| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=6961)|
| 1:56:03| because I think, you know, I know council wants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=6963)|
| 1:56:06| to kind of stick to the issue on the table,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=6966)|
| 1:56:08| but I think what Ms. Brooks just outlined flags for us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=6968)|
| 1:56:14| that the land use classification table is something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=6974)|
| 1:56:17| that we will be bringing back to council to revisit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=6977)|
| 1:56:20| I think that planning commission has that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=6980)|
| 1:56:24| on their request list for planning staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=6984)|
| 1:56:28| to bring the land use classification table back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=6988)|
| 1:56:31| to council at a later date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=6991)|
| 1:56:33| That is not the question tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=6993)|
| 1:56:36| We feel like this is a legal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=6996)|
| 1:56:37| and appropriate use of the land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=6997)|
| 1:56:39| It's compatible with the surrounding neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=6999)|
| 1:56:42| And so we are, from an administration standpoint,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=7002)|
| 1:56:46| very supportive of planning's recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=7006)|
| 1:56:49| on this property, and we hope| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=7009)|
| 1:56:51| that council supports that recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=7011)|
| 1:56:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=7016)|

| 2:03:34| and address for the record?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=7414)|
| 2:03:35| My name is Wade Loven with MBI Companies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=7415)|

| 2:03:44| Okay, go ahead and tell us a little bit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=7424)|
| 2:03:46| about this agenda item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=7426)|
| 2:03:49| Okay, the ultimate goal at the end of this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=7429)|
| 2:03:53| is to build a crematory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=7433)|
| 2:03:57| And so that's typically a pretty controversial item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=7437)|
| 2:04:02| And the owners and my clients are asking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=7442)|
| 2:04:06| to put this in the middle of a cemetery.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=7446)|
| 2:04:09| And to me, it makes perfect sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=7449)|
| 2:04:12| And so what we did was we subdivided the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=7452)|
| 2:04:17| to create conformity with the zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=7457)|
| 2:04:24| We asked for rezoning to be able to be in compliance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=7464)|
| 2:04:30| The distances from the property lines| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=7470)|
| 2:04:34| are greater than double the required distances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=7474)|
| 2:04:38| And so we feel like it's a perfect location for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=7478)|
| 2:04:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811b?start=7484)|
