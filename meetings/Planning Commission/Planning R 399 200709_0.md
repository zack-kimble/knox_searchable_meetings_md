| 0:17:50| but believe the Planning staff, the community, and the administration and staff of Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=1070)|
| 0:17:55| and the City of Knoxville will concur with these sentiments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=1075)|
| 0:17:59| Over the past five years, Gerald Green has led Planning Agency with outstanding leadership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=1079)|

| 0:18:54| City and county plans, zoning, and ordinances are continually evolving landscapes and planning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=1134)|
| 0:19:00| will always be a critical part of growth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=1140)|

| 0:19:07| expressed to both city council and county commission goals for creating and maintaining| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=1147)|

| 0:19:20| years is extensive and I could go on and on and on, but in sake of brevity, let me just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=1160)|
| 0:19:26| say we will miss you, Gerald.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=1166)|

| 0:20:15| It seems like I see a bit of me in every one of you, which probably should scare most of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=1215)|
| 0:20:20| you, some of me within each of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=1220)|

| 0:20:49| we came here, and that's something I've truly tried to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=1249)|
| 0:20:53| And I think working with the public certainly takes a certain attitude, but also takes a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=1253)|
| 0:21:00| commitment to the public good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=1260)|

| 0:21:08| to make this place a better community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=1268)|

| 0:24:16| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=1456)|
| 0:24:18| Congratulations, Chair Phillips.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=1458)|
| 0:24:21| Thank you, Beth, and thank you for everybody's support and encouragement there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=1461)|
| 0:24:27| I hope I can live up to our previous chair roles in the Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=1467)|
| 0:24:35| So the Nominating Committee now presents the following nominee for the position of Vice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=1475)|
| 0:24:40| Chair of the Commission for the balance of this calendar year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=1480)|
| 0:24:43| And we present Commissioner Boyers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=1483)|
| 0:24:50| The floor is now open for other nominations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=1490)|
| 0:24:57| I'd like to make a comment that, number one, I find that we all probably would do as good| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=1497)|
| 0:25:07| a job as anybody on these nominations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=1507)|
| 0:25:10| And I certainly think that Tamara would be a very good one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=1510)|
| 0:25:15| I would like to throw out potentially Mr. Smith, Scott Smith, as a potential Vice Chair| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=1515)|
| 0:25:28| only because he is currently on Executive Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=1528)|
| 0:25:33| And we are going to lose Gerald as Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=1533)|
| 0:25:39| We're going to lose Janice as former Chair of Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=1539)|
| 0:25:44| And I think it would be somewhat wise to have somebody up there that has a little bit of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=1544)|
| 0:25:53| history in those other conversations that we all otherwise would not be a part of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=1553)|
| 0:25:59| So I would like to offer that up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=1559)|
| 0:26:06| I also see, Jeff, that you have your hand up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=1566)|
| 0:26:09| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=1569)|
| 0:26:10| Yes, I did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=1570)|
| 0:26:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=1571)|
| 0:26:12| I was going to nominate Scott Smith as Vice Chair for much the same reasons as Chris Hooten| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=1572)|
| 0:26:20| and Mr. Hooten just mentioned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=1580)|
| 0:26:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=1583)|
| 0:26:24| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=1584)|
| 0:26:25| I don't see any additional hands up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=1585)|
| 0:26:36| Okay, so hearing no additional nominees other than Boyers and Smith, I hear a motion to nomination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=1596)|
| 0:26:44| I'm sorry, but can we ask each of them to give a brief statement so that those of us who are new can have a little bit more background?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=1604)|
| 0:26:55| Sure, that's a good idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=1615)|
| 0:26:58| Commissioner Boyers, would you like to go first?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=1618)|
| 0:27:02| I'm Tamara Boyer and I am an attorney in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=1622)|
| 0:27:07| I've been mostly in the mortgage finance, wealth management, and foundational work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=1627)|
| 0:27:12| So my experience on commission would come from my time in and then also my ability to serve would be aided by my experience as an attorney to understand code and regulations and such.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=1632)|
| 0:27:28| Having said that, I would also have to say that I have great admiration for Scott Smith and for his experience in many of the areas of our community and in industries that impact decisions that we make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=1648)|
| 0:27:43| So I would have to likewise say that I think Scott would be compelling for the role and likewise his experience as Chris noted on executives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=1663)|
| 0:27:57| So whichever way that the vote goes, I would be entirely supportive of Commissioner Smith for that role.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=1677)|
| 0:28:06| Thank you. Commissioner Smith, would you like to say a few things?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=1686)|
| 0:28:10| Yeah, I just I've been in real estate business and involved in around the Planning Commission since I was probably 25 years old.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=1690)|
| 0:28:22| I remember Chris Uden worked behind the counter back then. But anyhow, that's what I've spent my life doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=1702)|
| 0:28:28| And I'm in my second term on the Planning Commission, really have learned a lot, really have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=1708)|
| 0:28:36| There's a lot of things that my that that I've learned through doing this that have kind of given me a new perspective on land use and planning that was really eye opening for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=1716)|
| 0:28:47| But anyway, I like I really appreciate what Tamara says and I feel the same way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=1727)|
| 0:28:52| I think she would do a great job as well. And if she gets it, I'm happy for her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=1732)|
| 0:28:58| This this commission, I feel like we we're a good family and we try to make good decisions and I'd love the opportunity to serve in this role.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=1738)|
| 0:29:07| I appreciate being nominated. But no matter what happens, we'll we'll be buddies and we'll move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=1747)|
| 0:29:16| Anyway, that's all I got.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=1756)|
| 0:29:20| All right, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=1760)|

| 0:34:01| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=2041)|
| 0:34:02| Is there opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=2042)|
| 0:34:05| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=2045)|
| 0:34:07| Commissioner Phillips, I'm sorry to interrupt,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=2047)|
| 0:34:09| but at what point are we going to discuss the email| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=2049)|
| 0:34:13| from Mr. Murphy regarding submittals and information?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=2053)|
| 0:34:20| It pertains to the entire set of hearings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=2060)|
| 0:34:23| and I didn't know when it would be proper to address that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=2063)|
| 0:34:27| That opportunity will be once the applicant decides| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=2067)|
| 0:34:30| if he would like to go first or the opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=2070)|
| 0:34:33| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=2073)|
| 0:34:34| Right now it's in the applicant's position| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=2074)|
| 0:34:36| if he wants to go first| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=2076)|
| 0:34:37| or if he wants the opposition to go first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=2077)|
| 0:34:41| So it's not something we want to discuss just in general.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=2081)|
| 0:34:44| It will apply to-| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=2084)|
| 0:34:44| Not right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=2084)|
| 0:34:45| No, we need to hear from the applicant first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=2085)|
| 0:34:54| Mr. Chair, if I may speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=2094)|
| 0:34:57| This is someone in response| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=2097)|
| 0:34:59| to Commissioner Korbelik's question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=2099)|
| 0:35:02| The comments are specific to each case before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=2102)|
| 0:35:06| If there's a general discussion that is desired,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=2106)|
| 0:35:10| that should be identified and placed on an agenda| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=2110)|
| 0:35:13| with appropriate notice just to have general discussions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=2113)|
| 0:35:17| with that appropriate notice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=2117)|
| 0:35:18| so all those impacted could be aware of it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=2118)|
| 0:35:20| and participate as would not be appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=2120)|
| 0:35:23| Again, comments and discussions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=2123)|
| 0:35:25| should be specific to each item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=2125)|
| 0:35:28| Again, if there's a general discussion that's desired,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=2128)|
| 0:35:31| that should be identified and then placed on an agenda| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=2131)|
| 0:35:34| for a later meeting when all involved can participate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=2134)|
| 0:35:40| Mr. Williams, would you like to go first?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=2140)|
| 0:35:42| Would you like the opposition to go first?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=2142)|
| 0:35:45| I'm fine reserving my time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=2145)|
| 0:35:47| for enlisted opposition, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=2147)|
| 0:35:50| Mr. Murphy, you have five minutes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=2150)|
| 0:35:53| and if there's anyone else in opposing the request,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=2153)|
| 0:35:56| please divide the time proportionately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=2156)|
| 0:35:59| Go ahead, Mr. Murphy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=2159)|
| 0:36:01| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=2161)|
| 0:36:01| Is there anybody else that's speaking?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=2161)|
| 0:36:06| Take that as a no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=2166)|
| 0:36:07| All right, thank you very much, Chairman Phillips.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=2167)|
| 0:36:10| On this request, the request for the change in zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=2170)|
| 0:36:14| was linked to changing conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=2174)|
| 0:36:19| Part of what we want to look at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=2179)|
| 0:36:20| is what conditions are changing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=2180)|
| 0:36:23| There's been a generic statement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=2183)|
| 0:36:25| about the growth of Johnson University,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=2185)|
| 0:36:27| but I don't think we've seen any evidence yet presented| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=2187)|
| 0:36:30| that talks about enrollment growth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=2190)|
| 0:36:32| driving the demand for offsite housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=2192)|
| 0:36:35| for students or faculty or staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=2195)|
| 0:36:37| That's some really critical information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=2197)|
| 0:36:40| The reason it's important is that this area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=2200)|
| 0:36:43| is all predominantly agricultural.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=2203)|
| 0:36:46| The desire for a change of a sector plan amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=2206)|
| 0:36:53| and the zoning here should have some justification| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=2213)|
| 0:36:57| and we haven't seen that justification yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=2217)|
| 0:36:59| Is there some new numbers that are coming out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=2219)|
| 0:37:02| that we need to get from enrollment or something like that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=2222)|
| 0:37:08| And why is it important?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=2228)|
| 0:37:09| It's because not only if a vague justification| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=2229)|
| 0:37:13| is used to rezone this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=2233)|
| 0:37:15| then you've lowered the standard of what's required| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=2235)|
| 0:37:18| for rezoning any of the other parcels out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=2238)|
| 0:37:20| and you get some haphazard development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=2240)|
| 0:37:22| It'd be really great if the South County Sector Plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=2242)|
| 0:37:24| actually identified this as an area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=2244)|
| 0:37:27| but it doesn't identify anything special.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=2247)|
| 0:37:31| I believe I asked you to look at about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=2251)|
| 0:37:35| I think it's page 28 of the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=2255)|
| 0:37:37| If you look at the numbers on the pages,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=2257)|
| 0:37:39| it's pages 31 in the PDF.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=2259)|
| 0:37:41| It only shows two special use districts out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=2261)|
| 0:37:45| and it doesn't show anything relating to Johnson University.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=2265)|
| 0:37:47| So there's nothing really mentioned in the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=2267)|
| 0:37:50| So that's, I'd really think of it probably,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=2270)|
| 0:37:53| there probably is a need to have something out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=2273)|
| 0:37:56| but the question is, what's the right way to plan that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=2276)|
| 0:37:58| And I think just looking at one parcel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=2278)|
| 0:38:01| is not the right way to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=2281)|
| 0:38:04| The other thing, I just did send a follow-up email| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=2284)|
| 0:38:07| on Tuesday following up on the question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=2287)|
| 0:38:09| about the growth policy plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=2289)|
| 0:38:11| Section 3.5 details some conditions that must be met| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=2291)|
| 0:38:16| in order to approve planned residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=2296)|
| 0:38:19| up to three dwelling units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=2299)|
| 0:38:22| And in particular, you need to have sanitary sewer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=2302)|
| 0:38:25| You also need to have connecting collector| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=2305)|
| 0:38:29| and arterial roads from the development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=2309)|
| 0:38:30| to the urban growth boundary of the planned growth area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=2310)|
| 0:38:33| And then traffic impact analysis demonstrating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=2313)|
| 0:38:36| so that the effect will not unreasonably impair traffic flow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=2316)|
| 0:38:40| on the arterial roads through the adjacent planned growth area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=2320)|
| 0:38:43| So those all need to be in effect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=2323)|
| 0:38:45| to get three dwelling units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=2325)|
| 0:38:47| Otherwise, then section 3.2 is the growth plan controls,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=2327)|
| 0:38:50| which limits it to two dwelling units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=2330)|
| 0:38:53| So that is what I wanted to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=2333)|
| 0:38:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=2337)|
| 0:38:58| Mr. Murphy, if you don't mind,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=2338)|
| 0:38:59| give me your address, please, for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=2339)|
| 0:39:01| 4508 Murphy Road, 37918.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=2341)|
| 0:39:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=2345)|
| 0:39:07| Mr. Williams, please your address,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=2347)|
| 0:39:08| please your name and address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=2348)|
| 0:39:10| You have five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=2350)|
| 0:39:11| Okay, Scott Williams, 4530 Annalee Way, Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=2351)|
| 0:39:18| First off, I wanna state that I'm the engineer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=2358)|
| 0:39:22| help and land surveyor helping the owner of this property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=2362)|
| 0:39:25| to try to do a little subdivision here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=2365)|
| 0:39:27| And as we looked at the best use for the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=2367)|
| 0:39:30| and attempts to try to make the maximum usage out of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=2370)|
| 0:39:34| of course, we wanna try to reasonably maximize density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=2374)|
| 0:39:38| It is a smaller piece of 3.29 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=2378)|
| 0:39:43| And it's limited somewhat by the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=2383)|
| 0:39:46| it's limited by the actual,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=2386)|
| 0:39:49| the shape of the property to no more than,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=2389)|
| 0:39:54| than the nine units we're asking for, 10 units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=2394)|
| 0:39:57| The truth of the matter is it would all front on the road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=2397)|
| 0:40:04| it's a pretty simple sub.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=2404)|
| 0:40:06| The very difficult thing for developers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=2406)|
| 0:40:08| I find in my daily business is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=2408)|
| 0:40:10| they run across these tracks like this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=2410)|
| 0:40:12| or nice little easy subdivisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=2412)|
| 0:40:15| But the problem with them is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=2415)|
| 0:40:17| that you just can't generate enough income out of them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=2417)|
| 0:40:22| to even put the infrastructure in hardly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=2422)|
| 0:40:25| unless you get enough units out of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=2425)|
| 0:40:26| Three is about the bare minimum, as you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=2426)|
| 0:40:29| low density is defined zero to five units per acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=2429)|
| 0:40:32| in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=2432)|
| 0:40:33| I know it's limited on this property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=2433)|
| 0:40:35| due to the actual rural residential designation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=2435)|
| 0:40:41| but even that allows two,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=2441)|
| 0:40:42| which you could get up to six units per acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=2442)|
| 0:40:46| on the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=2446)|
| 0:40:47| So in effect, we're just asking for the ability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=2447)|
| 0:40:49| to build three more homes there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=2449)|
| 0:40:51| As for the growth of the area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=2451)|
| 0:40:56| the university out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=2456)|
| 0:41:00| and Knox Chapman Utility District,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=2460)|
| 0:41:03| are currently involved in putting a force main in system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=2463)|
| 0:41:08| that runs out essentially to this intersection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=2468)|
| 0:41:11| that we're talking about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=2471)|
| 0:41:12| at Bays Mountain and Kimberlin Heights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=2472)|
| 0:41:14| This force main now allows us to have sewer at the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=2474)|
| 0:41:19| which is a big hurdle for most properties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=2479)|
| 0:41:23| in increasing the density on them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=2483)|
| 0:41:25| So in this instance, we do have sewer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=2485)|
| 0:41:28| and of course we already had water there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=2488)|
| 0:41:31| We've already had discussions with Knox Chapman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=2491)|
| 0:41:34| They did provide a letter for availability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=2494)|
| 0:41:38| for the property for water and sewer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=2498)|
| 0:41:40| So we do have that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=2500)|
| 0:41:41| So that is a big hurdle in trying to make sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=2501)|
| 0:41:45| that you can get a little bit of density on a property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=2505)|
| 0:41:49| And like I said, I don't know that we're out here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=2509)|
| 0:41:52| wanting to set the trend or anything necessarily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=2512)|
| 0:41:55| It just happened for this specific piece.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=2515)|
| 0:41:57| It makes a big difference| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=2517)|
| 0:41:58| on whether the track can actually support enough homes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=2518)|
| 0:42:03| to make the project feasible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=2523)|
| 0:42:05| So I do think we have growth in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=2525)|
| 0:42:07| I do think it's something as the previous speaker said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=2527)|
| 0:42:11| that maybe something the county can look at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=2531)|
| 0:42:14| with the growth policy plan going forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=2534)|
| 0:42:17| but also don't think that it has necessarily| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=2537)|
| 0:42:19| set a precedent in the area just because it gets passed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=2539)|
| 0:42:24| I see examples of this all around the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=2544)|
| 0:42:27| actually all around the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=2547)|
| 0:42:28| And that's why we come before MPC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=2548)|
| 0:42:32| so they can make decisions on each case| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=2552)|
| 0:42:35| and decide whether it's logical for that specific parcel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=2555)|
| 0:42:37| So with that, I'd like to reserve any of my remaining time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=2557)|
| 0:42:43| Thank you, Mr. Williams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=2563)|
| 0:42:45| Staff on this is Ms. Albertson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=2565)|
| 0:42:49| She discussed this at the workshop on Tuesday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=2569)|
| 0:42:53| So I will not call on her unless there's a commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=2573)|
| 0:42:57| that has questions for her regarding this application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=2577)|
| 0:43:04| This is Dick Graf.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=2584)|
| 0:43:07| I've lost the screen, but I can still hear you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=2587)|
| 0:43:11| Can you hear me okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=2591)|
| 0:43:13| I can hear you and I can see you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=2593)|
| 0:43:15| Oh, you can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=2595)|
| 0:43:16| Well, I can't see you, but okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=2596)|
| 0:43:20| That might be a good thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=2600)|
| 0:43:23| I took a ride out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=2603)|
| 0:43:24| and I'm somewhat familiar with the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=2604)|
| 0:43:27| I live south and on the sector plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=2607)|
| 0:43:32| I can't see any reason why we would change the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=2612)|
| 0:43:40| I can't see where anything has been done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=2620)|
| 0:43:43| in the last 20 or 25 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=2623)|
| 0:43:46| That is just completely rural.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=2626)|
| 0:43:49| It's the same as it was 20 years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=2629)|
| 0:43:53| And if development or if the need arises,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=2633)|
| 0:44:00| it's not evident.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=2640)|
| 0:44:02| And we've talked about the density and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=2642)|
| 0:44:09| I don't think we need to be on the rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=2649)|
| 0:44:14| I think we should be talking about the sector plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=2654)|
| 0:44:19| and the sector plan has definite rules| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=2659)|
| 0:44:24| as to what you look for and I don't see it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=2664)|
| 0:44:28| And if you'd taken a ride out there and looked at it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=2668)|
| 0:44:31| if you'd seen growth, you'd seen more than I have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=2671)|
| 0:44:38| I can't support the sector, changing the sector plan even.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=2678)|
| 0:44:43| So I'll leave it there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=2683)|
| 0:44:44| Listen to other comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=2684)|
| 0:44:47| Thank you, Commissioner Graf.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=2687)|
| 0:44:49| Commissioner Eason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=2689)|
| 0:44:52| I think my comments are similar to Commissioner Graf.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=2692)|
| 0:44:56| I think that what we should do is wait| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=2696)|
| 0:44:57| and until it's time to update the sector plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=2697)|
| 0:45:00| and look at the sector plan as a whole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=2700)|
| 0:45:03| And then if at that time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=2703)|
| 0:45:05| SOAR is in place and other improvements have happened| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=2705)|
| 0:45:07| and the community feels like that needs to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=2707)|
| 0:45:11| a rural crossroads district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=2711)|
| 0:45:12| then let's look at it from the sector plan perspective| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=2712)|
| 0:45:16| rather than starting with the rezoning at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=2716)|
| 0:45:20| Thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=2720)|
| 0:45:22| Commissioner Roth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=2722)|
| 0:45:24| Mr. Williams, did I hear you say you do have SOAR out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=2724)|
| 0:45:28| or access to SOAR there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=2728)|
| 0:45:29| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=2729)|
| 0:45:31| Knox Chapman is currently running a force main line out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=2731)|
| 0:45:34| to capture this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=2734)|
| 0:45:38| And is that going now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=2738)|
| 0:45:41| So it would be in place for this development?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=2741)|
| 0:45:44| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=2744)|
| 0:45:46| I agree 100% you can't do this development without SOAR.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=2746)|
| 0:45:49| And that's the difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=2749)|
| 0:45:51| One of the speakers spoke of nothing's changed out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=2751)|
| 0:45:56| Well, there's always the poor sap that's first in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=2756)|
| 0:45:59| which happens to be my owner here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=2759)|
| 0:46:02| And the thing that did change is SOAR.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=2762)|
| 0:46:04| So I would suspect that you may start entertaining| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=2764)|
| 0:46:08| more and more inquiries about land out here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=2768)|
| 0:46:12| to possibly rezone just because of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=2772)|
| 0:46:16| So, like I said, I'm not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=2776)|
| 0:46:17| we've asked for the sector plan amendment too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=2777)|
| 0:46:20| and maybe it needs to be looked at in the growth plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=2780)|
| 0:46:23| for that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=2783)|
| 0:46:24| But I think the existence of SOAR most definitely| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=2784)|
| 0:46:28| is going to change what can and can't be done out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=2788)|
| 0:46:32| So that's the only reason that we brought it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=2792)|
| 0:46:35| before the commission at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=2795)|
| 0:46:38| Yeah, yeah, I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=2798)|
| 0:46:39| And unfortunately, right now, out there in that area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=2799)|
| 0:46:44| our method of dealing with the sector plan is this way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=2804)|
| 0:46:49| because it hasn't been revisited in a long time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=2809)|
| 0:46:51| I don't believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=2811)|
| 0:46:53| Liz, when was the last time the sector plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=2813)|
| 0:46:55| was looked at out there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=2815)|
| 0:46:57| Yes, it was updated in 2012.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=2817)|
| 0:47:01| 2012, so it's eight years old.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=2821)|
| 0:47:04| I'm inclined to agree with staff on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=2824)|
| 0:47:07| I will make one caveat though,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=2827)|
| 0:47:09| that the East County Community Plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=2829)|
| 0:47:14| that was completed in, I believe, 2016,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=2834)|
| 0:47:20| that included a portion of the South County sector| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=2840)|
| 0:47:24| around the French Broad River,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=2844)|
| 0:47:26| and this was within that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=2846)|
| 0:47:29| So there was some long range planning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=2849)|
| 0:47:32| that was done for this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=2852)|
| 0:47:35| That plan was adopted into both the East County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=2855)|
| 0:47:39| or sorry, East, yeah, East County Sector Plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=2859)|
| 0:47:42| as well as the South County Sector Plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=2862)|
| 0:47:45| So there has been some long range planning work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=2865)|
| 0:47:49| that has been done in the general area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=2869)|
| 0:47:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=2873)|
| 0:47:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=2874)|
| 0:47:56| I can't-| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=2876)|
| 0:47:56| Commissioner Scott, wait a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=2876)|
| 0:47:57| Sandra, just one second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=2877)|
| 0:48:00| You need to raise your hand,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=2880)|
| 0:48:01| and I need to recognize Commissioner Scott Smith, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=2881)|
| 0:48:08| Commissioner Smith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=2888)|
| 0:48:12| Sorry, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=2892)|
| 0:48:13| I was gonna ask whoever's running the screen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=2893)|
| 0:48:16| if you could zoom in on the 2020 aerial photograph| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=2896)|
| 0:48:20| in the intersection of Kimberlin Heights and Bays Mountain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=2900)|
| 0:48:26| It appears all along that road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=2906)|
| 0:48:28| and I don't know if this is the sewer line,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=2908)|
| 0:48:30| but if you'll zoom in down there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=2910)|
| 0:48:32| it appears that utilities have been run| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=2912)|
| 0:48:34| on the upper north side of Kimberlin Heights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=2914)|
| 0:48:37| If you go to the 2020 picture that I'm looking at on KGIS,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=2917)|
| 0:48:41| and that, I don't know if that's the sewer line,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=2921)|
| 0:48:45| but it runs the entire length of Kimberlin Heights Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=2925)|
| 0:48:52| So if that is the engineer, the applicant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=2932)|
| 0:48:55| can you tell us, is that the sewer line?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=2935)|
| 0:49:01| That's a good question, Scott.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=2941)|
| 0:49:03| I believe it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=2943)|
| 0:49:04| That's exactly where Knox Chapman showed it running| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=2944)|
| 0:49:06| on the plan that I saw.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=2946)|
| 0:49:10| I'll be honest, I've not been out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=2950)|
| 0:49:12| and driven up through that section lately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=2952)|
| 0:49:14| I believe the picture's newer than my visit out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=2954)|
| 0:49:18| On my 2020 on KGIS, it shows that running the entire length| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=2958)|
| 0:49:23| of Kimberlin Heights Road, and if that is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=2963)|
| 0:49:27| I mean, it's some utilities, and if that's the case,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=2967)|
| 0:49:29| it does justify a sector plan change,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=2969)|
| 0:49:32| because it plainly says introduction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=2972)|
| 0:49:35| of significant new roads or utilities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=2975)|
| 0:49:37| that were not anticipated in the plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=2977)|
| 0:49:40| and make development more feasible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=2980)|
| 0:49:45| So if, you know, it appears to be the case, but.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=2985)|
| 0:49:50| I can tell you that's where the sewer line is proposed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=2990)|
| 0:49:53| and is probably in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=2993)|
| 0:49:54| It was last discussion I had with the client.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=2994)|
| 0:49:57| They told me, because I asked him| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=2997)|
| 0:49:59| to get an availability letter from Knox Chapman,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=2999)|
| 0:50:02| that I wouldn't even bring this before you guys| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=3002)|
| 0:50:04| without that, because I knew it was an absolute no-go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=3004)|
| 0:50:07| So I would imagine that's likely it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=3007)|
| 0:50:11| It was supposed to run along| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=3011)|
| 0:50:12| the north side of Kimberlin Heights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=3012)|
| 0:50:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=3016)|
| 0:50:17| Commissioner Boston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=3017)|
| 0:50:19| Yes, thank you, Commissioner Phillips.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=3019)|
| 0:50:23| My question is, how do we confirm that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=3023)|
| 0:50:26| that that's utilities, number one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=3026)|
| 0:50:29| Number two, as in the past,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=3029)|
| 0:50:33| we know that we have to have strong justification| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=3033)|
| 0:50:36| to amend a sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=3036)|
| 0:50:39| And I don't see that we have that strong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=3039)|
| 0:50:44| I know that the staff is just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=3044)|
| 0:50:46| because of changing conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=3046)|
| 0:50:49| I agree with Commissioner Graf.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=3049)|
| 0:50:51| I went out there, I didn't see a lot of change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=3051)|
| 0:50:54| going on out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=3054)|
| 0:50:55| So I, obviously, if we can confirm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=3055)|
| 0:50:58| that that is the utility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=3058)|
| 0:51:01| that they are gonna be put,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=3061)|

| 0:53:04| I'd like to point out just one thing here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=3184)|
| 0:53:08| I don't have a hand icon,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=3188)|
| 0:53:11| so I've been unable to raise my hand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=3191)|
| 0:53:14| If Commissioner Phillips for the rest of the hearing items,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=3194)|
| 0:53:20| if you'll notice when my hand is up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=3200)|
| 0:53:22| that I don't, for some reason,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=3202)|
| 0:53:24| this particular Zoom format doesn't allow me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=3204)|
| 0:53:27| to raise my hand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=3207)|
| 0:53:29| What I had wanted to say just real briefly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=3209)|
| 0:53:32| and I know we're in the middle of a vote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=3212)|
| 0:53:33| but I haven't had a chance to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=3213)|
| 0:53:37| One is the applicant's justification was Boston University,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=3217)|
| 0:53:42| and I checked their enrollments and their faculty,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=3222)|
| 0:53:45| and it hasn't been a tremendous increase over the years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=3225)|
| 0:53:50| And then the second is that planning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=3230)|
| 0:53:53| and looking at the interrelationship of uses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=3233)|
| 0:53:57| goes far beyond whether or not a sewer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=3237)|
| 0:53:59| is available in the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=3239)|
| 0:54:02| So I am voting against this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=3242)|
| 0:54:04| because I'm in favor of approaching this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=3244)|
| 0:54:06| through the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=3246)|

| 0:58:24| please state your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=3504)|
| 0:58:27| My name is Joe Petry,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=3507)|
| 0:58:29| president of Conversion Properties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=3509)|
| 0:58:32| 520 West Summit Hill Drive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=3512)|
| 0:58:34| suite 903, Knoxville, Tennessee 37902.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=3514)|
| 0:58:38| And we're just simply rezoning a tract| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=3518)|
| 0:58:41| that is the part of the last remaining tract| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=3521)|
| 0:58:46| in Spring Farm, which has been industrial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=3526)|
| 0:58:50| We have a medical office use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=3530)|
| 0:58:53| that we'd like to develop for there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=3533)|
| 0:58:54| And we've chosen the West side of the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=3534)|
| 0:58:57| for two reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=3537)|
| 0:58:57| One, it's adjacent to other medical office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=3537)|
| 0:59:00| in that same vicinity and actually touches medical office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=3540)|
| 0:59:07| And secondly, it's just a flatter piece of property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=3547)|
| 0:59:09| easier to develop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=3549)|
| 0:59:12| We will create a new road in conjunction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=3552)|
| 0:59:15| with the current owners of Spring Farm LLC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=3555)|
| 0:59:19| across the front of our property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=3559)|
| 0:59:22| and the remaining property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=3562)|
| 0:59:25| to connect the two entrances and exits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=3565)|
| 0:59:29| the primary exit and entrance at Spring Farm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=3569)|
| 0:59:33| And then I believe it's called Member Lane,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=3573)|
| 0:59:37| which only goes to the credit union| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=3577)|
| 0:59:40| and the parcel in question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=3580)|
| 0:59:43| And like I said, it's adjacent to the precedence there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=3583)|
| 0:59:48| Obviously it's adjacent to other medical office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=3588)|
| 0:59:50| very large medical office park| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=3590)|
| 0:59:52| in not exclusively medical office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=3592)|
| 0:59:56| but a lot of medical office in Dow Springs, of course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=3596)|
| 1:00:03| Thank you, Mr. Petry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=3603)|

| 1:00:12| we'll not ask her for any additional information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=3612)|

| 1:05:24| All right, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=3924)|
| 1:05:26| I sent in some petitions that I have signed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=3926)|
| 1:05:31| Obviously, I run a business, so I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=3931)|
| 1:05:34| trying to dedicate as much time to this as I can,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=3934)|
| 1:05:37| and still be able to take care of customers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=3937)|
| 1:05:40| I also sent in a letter of basically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=3940)|
| 1:05:43| what I was going to say, so that way I would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=3943)|
| 1:05:45| have something to read off of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=3945)|

| 1:05:52| The reason why I started this about three years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=3952)|
| 1:05:56| it started out very small, and I still| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=3956)|
| 1:06:00| work full time at Kenworth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=3960)|

| 1:06:04| service, great parts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=3964)|

| 1:06:09| to help a lot of people, not just the customers I have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=3969)|
| 1:06:13| but community, friends, family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=3973)|
| 1:06:18| I try and sponsor as much as I can,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=3978)|
| 1:06:21| whether it's sports teams, race teams, just a variety of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=3981)|
| 1:06:26| I think the biggest thing, the reason| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=3986)|
| 1:06:29| why I want this to go through is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=3989)|
| 1:06:32| as I've looked in the last few months for other properties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=3992)|
| 1:06:36| nearby, I have not found any that is still in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=3996)|

| 1:06:51| The other one lives 45 minutes away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=4011)|
| 1:06:55| We're open 9 to 6, Monday through Friday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=4015)|
| 1:06:59| I try and keep as little impact as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=4019)|
| 1:07:05| I work on a lot of the community's vehicles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=4025)|
| 1:07:10| I work on, whether it's tow trucks, garbage companies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=4030)|
| 1:07:14| several car lots nearby.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=4034)|

| 1:07:21| within a couple mile area of me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=4041)|

| 1:07:33| to the Corrington Church area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=4053)|
| 1:07:39| I think Corrington and Gibbs, the whole community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=4059)|
| 1:07:42| is growing a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=4062)|
| 1:07:43| They just approved another subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=4063)|
| 1:07:46| I think with growth, you're going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=4066)|
| 1:07:49| to need more banks, grocery stores, service centers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=4069)|
| 1:07:52| I mean, all of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=4072)|
| 1:07:55| If you look as far as strictly diesel specialists| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=4075)|
| 1:07:59| in this area, the closest one is Smoky Mountain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=4079)|
| 1:08:03| on Rutledge Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=4083)|

| 1:08:10| none of which work on diesels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=4090)|

| 1:08:15| I work on a lot of farming equipment here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=4095)|
| 1:08:19| A decent amount.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=4099)|
| 1:08:20| And if it's not necessarily categorized| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=4100)|
| 1:08:22| as farming equipment, I work on a lot of commercial trucks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=4102)|
| 1:08:24| People that use these trucks every day for a living.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=4104)|
| 1:08:28| I feel like if I wasn't able to be here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=4108)|
| 1:08:31| not only is there free families not getting paychecks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=4111)|
| 1:08:35| there's a lot of people that's going to have to go elsewhere| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=4115)|
| 1:08:37| to get their trucks worked on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=4117)|
| 1:08:39| I have no intentions of putting a commercial sign up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=4119)|
| 1:08:43| I don't need a commercial sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=4123)|
| 1:08:46| I don't really want to change a whole lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=4126)|
| 1:08:49| as far as the looks or as far as signs or anything like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=4129)|
| 1:08:53| If you zoom in on like a geographical map,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=4133)|
| 1:08:59| you can see there's a gate about a hundred yards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=4139)|
| 1:09:02| past Idle going towards Grades on my property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=4142)|

| 1:09:10| I've spoke to the people of the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=4150)|
| 1:09:13| I think, and I'm up for changing some stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=4153)|
| 1:09:17| We can run the entrance to the property down to Emory| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=4157)|
| 1:09:23| with working with the state to do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=4163)|
| 1:09:25| Turning on the Idle is very hard as it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=4165)|
| 1:09:30| Mr. Walker, I hate to interrupt,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=4170)|
| 1:09:32| but you have 54 seconds left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=4172)|

| 1:09:42| understand that I'm not a very small company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=4182)|

| 1:09:57| I do a lot of business locally, weekly, monthly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=4197)|
| 1:10:02| And I just think the community has a need for it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=4202)|
| 1:10:07| and I can create a huge impact if given the opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=4207)|
| 1:10:11| If I do have to move,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=4211)|
| 1:10:13| I have no way of having that impact on the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=4213)|
| 1:10:22| That's all I have to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=4222)|
| 1:10:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=4223)|

| 1:11:01| Kevin Murphy, 4508 Murphy Road, 37918.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=4261)|
| 1:11:05| Speaking on behalf as the chair| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=4265)|
| 1:11:06| of the Knox County Planning Alliance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=4266)|
| 1:11:09| We've looked at this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=4269)|
| 1:11:11| This was a, you know, this is the first thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=4271)|
| 1:11:14| I looked at in the sector plan designation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=4274)|
| 1:11:16| This sector plan was updated in 2015| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=4276)|
| 1:11:19| and there is, and I was at those meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=4279)|
| 1:11:22| there was very explicit discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=4282)|
| 1:11:24| about how we wanted this area to look| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=4284)|
| 1:11:27| and we want to set up this all as agricultural| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=4287)|
| 1:11:32| and for that to remain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=4292)|
| 1:11:34| The sector plan, Northeast County sector plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=4294)|
| 1:11:37| very specifically calls out the desire of this area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=4297)|
| 1:11:42| to be agriculture and the rural nature| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=4302)|
| 1:11:45| and the need to preserve it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=4305)|
| 1:11:47| It also, we've set out a mixed use district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=4307)|
| 1:11:50| in the, both in the Gibbs area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=4310)|
| 1:11:52| and then we've got a Coryton Village area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=4312)|
| 1:11:55| that's set aside for some rural commercial as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=4315)|
| 1:11:58| So we've, there's been intention on the sector plan here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=4318)|
| 1:12:02| and this was done in the last five years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=4322)|
| 1:12:03| So there hasn't been a need to change that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=4323)|
| 1:12:07| You know, this, you know, even if the sector plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=4327)|
| 1:12:11| was changed to something that was allowed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=4331)|
| 1:12:13| by the land use classification,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=4333)|
| 1:12:14| the CA zoning designation is way too intense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=4334)|
| 1:12:17| It's a legacy classification| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=4337)|
| 1:12:19| that we should not use anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=4339)|
| 1:12:21| The ones that are appropriate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=4341)|
| 1:12:22| according to land use classification| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=4342)|
| 1:12:23| would be a neighborhood commercial or rural commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=4343)|
| 1:12:27| And, you know, neighborhood commercial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=4347)|
| 1:12:31| allows vehicle repair as a use on review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=4351)|
| 1:12:34| but this property wouldn't even be able| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=4354)|
| 1:12:35| to meet those conditions of the use on review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=4355)|
| 1:12:37| that are set out in the zoning ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=4357)|
| 1:12:40| This just doesn't-| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=4360)|
| 1:12:41| There's three other individuals who'd like to speak| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=4361)|
| 1:12:43| and you can wrap it up real quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=4363)|
| 1:12:46| All right, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=4366)|
| 1:12:47| I've sent you some pictures for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=4367)|
| 1:12:50| I expect that all of you have now looked at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=4370)|
| 1:12:53| and I'll give you an example of, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=4373)|
| 1:12:55| some issues that have been had with onsite parking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=4375)|
| 1:12:58| with fences, and importantly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=4378)|
| 1:13:01| a video that kind of gives you an example| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=4381)|
| 1:13:03| of some noise impact as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=4383)|
| 1:13:05| noise and air pollution impact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=4385)|

| 1:13:24| where he built to run his diesel shop,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=4404)|
| 1:13:26| which started out to be small| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=4406)|
| 1:13:28| and now it's growing to be a huge, huge inconvenience| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=4408)|
| 1:13:33| for the traffic that comes in, the wreckers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=4413)|
| 1:13:37| and other issues which are around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=4417)|

| 1:13:45| because it would just be a big mess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=4425)|

| 1:14:30| They build like a stockade back there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=4470)|
| 1:14:33| It's like eight to 10 feet high fence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=4473)|
| 1:14:36| right in front of my mother's property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=4476)|
| 1:14:38| which I'm in the process of trying to sell,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=4478)|
| 1:14:41| and the real estate agent said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=4481)|
| 1:14:42| this is really gonna hurt property values of all of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=4482)|
| 1:14:46| It's right in front of my mother's house,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=4486)|
| 1:14:48| and I've sent in pictures to show that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=4488)|
| 1:14:51| because we all have concerns with all the traffic coming and going,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=4491)|
| 1:14:54| and we're good friends of Travis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=4494)|

| 1:14:59| but I think he just got in over his head building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=4499)|
| 1:15:02| you know, what he started out with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=4502)|
| 1:15:04| and we just think it's way too big of an operation where it's located.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=4504)|

| 1:27:28| to approve the rezoning. If the rezoning, if this motion fails, the vote on this motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=5248)|
| 1:27:35| is to, it's not an affirmative vote, there would be another, need to be another motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=5255)|
| 1:27:40| to approve the rezoning. In that case, it would go automatically to County Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=5260)|
| 1:27:45| and the neighborhood could challenge it at that point and the commission could override| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=5265)|
| 1:27:51| or make a final decision different than the recommendation of the Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=5271)|

| 1:33:00| Yes, I looked at this, I'm fairly familiar with it. There, as far as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=5580)|
| 1:33:11| any changes over there, I don't think there's been a change in 25 years. It's a very well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=5591)|
| 1:33:19| It's a very well established neighborhood. There are a couple of apartment buildings in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=5599)|
| 1:33:31| They're either 12, 12 units, something like that, tucked away, but it's a well kept, older neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=5611)|
| 1:33:42| And I just think that bringing multifamily in there, I might say it's 90% single family or more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=5622)|
| 1:33:57| If you look on your map, you'll see that there's single family homes there. There are a couple| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=5637)|
| 1:34:03| apartments mixed in with it. But I don't see any reason for any changes in that area. And| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=5643)|

| 1:34:33| is that that's what he seeks or he seeks RN4?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=5673)|
| 1:34:39| Okay. It's a 1.16 acre site. How many units? Does anybody know how many units he wants to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=5679)|
| 1:34:47| put on there? Does he really need this much density for this small of a site?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=5687)|
| 1:34:54| The staff is Liz Albertson. Ms. Albertson, would you like to respond to Commissioner Smith's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=5694)|
| 1:35:03| question? Sure, I'd be happy to. Yes, Mr. Lanier, he applied for this rezoning under the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=5703)|
| 1:35:12| um, two year window that allows folks that feel that they were down zoned during the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=5712)|
| 1:35:22| rezoning or the recode update the new zoning ordinance for the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=5722)|

| 1:35:35| he has an existing triplex at this location. And if you look at the existing land use in that area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=5735)|
| 1:35:41| you'll see that several other homes that sort of look like single family residential homes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=5741)|
| 1:35:47| are also actually triplexes. And then you'll also see that there is just, you know, existing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=5747)|
| 1:35:54| multifamily in that area. And, you know, probably some of that was done under the previous R2| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=5754)|
| 1:36:02| residential zoning. The RN1 does not allow consideration of multifamily. The way this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=5762)|
| 1:36:08| property is split up now is a house. And it is, you know, this zoning to RN3 would allow him to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=5768)|
| 1:36:23| retain the capacity to have development potential for the property of townhomes. If anything were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=5783)|
| 1:36:34| to happen to this, you know, in the future. But, you know, so he, you know, was feeling down zoned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=5794)|
| 1:36:43| by the recode process and wanted to, you know, get something that was compatible with that. I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=5803)|
| 1:36:50| will note that he is also within a 10th of a mile of a transit stop. Okay, I mean, I just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=5810)|
| 1:36:58| didn't understand it at first. But I guess, you know, if he was shortchanged by recode,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=5818)|
| 1:37:03| and this gets him back to where he was before, then then I'm, I'm okay with that, as long as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=5823)|
| 1:37:09| we're not making it more than it was before. No, we are not. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=5829)|
| 1:37:16| Thank you, Commissioner. Thank you, those. Commissioner Corbett,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=5836)|
| 1:37:19| like you had your hand up earlier, I see it's down. Do you have a question or comment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=5839)|
| 1:37:23| Yeah, I was wondering,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=5843)|
| 1:37:28| Miss Elmerson said that he had an existing triplex. Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=5848)|
| 1:37:34| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=5854)|
| 1:37:35| Okay, if it was destroyed, would he be considered nonconforming and able to rebuild?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=5855)|
| 1:37:43| So I will defer to city representative, if we have one on the call for this. This is something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=5863)|
| 1:37:50| you know, that we're starting to get questions about pretty regularly, since the new ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=5870)|
| 1:37:54| has been adopted. It's my understanding that he could request a zoning certification letter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=5874)|
| 1:38:00| that would allow him to rebuild if something happened. So that's my understanding at this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=5880)|
| 1:38:09| point. Okay, does the requested zoning does that allow him to build additional units on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=5889)|
| 1:38:18| property? So it would allow him to build, it would not be multifamily. It would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=5898)|
| 1:38:31| townhomes. So he would have to subdivide the property. And townhome style development could| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=5911)|
| 1:38:40| potentially go into this location, but not multifamily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=5920)|
| 1:38:45| And how many units might that be approximately?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=5925)|
| 1:38:50| At this location? Let's see. Sorry, hang on, let me pull up my| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=5930)|
| 1:38:58| There's not a substantial, very substantial change from really R and R and one, R and three,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=5938)|
| 1:39:13| and definitely from R and three. In comparison to R and two, when we have a comparable zoning map,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=5953)|
| 1:39:23| it shows R and two as even being comparable to R and five in a lot of locations. So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=5963)|
| 1:39:33| hang on, let me get my code pulled back up. R and three allows about 13| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=5973)|
| 1:39:40| growing units an acre in a townhouse style. R and four would allow 20,000 or 20 units per acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=5980)|
| 1:39:48| but in R and four, the maximum parcel size is capped at 40,000 square feet just under an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=5988)|
| 1:39:58| What was the R two he used to have? Oh, sorry. R and two, or the R two, the old R two allowed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=5998)|
| 1:40:05| I believe, up to 24 dwelling units an acre with the, if there were a medium density| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=6005)|

| 1:40:43| I just, I just want to comment that considering that this property was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=6043)|
| 1:40:47| was owned R, R two prior to recode and that it also is close to transit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=6047)|
| 1:40:51| I think that this is appropriate for us to go ahead and approve this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=6051)|

| 1:45:59| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=6359)|
| 1:46:00| Name and address again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=6360)|
| 1:46:02| Okay, my name is Wade Loven.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=6362)|
| 1:46:04| I'm with MBI Companies, 299 Northwest Garber, Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=6364)|
| 1:46:11| The goal here is a cemetery and so the original zone was open space| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=6371)|
| 1:46:16| and my client would like to build a crematory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=6376)|
| 1:46:22| And there's only one other in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=6382)|
| 1:46:27| So the goal is to have a zone that allows that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=6387)|
| 1:46:32| and there are only two other zones that do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=6392)|
| 1:46:36| But they didn't want to rezone the entire piece of property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=6396)|
| 1:46:41| and nobody wanted that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=6401)|
| 1:46:43| So I submitted a plat to separate a small piece of their property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=6403)|
| 1:46:48| and the goal is to rezone that to be in compliance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=6408)|
| 1:46:54| and eventually asking for a use on review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=6414)|
| 1:46:58| a special use for the new zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=6418)|
| 1:47:04| I can reserve the rest for any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=6424)|
| 1:47:06| Thank you, Mr. Loven.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=6426)|

| 1:47:44| I can't remember, it's an industrial zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=6464)|
| 1:47:48| that doesn't fit right here because of the road frontage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=6468)|

| 1:53:19| I just wanted to say that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=6799)|
| 1:53:24| my biggest concern is the planning in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=6804)|
| 1:53:26| Do I have some feedback from you all?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=6806)|
| 1:53:28| Can you hear me well?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=6808)|

| 1:53:36| All right, I thought so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=6816)|
| 1:53:37| I'll give some feedback.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=6817)|
| 1:53:39| Anyway, there's quite a few people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=6819)|
| 1:53:40| that are wanting to talk, so I'll be brief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=6820)|
| 1:53:43| Do you all have the slides that I sent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=6823)|
| 1:53:45| as far as the flooding?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=6825)|
| 1:53:51| Do you have the slides of the pictures| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=6831)|
| 1:53:53| that I sent of the flooding?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=6833)|
| 1:53:56| Ms. Albertson, can you respond to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=6836)|
| 1:53:58| Yes, they should be on the public comment section| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=6838)|
| 1:54:02| of the website.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=6842)|

| 1:54:07| should be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=6847)|
| 1:54:07| I believe you all received her email| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=6847)|
| 1:54:12| with the photos attached.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=6852)|
| 1:54:15| Thank you, Ms. Albertson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=6855)|
| 1:54:17| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=6857)|
| 1:54:18| Yeah, so if you could pull those up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=6858)|
| 1:54:20| and look at those as I talk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=6860)|
| 1:54:22| I just wanna say that we've had quite a bit of flooding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=6862)|
| 1:54:25| especially the last two years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=6865)|
| 1:54:28| and those pictures speak a thousand words.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=6868)|
| 1:54:33| We are actually not even in the floodplain,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=6873)|
| 1:54:37| but it's amazing how much water| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=6877)|
| 1:54:39| that we have received.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=6879)|
| 1:54:42| I would just like to say also,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=6882)|
| 1:54:44| does anybody live in the Carnes area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=6884)|
| 1:54:47| that knows of this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=6887)|
| 1:54:48| or they're familiar with the flooding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=6888)|
| 1:54:50| besides our County Commissioner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=6890)|
| 1:54:56| Do you know of anybody that does?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=6896)|
| 1:54:59| I just wanted to say that there is so much flooding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=6899)|
| 1:55:03| out here that somebody needs to come out here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=6903)|
| 1:55:06| and look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=6906)|
| 1:55:09| There is proposal that there is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=6909)|
| 1:55:12| you said five houses per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=6912)|
| 1:55:15| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=6915)|
| 1:55:16| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=6916)|
| 1:55:18| And this is on 8.76 acres| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=6918)|
| 1:55:22| that are permitted for houses?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=6922)|
| 1:55:24| It's on a 19.6 acre tract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=6924)|
| 1:55:28| Okay, so how much of that is floodplain, sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=6928)|
| 1:55:34| Liz, can you answer her question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=6934)|
| 1:55:35| Yes, I can chime in here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=6935)|
| 1:55:39| So there's a little bit of a difference here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=6939)|
| 1:55:42| in that there's also floodway zoning on this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=6942)|
| 1:55:45| That floodway zoning is proposed to stay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=6945)|
| 1:55:50| as part of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=6950)|
| 1:55:52| And the floodway zone is 8.22 acres of the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=6952)|
| 1:55:57| So the remaining portion of the site| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=6957)|
| 1:56:00| that is out of the floodway zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=6960)|
| 1:56:02| that they're requesting to rezone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=6962)|
| 1:56:04| to planned residential is 11.46 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=6964)|
| 1:56:09| So that's what staff would base| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=6969)|
| 1:56:12| a density analysis on for this site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=6972)|
| 1:56:18| So a survey obviously could influence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=6978)|
| 1:56:25| how many acres are actually out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=6985)|
| 1:56:28| what the specific number is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=6988)|
| 1:56:30| But we likely wouldn't know for sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=6990)|
| 1:56:33| until the Yukon Preview process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=6993)|
| 1:56:35| But right now, about 57 units would be the maximum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=6995)|
| 1:56:38| When is that gonna be done as far as that study?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=6998)|
| 1:56:41| So we talked to the Knox County Engineering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=7001)|
| 1:56:45| and I have a completely different map| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=7005)|
| 1:56:47| that I've also included with my pictures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=7007)|
| 1:56:49| And so that is not really what the picture that I have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=7009)|
| 1:56:53| It paints actually almost a quarter of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=7013)|
| 1:56:57| And it has that 100-acre and 500-year floodplain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=7017)|
| 1:57:07| shown in the picture that I provided| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=7027)|
| 1:57:09| when I sent that to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=7029)|
| 1:57:13| And my time is short here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=7033)|
| 1:57:15| but I'm gonna get to the point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=7035)|
| 1:57:17| I just need to know what are the studies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=7037)|
| 1:57:21| that have been done as far as this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=7041)|
| 1:57:24| I'm not even in the floodplain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=7044)|
| 1:57:26| and I get major flooding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=7046)|
| 1:57:27| And we have major flooding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=7047)|
| 1:57:29| all up and down Oak Ridge Highways,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=7049)|
| 1:57:30| all the houses that are backed up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=7050)|
| 1:57:32| We have pictures on both sides of the creek| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=7052)|
| 1:57:35| that show all of the flooding that's taking place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=7055)|
| 1:57:39| And I don't know, I'd like to see some of this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=7059)|
| 1:57:44| the impact that's going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=7064)|
| 1:57:46| And when these proposed buildings are going up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=7066)|
| 1:57:51| what's gonna happen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=7071)|
| 1:57:51| Where's all this water gonna go?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=7071)|
| 1:57:55| Thank you for pulling that up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=7075)|
| 1:57:57| So the first one right there shows,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=7077)|
| 1:57:59| that's the back of the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=7079)|
| 1:58:01| the proposed subdivision, the proposed rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=7081)|
| 1:58:08| How do you build on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=7088)|
| 1:58:10| Okay, and the second picture is my house from my view.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=7090)|
| 1:58:14| That's before the flood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=7094)|
| 1:58:17| The third picture is after.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=7097)|
| 1:58:20| The fourth one is before, the next one is after.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=7100)|
| 1:58:26| Okay, the next picture down there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=7106)|
| 1:58:28| that's actually, that's part of that property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=7108)|
| 1:58:31| that's the proposed building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=7111)|
| 1:58:34| On the last picture right there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=7114)|
| 1:58:38| is the other side of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=7118)|
| 1:58:40| That's where the horse farm is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=7120)|
| 1:58:42| And this has happened numerous times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=7122)|
| 1:58:47| I just don't know how you can build on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=7127)|
| 1:58:50| And I need to let other people talk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=7130)|
| 1:58:52| I've asked a few questions, so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=7132)|
| 1:58:56| Miss Griffith, would you like to address| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=7136)|
| 1:58:58| the commission, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=7138)|
| 1:59:03| Miss Griffith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=7143)|
| 1:59:08| This is Miss Maples, can I speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=7148)|
| 1:59:10| Okay, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=7150)|
| 1:59:11| We live directly across the street from the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=7151)|
| 1:59:15| And I sent in pictures of flooding the past two years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=7155)|
| 1:59:19| that go far beyond the quote, hundred year floodplain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=7159)|
| 1:59:23| It actually floods all the way up to Miss Marshall's driveway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=7163)|
| 1:59:28| It came almost all the way up to Emory Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=7168)|
| 1:59:31| And that's a concern because if they build it up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=7171)|
| 1:59:34| it's gonna impact other neighborhoods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=7174)|
| 1:59:35| like Brookhaven, Painter's Farm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=7175)|
| 1:59:39| And the senior center has flooded before| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=7179)|
| 1:59:41| that is downstream.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=7181)|
| 1:59:44| And something has to be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=7184)|
| 1:59:46| The traffic in schools are already an issue out here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=7186)|
| 1:59:49| My daughter, they were not allowed to carry backpacks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=7189)|
| 1:59:52| at Carnes Middle School because it was so overcrowded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=7192)|
| 1:59:54| And to look at 40 to 50 houses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=7194)|
| 1:59:58| adding who knows how many more students to these schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=7198)|
| 2:00:02| is just gonna be a disaster.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=7202)|
| 2:00:06| Thank you, Miss Maples.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=7206)|
| 2:00:09| Do you have any other comments you'd like to make, please,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=7209)|
| 2:00:11| before we go to the applicant?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=7211)|
| 2:00:13| No, can y'all see my flooding pictures| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=7213)|
| 2:00:15| of Miss Marshall's property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=7215)|
| 2:00:16| I sent them what it looks like normally| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=7216)|
| 2:00:20| and then the flooding in last year and this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=7220)|
| 2:00:26| We have a number of pictures in front of us right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=7226)|
| 2:00:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=7229)|
| 2:00:30| When do you think you all would do the flooding study?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=7230)|
| 2:00:34| The environmental impact, when would that be done?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=7234)|
| 2:00:39| This is Liz Albertson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=7239)|
| 2:00:42| I'm staff on this application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=7242)|
| 2:00:45| I will defer to representatives from Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=7245)|
| 2:00:50| related to flooding and stormwater issues out in this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=7250)|
| 2:00:58| This is Leo McCamber with Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=7258)|
| 2:01:01| 205 West Baxter Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=7261)|
| 2:01:03| Out of the 20 acres,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=7263)|
| 2:01:05| there's only 8.75 approximately that can be developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=7265)|
| 2:01:10| It's the, that would be the part that's above.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=7270)|
| 2:01:17| You can't build in either the floodway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=7277)|
| 2:01:19| or the inner half of the 100-year floodplain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=7279)|
| 2:01:22| So you can build on the outer half| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=7282)|
| 2:01:24| of the 100-year floodplain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=7284)|
| 2:01:25| and the part that's naturally above| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=7285)|
| 2:01:27| the 100-year floodplain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=7287)|
| 2:01:28| That leaves only about 8.75 acres out of the 20| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=7288)|
| 2:01:33| so it would be, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=7293)|
| 2:01:34| if they get five per unit based on the 20 acres,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=7294)|
| 2:01:37| it would be...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=7297)|
| 2:01:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=7301)|
| 2:01:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=7303)|
| 2:01:44| And I just, I've got a quick question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=7304)|
| 2:01:47| Who is S&E Properties?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=7307)|
| 2:01:49| Who owns S&E Properties?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=7309)|
| 2:01:56| We don't, we don't know who owns it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=7316)|
| 2:01:58| Oh, Scott Smith and Eric Mosley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=7318)|
| 2:02:02| I'm sorry, who?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=7322)|
| 2:02:04| Scott Smith and Eric Mosley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=7324)|
| 2:02:06| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=7326)|
| 2:02:09| And Mr. Smith has recused himself from this item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=7329)|
| 2:02:14| I'm sure that helps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=7334)|
| 2:02:15| That helps a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=7335)|
| 2:02:20| Did they reevaluate 100-year floodplains?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=7340)|
| 2:02:23| Because with all the new construction around here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=7343)|
| 2:02:26| it's drastically changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=7346)|
| 2:02:29| Because, I mean, the pictures I have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=7349)|
| 2:02:31| show flooding on approximately 19.5 of the acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=7351)|
| 2:02:35| Yeah, they have not reevaluated since 2007, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=7355)|
| 2:02:41| We have the same flood maps from 1983 to 2007.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=7361)|
| 2:02:47| 2007, they were redone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=7367)|
| 2:02:48| They did a little part of the county again in 2013,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=7368)|
| 2:02:52| but not Beaver Creek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=7372)|
| 2:02:55| And it's the federal government that does these flood studies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=7375)|
| 2:02:58| It's FEMA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=7378)|
| 2:02:59| Okay, so it's FEMA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=7379)|
| 2:03:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=7380)|
| 2:03:01| And then perhaps before this is voted on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=7381)|
| 2:03:05| maybe you need to redo that study| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=7385)|
| 2:03:06| because of all the building that has occurred.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=7386)|
| 2:03:11| Well, all the building that has occurred in Carnes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=7391)|
| 2:03:14| the water should continue to rise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=7394)|
| 2:03:17| Yeah, well, it's the federal government| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=7397)|
| 2:03:19| that does the restudies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=7399)|
| 2:03:22| When there's money available,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=7402)|
| 2:03:23| they do consult us about areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=7403)|
| 2:03:25| we would be interested in studying again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=7405)|
| 2:03:28| The last time we had a restudy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=7408)|
| 2:03:31| we did Kona Creek, which is the Hardin Valley area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=7411)|
| 2:03:35| Could there possibly be a hold on this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=7415)|
| 2:03:37| until FEMA reevaluates the floodplain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=7417)|
| 2:03:39| for the betterment of the Carnes community and wildlife?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=7419)|
| 2:03:44| Well, I guess that would be up to the Planning Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200709?start=7424)|
