| 0:08:09| I just want to echo the comments of Chairman Strickland.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=489)|
| 0:08:12| It's a very important topic that we need to handle here in this community, the greater Knox County, city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=492)|
| 0:08:22| I think talking about this time of year, you know, being Christmas and the true meaning of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=502)|
| 0:08:34| and we need to be giving back those that are more fortunate to take care of these folks that have been dealt maybe the worst lot of us in this area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=514)|
| 0:08:48| and we need to figure out the best way to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=528)|
| 0:08:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=532)|
| 0:08:53| Also, I note that Mayor Haslam is here with us and also Mayor Ragsdale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=533)|
| 0:08:57| Would either of you gentlemen care to address the body at this time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=537)|
| 0:09:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=541)|
| 0:09:02| Thank you for being with us here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=542)|
| 0:09:04| The purpose is for us to discuss the homeless, ten-year homeless plan for the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=544)|
| 0:09:08| Mr. Lawler had contacted myself and Chairman Strickland regarding the need for the workshop, which we think is timely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=548)|
| 0:09:16| Before we have Mr. Lawler come forward, are there any comments from any member of commission or council at this time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=556)|
| 0:09:24| And also, we don't have lights, so anyone who wishes to be recognized, just please raise your hand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=564)|
| 0:09:29| You know, note that I'm wearing glasses, so it may take me a while to focus in on you, but I'll do my best to recognize you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=569)|
| 0:09:35| And if you're going to talk, please press the button and speak into the mic so we can record it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=575)|
| 0:09:39| And Commissioner Brown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=579)|
| 0:09:42| Yes, my understanding was that our purpose for our meeting tonight was to try to come to some kind of agreement on some of the areas that these things need to be placed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=582)|
| 0:09:50| not necessarily to rehash some of the stuff we've had before on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=590)|
| 0:09:55| So that was my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=595)|
| 0:09:57| Well, you know, we need to be looking at where we need to put these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=597)|
| 0:10:00| I think ultimately, and Mr. Lawler can address this, please, at the very beginning of your discussion, I think that is our ultimate goal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=600)|
| 0:10:07| I think some backdrop of history, I think it's what they request to be able to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=607)|
| 0:10:12| I, too, think we ultimately need to define our criteria and standards by which we're going to make these decisions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=612)|
| 0:10:19| and that may not be done out of this actual meeting today, but I think that's what we need to ultimately get to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=619)|
| 0:10:24| But we're going to allow Mr. Lawler to give us a brief overview,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=624)|
| 0:10:30| and also I believe he has an individual here with him, Commissioner Becker, I mean City Councilman Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=630)|
| 0:10:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=636)|
| 0:10:38| I guess, you know, while I think the sightings were important,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=638)|
| 0:10:41| I think we need to aim a little higher on how we make sure that these things become effective where they're sighted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=641)|
| 0:10:47| If we locate them in the right places and they're badly run, I think it's a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=647)|
| 0:10:51| So I think we have to aim higher in what we come out of on this and just where they go,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=651)|
| 0:10:55| but how they run effectively for, frankly, the next 20 or 30 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=655)|
| 0:11:00| Both very good points, and also I suspect that we will not resolve all issues tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=660)|
| 0:11:06| Hopefully what we will do is have a good presentation, a good discussion, get a lot of good questions on the table,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=666)|
| 0:11:12| and a process by which we're going to get to the point of Commissioner Brown, which is, you know, and Commissioner Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=672)|
| 0:11:19| Not only is how we're going to determine where permanent housing could be situated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=679)|
| 0:11:24| but also how do we make sure that the integrity of neighborhoods are protected| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=684)|
| 0:11:28| while also the efficacy of the programs are achieved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=688)|
| 0:11:31| So at this juncture, Mr. Lawler, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=691)|
| 0:11:40| A lot of wires up here. I hope I don't unplug the unnecessary ones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=700)|
| 0:11:43| First of all, Vice Mayor Brown, Commissioner Strickland, other members of Council and Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=703)|
| 0:11:51| thank you for allowing us to do this tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=711)|
| 0:11:54| Let me tell you what our objective is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=714)|
| 0:11:57| First of all, I'd like to spend probably seven minutes talking to you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=717)|
| 0:12:01| kind of contextualizing the comments you're going to hear from Tim Clount from the Corporation for Supportive Housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=721)|
| 0:12:08| I want to contextualize those by reminding you how permanent supportive housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=728)|
| 0:12:13| fits within the ultimate primary strategy of the 10-year plan to end chronic homelessness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=733)|
| 0:12:19| And let me do that, first of all, by just giving you a little bit of history.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=739)|
| 0:12:24| In October 2005, Mayor Ragsdale and Mayor Haslam both endorsed the 10-year plan to end chronic homelessness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=744)|
| 0:12:31| Shortly after that, Dr. Roger Noe, I don't think he was conjoled into doing it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=751)|
| 0:12:37| but I think he was heavily persuaded into providing leadership to the 10-year plan for a year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=757)|
| 0:12:42| until one of the mayors found someone to step in and try to take it forward from where Dr. Noe had taken that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=762)|
| 0:12:50| And in June of 2007, I did that very thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=770)|
| 0:12:56| The primary strategy, first of all, is the 10-year plan to end chronic homelessness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=776)|
| 0:13:04| And we've talked about this several times, but every day someone will say to me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=784)|
| 0:13:09| boy, ending homelessness sure is a big goal for 10 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=789)|
| 0:13:13| And it would be an impossible goal for 10 years, because 10 years from now we will still have homelessness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=793)|
| 0:13:18| But the goal is to end chronic homelessness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=798)|
| 0:13:21| And a chronically homeless individual is a disabled individual who's been homeless for more than a year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=801)|
| 0:13:27| or had four serious bouts of homelessness over a three-year period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=807)|
| 0:13:32| These individuals are targeted for two reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=812)|
| 0:13:35| One, they are costly to our system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=815)|
| 0:13:37| And Tim Clont will elaborate on how costly they really are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=817)|
| 0:13:41| But secondly, and you really need to hear this, these individuals without assistance, without support,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=821)|
| 0:13:49| really will not be successful in getting out of their homelessness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=829)|
| 0:13:54| And there are several different reasons behind that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=834)|
| 0:13:58| but primarily because of mental illness-related issues, addiction issues, and other issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=838)|
| 0:14:04| these individuals cannot get out of homelessness on their own.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=844)|
| 0:14:08| And in the end, we're talking about 6 to 800 members of our population here in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=848)|
| 0:14:15| So the plan is to end homelessness for that population over the next 10 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=855)|
| 0:14:21| The plan has a real simple strategy, and it's called Housing First.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=861)|
| 0:14:27| What homeless service providers started discovering, let's say, 8, 10 years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=867)|
| 0:14:33| was our old methodology of trying to end homelessness is not working.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=873)|
| 0:14:37| The new methodology is the belief that the best way to end homelessness for a chronically homeless individual| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=877)|
| 0:14:44| is to immediately get them into housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=884)|
| 0:14:47| That's why we call it Housing First.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=887)|
| 0:14:49| And then surround them with supportive services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=889)|
| 0:14:52| Those services are delivered to them to help them succeed in housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=892)|
| 0:14:56| And this is not a local idea, though we would like to take credit for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=896)|
| 0:15:00| This is a national idea, and it is showing national success.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=900)|
| 0:15:05| Eighty percent of all chronically homeless individuals that go into permanent supportive housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=905)|
| 0:15:10| are still there a year later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=910)|
| 0:15:12| And it's showing local success, and you need to really understand this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=912)|
| 0:15:16| Though we don't have an ample supply of permanent supportive housing right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=916)|
| 0:15:21| in the past two years, one organization, service provider in Knoxville alone, just one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=921)|
| 0:15:26| has successively housed 144 individuals in permanent supportive housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=926)|
| 0:15:33| That same service provider looked back five years ago and at the end of the year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=933)|
| 0:15:38| and felt like they were lucky if they housed five successfully.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=938)|
| 0:15:42| So this strategy is working nationally and it's working locally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=942)|
| 0:15:46| But there is a huge challenge, and the challenge is what we're here to talk about tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=946)|
| 0:15:51| We at the 10-Year Plan have been commissioned to develop permanent supportive housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=951)|
| 0:15:56| We're not going to do the development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=956)|
| 0:15:57| We have a development partner that's going to wake up every day thinking about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=957)|
| 0:16:01| But in order to develop permanent supportive housing on a scattered site basis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=961)|
| 0:16:05| and that's what the plan contemplates,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=965)|
| 0:16:07| we have to be able to have some understanding among all the major stakeholders| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=967)|
| 0:16:14| of how you look at the siting considerations and you serve the interest of all those stakeholders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=974)|
| 0:16:20| Because the interest of a neighborhood and neighbors in that neighborhood may be different than a developer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=980)|
| 0:16:27| but we really have to come up with some common definitions behind these siting considerations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=987)|
| 0:16:35| that serve all the stakeholders' interests.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=995)|
| 0:16:38| So these are the two things our office needs out of tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=998)|
| 0:16:41| And, again, I appreciate each of you being here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=1001)|
| 0:16:44| and we're going to aim to get you out of here by 630 because we know the lady vols tip off at 7.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=1004)|
| 0:16:49| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=1009)|
| 0:16:50| I know that's where Mike Hammond is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=1010)|
| 0:16:52| But here are the two things we need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=1012)|
| 0:16:54| First, we've asked Tim Klont to come in from the Corporation for Supportive Housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=1014)|
| 0:17:00| Tim knows more about supportive housing than anyone in my office, obviously,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=1020)|
| 0:17:05| and he's part of an organization that knows more about this product than any other organization nationally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=1025)|
| 0:17:12| Arguably true, and I believe it is true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=1032)|
| 0:17:15| I want you to take advantage of Tim tonight and really ask him all the questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=1035)|
| 0:17:21| Hear his presentation, learn from his presentation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=1041)|
| 0:17:24| but ask him all the questions you need to ask him to make sure when you leave here tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=1044)|
| 0:17:28| you understand what permanent supportive housing is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=1048)|
| 0:17:32| And then, secondly, this is my biggest request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=1052)|
| 0:17:35| I want a few of you from council and commission to consider serving on a task force that we'll put together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=1055)|
| 0:17:43| And the charge to this task force is going to be to get with all the stakeholders, neighborhood groups,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=1063)|
| 0:17:50| developers, people who provide supportive services, people who will be served in this housing, our office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=1070)|
| 0:17:57| And we are going to look at these siting considerations, and Tim's going to elaborate on what those are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=1077)|
| 0:18:03| and we will work serving the interest of every group at the table to define those considerations in such a way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=1083)|
| 0:18:11| that the interest of everyone is served well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=1091)|
| 0:18:14| So we'll have neighborhood representation on that task force,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=1094)|
| 0:18:18| hopefully members from council and commission, and the other stakeholders that need to be represented there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=1098)|
| 0:18:24| So that's my big request at the end of this meeting, that several of you will agree to serve on that task force.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=1104)|
| 0:18:30| Without taking any more time, I would love to turn the mic over to Tim.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=1110)|
| 0:18:35| Mr. Lawler?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=1115)|
| 0:18:36| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=1116)|
| 0:18:37| Does that task force, is that the same thing as your advisory board or in addition to your advisory board?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=1117)|
| 0:18:41| Why not just use your current advisory board for that purpose?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=1121)|
| 0:18:44| The advisory board was set up to provide advisory services to the 10-year plan office regarding all the strategies of the 10-year plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=1124)|
| 0:18:53| The use of permanent or the housing first model is one of those strategies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=1133)|
| 0:18:58| and we felt like it would be best if we could pull away a group that really is interested in this aspect more than any other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=1138)|
| 0:19:10| and create the task force out of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=1150)|
| 0:19:12| And that way we probably would be able to involve more neighborhood representatives| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=1152)|
| 0:19:17| and then some stakeholders that aren't currently on the advisory board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=1157)|
| 0:19:22| Because I think we have to make sure we have all the stakeholders on that task force in order for the product to be the right product.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=1162)|
| 0:19:29| Tim?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=1169)|
| 0:19:31| And as Tim comes forward, come forward, Tim.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=1171)|
| 0:19:34| As Tim comes forward, just another housekeeping measure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=1174)|
| 0:19:37| The reason we don't have any other nameplates out is we weren't sure where everybody was going to sit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=1177)|
| 0:19:41| and also we discovered that the commission nameplates aren't kept down here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=1181)|
| 0:19:45| I think they're actually kept in the commission office, so that's why we don't have nameplates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=1185)|
| 0:19:49| So I'll do my best to recognize everybody by name, but that's the reason we don't have any other nameplates out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=1189)|
| 0:19:55| Go ahead, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=1195)|
| 0:19:57| Well, thank you all for having me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=1197)|
| 0:19:58| As Mr. Lawler said, my name is Tim Klont.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=1198)|
| 0:20:00| I'm with the Corporation for Supportive Housing, or we use our acronym CSH.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=1200)|
| 0:20:06| CSH has been around for about 18 years now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=1206)|
| 0:20:09| We're a national nonprofit community development intermediary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=1209)|
| 0:20:13| And what that means is we function as the middleman, the go-between, the intermediary, between generally two systems,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=1213)|
| 0:20:20| that being the public systems, so our federal, state, and local partners, as well as our provider partners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=1220)|
| 0:20:27| whether they be housing or service providers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=1227)|
| 0:20:30| We were founded in 1991 really as an offshoot of the Ford Foundation initially,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=1230)|
| 0:20:36| and to really focus on supportive housing as a way to end chronic homelessness in New York City,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=1236)|
| 0:20:42| so a very small niche of the population in a very large city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=1242)|
| 0:20:46| And what we've learned almost 18 years later and through our expansion is that supportive housing really has benefits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=1246)|
| 0:20:52| in both urban and rural areas for chronic and nonchronic homeless populations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=1252)|
| 0:20:56| In fact, CSH has now grown to 14 offices in 11 states and the District of Columbia.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=1256)|
| 0:21:02| So also just to help manage some of your expectations of me and to help frame my presentation to you tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=1262)|
| 0:21:08| I'm really here to speak to you about the benefits of supportive housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=1268)|
| 0:21:12| especially those that we've seen in our history and our work around the country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=1272)|
| 0:21:16| And I think it's especially important because supportive housing and the housing-first approach is really a cornerstone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=1276)|
| 0:21:22| it's a foundation of your plan to end homelessness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=1282)|
| 0:21:26| So I believe you all have the presentation in front of you, and we're also showing it up here, of course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=1286)|
| 0:21:31| Just to put it into context, supportive housing and specifically housing-first into context,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=1291)|
| 0:21:37| what you are seeing is really the traditional homeless system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=1297)|
| 0:21:41| All the way to the left in the circle, you have an individual or a household who's in crisis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=1301)|
| 0:21:47| Something has happened and has caused them to be homeless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=1307)|
| 0:21:50| In the traditional system, their first point of entry is into an emergency shelter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=1310)|
| 0:21:56| They need a safe, dry, warm place to sleep that night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=1316)|
| 0:21:59| Most emergency shelters will shelter them for about 12 hours a day, maybe for up to 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=1319)|
| 0:22:05| And then from there, they may move into a transitional shelter for about 120 days where they're triaged,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=1325)|
| 0:22:11| some basic case management, intake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=1331)|
| 0:22:14| From there, they may go into transitional housing for about two years, some additional services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=1334)|
| 0:22:19| And then when they're deemed housing-ready or they can graduate, they go into permanent housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=1339)|
| 0:22:23| What the housing-first model suggests is that the fastest way to end homelessness| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=1343)|
| 0:22:28| is not to have those individuals cycle through the systems that they may or may not even need,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=1348)|
| 0:22:34| but it's to take them from homelessness and to put them into housing as soon as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=1354)|
| 0:22:39| That doesn't imply that there's no need ever for emergency shelter or even transitional.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=1359)|
| 0:22:46| It's just saying that no longer use those as mandatory stopping points along the way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=1366)|
| 0:22:53| So the housing-first approach really rests on two central premises.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=1373)|
| 0:22:56| The best way to end homelessness is moving individuals from homelessness into permanent housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=1376)|
| 0:23:01| And then once they're in the housing, it's wrapping whatever services they need to stabilize them in housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=1381)|
| 0:23:09| So it really is the combination of housing and services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=1389)|
| 0:23:13| And so our definition, the CSH definition of supportive housing is housing that is permanent and affordable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=1393)|
| 0:23:20| combined with a range of supportive services for people with special needs to live stable and independent lives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=1400)|
| 0:23:29| And so what I'm going to share with you tonight is all predicated on our definition of supportive housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=1409)|
| 0:23:34| understanding that it often looks a little different in communities around the country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=1414)|
| 0:23:38| But I suggest to you that there are really the essential features of supportive housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=1418)|
| 0:23:42| First, it's the housing. The housing is permanent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=1422)|
| 0:23:45| That means the individual is in the housing for as long as they want or need to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=1425)|
| 0:23:50| It's deeply affordable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=1430)|
| 0:23:53| Generally speaking, a true test of housing affordability means it's 30 percent of your monthly income for your housing expense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=1433)|
| 0:24:01| And that's whether you're low income or high income. It's a general rule of thumb in the industry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=1441)|
| 0:24:05| So in order for supportive housing to be deeply affordable to a homeless population who may make $100 a month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=1445)|
| 0:24:12| you know, 30 percent of that is $30.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=1452)|
| 0:24:14| So it needs to be deeply affordable and independent, meaning the tenant has a lease with full rights and responsibilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=1454)|
| 0:24:22| The other half of the supportive housing, of course, is the services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=1462)|
| 0:24:25| The services are flexible, meaning the services that I need are very different than the services that you need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=1465)|
| 0:24:30| But whatever that tenant needs for housing stability is made available and accessible to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=1470)|
| 0:24:35| Our definition of supportive housing includes voluntary services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=1475)|
| 0:24:39| That means I make all of the services available to you, but your participation is voluntary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=1479)|
| 0:24:46| So the way that we like to say this actually is tenant participation is voluntary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=1486)|
| 0:24:51| Service provider provision is mandatory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=1491)|
| 0:24:55| So the service provider always has to be there, ready, willing, and able to provide accessible services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=1495)|
| 0:25:00| That part's mandatory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=1500)|
| 0:25:02| The tenant participation is voluntary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=1502)|
| 0:25:06| And again, the services are independent, and they're almost always focused on housing stability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=1506)|
| 0:25:14| So why do we need supportive housing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=1514)|
| 0:25:16| You know, depending on what national figures you look at, on any given night we have about 1.5 million homeless individuals and families| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=1516)|
| 0:25:22| sleeping on the streets or otherwise precariously housed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=1522)|
| 0:25:27| We really use supportive housing as the intervention and as a way to end chronic homelessness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=1527)|
| 0:25:32| As Mr. Lawler defined chronic homelessness, an individual living on the street for at least one consecutive year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=1532)|
| 0:25:38| or has four episodes of homelessness over the course of three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=1538)|
| 0:25:43| And supportive housing, again, was looked at as a way to actually end homelessness as opposed to managing homelessness,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=1543)|
| 0:25:50| which is what so many communities have been doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=1550)|
| 0:25:52| They've been dealing with the problem or managing the problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=1552)|
| 0:25:54| They haven't really gotten to the root of the homelessness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=1554)|
| 0:25:57| And by doing that, we have created cycles or revolving doors in many of our public systems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=1557)|
| 0:26:04| You know, the psych hospitals, the jails, the prisons, you know, the emergency shelters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=1564)|
| 0:26:10| And we're spending an awful lot of money on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=1570)|
| 0:26:12| You know, I have some national figures, but I learned one recently by Dr. Noe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=1572)|
| 0:26:17| based on some research that was done a few years ago, that your public systems cost about $37,000 a year for a homeless individual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=1577)|
| 0:26:26| So it's substantial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=1586)|
| 0:26:29| So again, supportive housing, individuals who are chronically homeless,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=1589)|
| 0:26:33| individuals who have cycled through these systems, or maybe they're being discharged from systems or institutions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=1593)|
| 0:26:40| And most critical is without the housing, they cannot and will not take advantage of the services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=1600)|
| 0:26:46| So the housing and services, again, very intertwined, without one, not the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=1606)|
| 0:26:52| So we're talking about chronic homeless individuals with disabilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=1612)|
| 0:26:56| Veterans, a very big population.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=1616)|
| 0:26:58| It's estimated that up to 25% of homeless individuals are U.S. veterans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=1618)|
| 0:27:03| Families, the face of homeless families looks very different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=1623)|
| 0:27:07| You generally will not see homeless families on the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=1627)|
| 0:27:11| They may be sleeping in cars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=1631)|
| 0:27:12| They're in shelters or staying with friends and family or otherwise precariously housed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=1632)|
| 0:27:16| Families tend to be homeless for shorter periods of time, but they still do inevitably cycle through homelessness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=1636)|
| 0:27:25| And to youth, it's estimated that anywhere between 5% and 7% of any youth, regardless of your income bracket,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=1645)|
| 0:27:31| will be homeless at some given point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=1651)|
| 0:27:34| Unfortunately, one of the major contributors to street youth homelessness is the foster care system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=1654)|
| 0:27:41| in which children or youth come out of it at 18 years old, and they have nowhere to go,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=1661)|
| 0:27:46| and they're released into homelessness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=1666)|
| 0:27:48| The reentry population also very significant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=1668)|
| 0:27:51| 650,000 individuals released from state and federal prisons every year, many without a discharge plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=1671)|
| 0:27:59| So the gates of the prison open, and if there's no one there on the other side to receive them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=1679)|
| 0:28:03| they're into homelessness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=1683)|
| 0:28:05| And what do they know?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=1685)|
| 0:28:07| I mean, they know what got them into the system to begin with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=1687)|
| 0:28:10| In individuals living with HIV and AIDS, the prevalence of HIV in the homeless population| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=1690)|
| 0:28:19| is 10 times that of what it is amongst the general population.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=1699)|
| 0:28:23| And if you factor in mental illness, it's 15 times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=1703)|
| 0:28:26| So it's a very real concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=1706)|
| 0:28:29| And I am moving through this relatively quickly because I have quite a bit to cover in a short period of time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=1709)|
| 0:28:34| but if you do have questions, please stop me and let me know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=1714)|
| 0:28:39| So one of the questions that we get often is, who lives in supportive housing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=1719)|
| 0:28:42| So help me put a face on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=1722)|
| 0:28:44| So what you have in front of you is a table from some research that we've done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=1724)|
| 0:28:49| The acronyms across the top probably aren't as important to you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=1729)|
| 0:28:53| but the one that I would really like you to focus is on the last column.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=1733)|
| 0:28:56| The last column is THCH.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=1736)|
| 0:28:58| It's called Taking Healthcare Home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=1738)|
| 0:29:00| And that's an initiative that we, a research evaluation actually,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=1740)|
| 0:29:03| we did in about nine communities and states across the country, urban and rural,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=1743)|
| 0:29:07| including our neighbors to the north in the Commonwealth of Kentucky,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=1747)|
| 0:29:11| to where we actually looked at who lives in supportive housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=1751)|
| 0:29:14| And what we found, 55% of the individuals diagnosed severe mental illness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=1754)|
| 0:29:19| And I say diagnosed because so many of the mental illnesses go undiagnosed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=1759)|
| 0:29:23| Only about a quarter of them with substance abuse disorders| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=1763)|
| 0:29:26| and about another quarter of them with co-occurring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=1766)|
| 0:29:29| The other two evaluations that you'll see,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=1769)|
| 0:29:31| HHISN was predominantly in the San Francisco Bay Area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=1771)|
| 0:29:36| Closer to home was the states of New York and California.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=1776)|
| 0:29:39| So your numbers are a little skewed when you look primarily at urban areas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=1779)|
| 0:29:43| and that's my disclaimer to you, and I'm aware of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=1783)|
| 0:29:46| So I've tried to bring as locally relevant examples as I could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=1786)|
| 0:29:51| The next slide, looking at the demographics,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=1791)|
| 0:29:53| about two-thirds of supportive housing residents male.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=1793)|
| 0:29:57| Some ethnicities overrepresented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=1797)|
| 0:30:01| And when you look at the median and the mean ages, they're in their 40s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=1801)|
| 0:30:07| I mean, I was quite surprised at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=1807)|
| 0:30:09| I would have expected them to be a little bit older.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=1809)|
| 0:30:11| In fact, some of the stats that are coming out now when you factor in family homelessness,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=1811)|
| 0:30:14| the average homeless American is eight years old.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=1814)|
| 0:30:19| So I want to talk to you a little bit about how supportive housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=1819)|
| 0:30:22| how we have seen supportive housing to be an effective strategy in communities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=1822)|
| 0:30:25| that we've worked in, and specifically in three areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=1825)|
| 0:30:28| How it's effective for the residents, how it's effective to public systems,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=1828)|
| 0:30:32| and how it's effective for neighborhoods and communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=1832)|
| 0:30:38| So it's a strategy that works for people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=1838)|
| 0:30:40| You know, you may have heard the tag housing is healthcare,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=1840)|
| 0:30:43| and I would suggest to you that supportive housing certainly is that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=1843)|
| 0:30:46| So we have some stats here from evaluation work that we've done around the country| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=1846)|
| 0:30:50| where we looked pre-supportive housing and post-supportive housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=1850)|
| 0:30:55| What you see here are the figures post-supportive housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=1855)|
| 0:30:57| One-year post-supportive housing, emergency room visits down 57%,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=1857)|
| 0:31:02| emergency detox down 85%, you know, incarceration 50%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=1862)|
| 0:31:07| You have all of these in front of you, but I'm only reading them to you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=1867)|
| 0:31:09| because I think they're quite telling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=1869)|
| 0:31:12| 50% increase in earned income, that's really important not only for the tenant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=1872)|
| 0:31:18| who is on their way to economic self-sufficiency, but also for the housing provider| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=1878)|
| 0:31:22| because theoretically that means that that individual can now afford to pay more rent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=1882)|
| 0:31:26| and therefore doesn't require the rental subsidy that they may have before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=1886)|
| 0:31:31| And one of the stats that we're most proud of that I think is most telling of supportive housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=1891)|
| 0:31:35| is that one year later 80% of those folks are still living in the housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=1895)|
| 0:31:41| What happened to the other 20%?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=1901)|
| 0:31:43| Anyone's guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=1903)|
| 0:31:45| Maybe they didn't like living in a more structured environment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=1905)|
| 0:31:47| Maybe they only needed temporary intervention services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=1907)|
| 0:31:50| and have since moved on to unsupported affordable housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=1910)|
| 0:31:56| But two years out we have success rates in the low 70s,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=1916)|
| 0:31:59| so I suggest to you that it's still a very effective model.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=1919)|
| 0:32:04| So I said it once, I say it again, housing is health care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=1924)|
| 0:32:08| We, again, suggest a model where services are voluntary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=1928)|
| 0:32:12| and we have shown and we have researched that even when services are not a condition of tenancy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=1932)|
| 0:32:19| meaning completely voluntary, 81% of the residents will still utilize health care services,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=1939)|
| 0:32:24| and 80% will still voluntarily access mental health treatment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=1944)|
| 0:32:28| and 56% will access the substance abuse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=1948)|
| 0:32:33| Admittedly, voluntary services tends to be one of the most contentious issues in communities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=1953)|
| 0:32:40| where we work with providers who say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=1960)|
| 0:32:42| but if I don't mandate my residents take part in my mental health treatment program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=1962)|
| 0:32:48| they won't be successful in housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=1968)|
| 0:32:51| And we do work with some providers who have mandated services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=1971)|
| 0:32:55| We see, and they do have greater rates of participation in those services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=1975)|
| 0:33:01| Why? Well, because they're mandatory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=1981)|
| 0:33:03| But I can tell you that they have lower rates of housing retention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=1983)|
| 0:33:07| If you go out one year, you will have less than 80% of those people still in the housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=1987)|
| 0:33:13| And I also throw in this last stat just because it's very recent, and I think it means a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=1993)|
| 0:33:21| The rates of opportunistic infections of HIV-positive homeless individuals are greatly reduced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=2001)|
| 0:33:26| That's an issue of health care not only for that individual,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=2006)|
| 0:33:29| but it really means a lot in terms of prevention of that infection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=2009)|
| 0:33:36| And so now I'm going to talk to you a little bit about how this is a positive strategy for public systems,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=2016)|
| 0:33:40| basically a cost-benefit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=2020)|
| 0:33:42| Supportive housing is not cheap.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=2022)|
| 0:33:44| It certainly isn't free, but I would like to suggest to you that you would actually realize| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=2024)|
| 0:33:48| greater savings in other public systems should you invest in supportive housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=2028)|
| 0:33:52| And so I have some charts for you to look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=2032)|
| 0:33:55| This particular one I released in 2004.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=2035)|
| 0:33:59| Nine cities across the country, mainly medium and large cities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=2039)|
| 0:34:05| And we took a look at the six most common public systems where a homeless individual might spend a day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=2045)|
| 0:34:15| And if you look all the way to the right, a hospital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=2055)|
| 0:34:17| So we said of these nine cities, which three are the most expensive to spend the day in the hospital?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=2057)|
| 0:34:22| San Francisco, Atlanta, New York, anywhere from $1,200 to $2,000 a day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=2062)|
| 0:34:27| If you go all the way to the other end, which three cities was supportive housing the most expensive?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=2067)|
| 0:34:33| San Francisco, let's say $40 a day, Columbus $30, Phoenix $20.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=2073)|
| 0:34:39| Across the board, supportive housing costs the public system per day much less than anything else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=2079)|
| 0:34:49| So another local example, a city example, the city of Denver.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=2089)|
| 0:34:53| This is really interesting, and one of the reasons why I included this site specifically for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=2093)|
| 0:34:58| This came out in 2006.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=2098)|
| 0:35:00| In 2004, the city of Denver identified 513 chronically homeless individuals living on the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=2100)|
| 0:35:07| And they had heard a little bit about the Housing First model and decided to fund a pilot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=2107)|
| 0:35:11| They said we're going to fund a pilot of 150 Housing First units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=2111)|
| 0:35:15| So of these 513 chronically homeless individuals, we're going to move 150 of them into Housing First, supportive housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=2115)|
| 0:35:22| So the bar that you see on the left, sort of the light purple, is the cost to the public system per individual| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=2122)|
| 0:35:29| for the 24 months prior to them entering supportive housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=2129)|
| 0:35:33| So you can see $10,000 on detox, $13,000 in emergency shelter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=2133)|
| 0:35:39| And now the bar next to it, sort of the magenta color, is the cost to the public system for those same individuals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=2139)|
| 0:35:46| for the 24 months after entering supportive housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=2146)|
| 0:35:51| You can see tremendous savings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=2151)|
| 0:35:53| The gross savings per individual was about $35,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=2153)|
| 0:35:58| And if you multiply that by 150, which I've done, but I can't remember off the top of my head,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=2158)|
| 0:36:06| cost savings of about $4.7 million for that particular pilot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=2166)|
| 0:36:11| Now, had the city been able to fund the 513 Housing First supportive housing units that they really needed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=2171)|
| 0:36:20| it actually would have been a cost savings of about $16 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=2180)|
| 0:36:27| The pilot program was a cost savings of about $4 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=2187)|
| 0:36:30| So I said a cost savings of $35,000 gross across the board for each individual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=2190)|
| 0:36:35| Also, I admit, supportive housing, not free, not inexpensive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=2195)|
| 0:36:40| But even when you factor in the cost of the housing and the services,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=2200)|
| 0:36:43| it was still a public system's cost benefit of $4,000 net per individual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=2203)|
| 0:36:51| So whether you approach this from a moral point of view or a social or a fiscally responsible,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=2211)|
| 0:36:59| I hope that you'll agree that supportive housing really does make a fiduciary sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=2219)|
| 0:37:06| So taking a look at a smaller community up north, Portland, Maine, population of 60,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=2226)|
| 0:37:13| Similar pilot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=2233)|
| 0:37:15| The dollar amounts are going to be smaller because their pilot included 99 chronically homeless individuals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=2235)|
| 0:37:20| But if you focus really down the left side where you see the percentage of the savings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=2240)|
| 0:37:26| in health care and 41% in mental health.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=2246)|
| 0:37:30| Again, so what these communities now are working on is a way to figure out how do you take these cost savings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=2250)|
| 0:37:39| these public systems cost savings, and somehow redirect or reinvest that into the supportive housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=2259)|
| 0:37:49| So I suggest to you, as does some of this research,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=2269)|
| 0:37:53| that supportive housing is actually good for neighborhoods and for communities as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=2273)|
| 0:37:57| I'd like to share with you a recent evaluation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=2277)|
| 0:38:01| It literally was released about three weeks ago, and it's very groundbreaking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=2281)|
| 0:38:05| I admit that it was based and focused solely in New York City, but it is the only study of its kind,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=2285)|
| 0:38:11| which is why I share it with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=2291)|
| 0:38:13| The Furman Center for Real Estate and Urban Policy at New York University| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=2293)|
| 0:38:16| really wanted to establish the impact the supportive housing had on neighboring property values.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=2296)|
| 0:38:22| One of the reasons why I think the study initiated in New York City is because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=2302)|
| 0:38:27| to have a statistically valid, meaningful evaluation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=2307)|
| 0:38:30| you have to have a critical mass of housing units that have been in existence for some period of time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=2310)|
| 0:38:36| where you can make some educated assumptions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=2316)|
| 0:38:38| So in New York, what they did is they looked at 7,500 supportive housing units over the course of 20 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=2318)|
| 0:38:45| I remind you that we started in New York City,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=2325)|
| 0:38:48| probably one of the most sophisticated supportive housing networks in the country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=2328)|
| 0:38:52| Now, of these 7,500 supportive housing units,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=2332)|
| 0:38:55| there were about 125 developments with an average size of about 48.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=2335)|
| 0:38:59| So we're not talking huge developments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=2339)|
| 0:39:02| And what the Furman Center did is they took a look at the property values pre-supportive housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=2342)|
| 0:39:08| So they looked at the properties within 500 feet of the supportive housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=2348)|
| 0:39:12| so within a tenth of a mile, very close.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=2352)|
| 0:39:15| And then they also compared it to their control was the properties within 1,000 feet of the supportive housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=2355)|
| 0:39:22| so about a quarter of a mile.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=2362)|
| 0:39:24| And what they found is that both at the time that the supportive housing opened,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=2364)|
| 0:39:29| and even five years later, there was no adverse impact on the property values.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=2369)|
| 0:39:34| In fact, the housing units within 500 feet of the supportive housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=2374)|
| 0:39:39| actually had greater rates of appreciation five years later than the housing units 1,000 feet out did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=2379)|
| 0:39:48| I could make some guesses why that would happen, as did the Furman Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=2388)|
| 0:39:53| Quite oftentimes, supportive housing ends up getting sited in the most disinvested neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=2393)|
| 0:39:58| It's a vacant lot. It's an abandoned building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=2398)|
| 0:40:01| And so when you come in and put a quality supportive housing development there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=2401)|
| 0:40:05| that's actually a great asset to those properties within 500 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=2405)|
| 0:40:09| And it does have a positive ripple effect 1,000 feet out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=2409)|
| 0:40:12| but not quite nearly the effect that it does within the first 500 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=2412)|
| 0:40:16| Density in the mix of tenancy, meaning whether it was 100 percent of supportive housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=2416)|
| 0:40:21| or if it was a reentry population, or families, really had no impact on the property value.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=2421)|
| 0:40:29| So another one that we refer to quite often, in Philadelphia.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=2429)|
| 0:40:33| And again, these tend to be in larger cities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=2433)|
| 0:40:35| because there's the concentration of the housing there to make some valid assumptions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=2435)|
| 0:40:39| Project Home, they're a nonprofit up in Philadelphia,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=2439)|
| 0:40:43| and they develop transitional housing, supportive housing, and affordable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=2443)|
| 0:40:47| And they wanted to take a look at the impact that they were having on neighborhoods with their investments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=2447)|
| 0:40:51| And so what they found is that immediately following the opening of any of their developments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=2451)|
| 0:40:56| the neighboring property values had no adverse impact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=2456)|
| 0:41:00| So admittedly, they didn't spike, but they also didn't tank.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=2460)|
| 0:41:04| And they went a few years out, and what they found is that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=2464)|
| 0:41:07| compared to similar neighborhoods across the city, where they had made investments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=2467)|
| 0:41:12| their rate of appreciation was actually 6.8 percent versus the citywide average of five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=2472)|
| 0:41:21| And the last one that I'll reference is the Wellesley Institute,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=2481)|
| 0:41:25| in Toronto, and their evaluation was a little bit different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=2485)|
| 0:41:28| Not so much focused on the impact that supportive housing has on property values,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=2488)|
| 0:41:32| but more so the impact that supportive housing has on neighborhoods,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=2492)|
| 0:41:35| and really sort of the character of the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=2495)|
| 0:41:38| One of the things that they found is, you know, the majority of supportive housing tenants don't own cars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=2498)|
| 0:41:43| They have limited incomes, can't afford a car, just have never learned how to drive one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=2503)|
| 0:41:48| So they do a lot of shopping on foot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=2508)|
| 0:41:51| Neighborhood businesses in these neighborhoods absolutely loved the supportive housing residents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=2511)|
| 0:41:55| They're captive, they have a small economic footprint, and they're buying and spending locally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=2515)|
| 0:42:00| They also spend a lot of time walking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=2520)|
| 0:42:03| You may have heard that phrase, eyes on the street, as crime prevention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=2523)|
| 0:42:08| Some of the neighborhoods just loved having the residents out there walking dogs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=2528)|
| 0:42:12| walking to the bus, the grocery store.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=2532)|
| 0:42:14| They also got very involved in their neighborhood associations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=2534)|
| 0:42:18| And interestingly enough, only 45 percent of the neighbors surveyed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=2538)|
| 0:42:23| actually knew that that particular development was supportive housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=2543)|
| 0:42:26| They just thought it was another multifamily apartment building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=2546)|
| 0:42:33| So there are some unique challenges to developing supportive housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=2553)|
| 0:42:38| And there are many different types of supportive housing as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=2558)|
| 0:42:42| Probably right now the most common and the one that you might be most familiar with is a single site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=2562)|
| 0:42:48| So it's one building, it's X number of units, 100 percent of them are supportive housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=2568)|
| 0:42:55| Scattered site is another approach, and it's where units, generally apartment units,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=2575)|
| 0:43:02| are leased throughout a community, throughout a city, a neighborhood, a county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=2582)|
| 0:43:07| and it's a very scattered site approach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=2587)|
| 0:43:09| So you don't have a large concentration in any one particular area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=2589)|
| 0:43:13| The last model is integrated, in which more communities are spending a lot of time and energy around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=2593)|
| 0:43:20| And it's quite often a single building, but you may have 50 percent supportive housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=2600)|
| 0:43:26| and you may have 50 percent affordable housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=2606)|
| 0:43:28| So it's a mix of tendencies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=2608)|
| 0:43:33| And there's a number of different ways you can actually develop supportive housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=2613)|
| 0:43:36| A turnkey approach is just that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=2616)|
| 0:43:38| A provider partners with a for-profit or a non-profit housing developer to actually develop it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=2618)|
| 0:43:44| and then that developer turns the key, literally, for a price, over to that housing provider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=2624)|
| 0:43:51| In a co-development arrangement, the housing provider actually becomes a co-developer with the for or non-profit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=2631)|
| 0:43:58| Master leasing is picking up a lot of steam recently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=2638)|
| 0:44:02| It's where a provider goes into the community, and let's say you have a 100-unit apartment building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=2642)|
| 0:44:08| That provider may go in and say, I'm going to master lease 25 of these units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=2648)|
| 0:44:11| I'll execute one lease, I'll give you one rent check every month, and I want them for five years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=2651)|
| 0:44:17| And then that provider then sublets to their clients, their residents, over the period of that lease.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=2657)|
| 0:44:24| And the master leasing can take place all in one building or it can be a very scattered site approach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=2664)|
| 0:44:29| It's popular because it's a non-development model.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=2669)|
| 0:44:33| You don't have to build anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=2673)|
| 0:44:35| You actually go to housing that already exists, that's available on the open market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=2675)|
| 0:44:39| Service contract is an arrangement where a for or non-profit developer or property owner has some housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=2679)|
| 0:44:48| that they want to make supportive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=2688)|
| 0:44:50| And all that that really then requires is for them to execute a service contract with a provider| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=2690)|
| 0:44:55| to come in and provide those supportive services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=2695)|
| 0:44:57| So, again, what I'm getting at is that the housing physically very rarely looks different,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=2697)|
| 0:45:03| and quite often already exists in your community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=2703)|
| 0:45:06| Especially if you have the affordable component, you're already halfway there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=2706)|
| 0:45:10| What you really just need is that service component.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=2710)|
| 0:45:12| So I've been asked to suggest a few siting considerations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=2712)|
| 0:45:17| and had a number of discussions with some folks here at the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=2717)|
| 0:45:22| At its core, I suggest to you that supportive housing is truly just affordable housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=2722)|
| 0:45:27| and that when you consider where to site affordable housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=2727)|
| 0:45:31| the factors that you consider are really not much different than those that you and I consider| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=2731)|
| 0:45:37| when we decide where we want to live.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=2737)|
| 0:45:39| What's going to be most important?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=2739)|
| 0:45:41| I suggest that you take a look at your existing housing options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=2741)|
| 0:45:44| And that means a couple of different things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=2744)|
| 0:45:47| If your strategy is new development, new construction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=2747)|
| 0:45:50| of course your housing options are going to be vacant land,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=2750)|
| 0:45:53| and ideally land that's already zoned properly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=2753)|
| 0:45:55| If you have some underutilized structures in your community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=2755)|
| 0:45:58| either existing housing or buildings that can be adaptively reused,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=2758)|
| 0:46:04| schools, churches, hospitals, whatnot, those I would consider your housing options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=2764)|
| 0:46:09| You always want to be mindful of the current concentration of affordable housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=2769)|
| 0:46:13| Again, supportive is affordable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=2773)|
| 0:46:15| And so you just want to be mindful of its impact on the smaller neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=2775)|
| 0:46:19| And if you can ever dovetail your supportive housing as part of a broader neighborhood revitalization| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=2779)|
| 0:46:27| or community development strategy, it works really well that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=2787)|
| 0:46:32| I think I gave an example last night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=2792)|
| 0:46:34| We're doing some work with the city of San Diego.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=2794)|
| 0:46:37| They have a downtown redevelopment area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=2797)|
| 0:46:39| And it comes with tax increment financing and some grant money and all of this other stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=2799)|
| 0:46:44| And the city said, you know, we really want some supportive housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=2804)|
| 0:46:48| And so if you're going to build housing within this downtown redevelopment area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=2808)|
| 0:46:52| 10% of the units have to be supportive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=2812)|
| 0:46:55| And so what they did is they made supportive housing part of this broader community development strategy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=2815)|
| 0:47:00| And so, therefore, if anyone's doing housing, 10% of it's affordable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=2820)|
| 0:47:03| And so it's also a great dispersion policy in a way to integrate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=2823)|
| 0:47:07| You want to look at the market and the demand for the housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=2827)|
| 0:47:10| Where are the folks coming from?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=2830)|
| 0:47:12| Where do they need to be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=2832)|
| 0:47:13| And then zoning, of course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=2833)|
| 0:47:15| I'm sure I don't need to remind any of you that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=2835)|
| 0:47:18| all zoning decisions are subject to the Federal Fair Housing Act.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=2838)|
| 0:47:21| And so that if you have existing land that is properly zoned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=2841)|
| 0:47:24| I would suggest to you that that is a site to be considered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=2844)|
| 0:47:29| And then, again, I just put up some quality of life factors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=2849)|
| 0:47:32| Probably not unique to supportive housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=2852)|
| 0:47:34| Again, things that you and I look for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=2854)|
| 0:47:37| Proximity to service providers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=2857)|
| 0:47:38| And this means a few different things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=2858)|
| 0:47:41| Some supportive housing models, and depending on the size and the scope of the project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=2861)|
| 0:47:45| require the resident to travel to where the service provider is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=2865)|
| 0:47:49| So in your community, it's my understanding that you have a number of service providers concentrated in one area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=2869)|
| 0:47:55| And that if you read this and say, well, if I'm going to consider all of my housing be close to them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=2875)|
| 0:48:02| then theoretically all of that housing is going to be in the same neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=2882)|
| 0:48:05| And that's not what I'm suggesting to you at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=2885)|
| 0:48:08| What I would suggest is that you take a look maybe at the service delivery area of that provider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=2888)|
| 0:48:14| Because many times in supportive housing, if the resident is required to travel to the service provider,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=2894)|
| 0:48:20| there's just enough of a disincentive for them not to go and not participate in the services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=2900)|
| 0:48:25| More often than not, services are delivered where the resident is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=2905)|
| 0:48:29| So the case worker, the case manager, the mental health provider is actually going to the supportive housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=2909)|
| 0:48:35| So if you have a service provider with a 20-mile radius,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=2915)|
| 0:48:39| I would suggest to you then that you would consider sites within 20 miles of that service provider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=2919)|
| 0:48:44| It's not always about the resident going to the service provider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=2924)|
| 0:48:47| In fact, this model sort of turns the tables onto that service provider| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=2927)|
| 0:48:51| and puts the responsibility on them to make their services accessible and attractive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=2931)|
| 0:48:59| Proximity to transportation options, they're probably fewer in smaller communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=2939)|
| 0:49:04| Public transportation, of course, ideal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=2944)|
| 0:49:06| But to the extent that you have other modes of transportation for the residents to get to work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=2946)|
| 0:49:11| to get to services and other things that they need to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=2951)|
| 0:49:15| You know, grocery stores, churches, community centers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=2955)|
| 0:49:18| Employment, key.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=2958)|
| 0:49:19| Again, we saw that in supportive housing, rates of employment go up 50%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=2959)|
| 0:49:24| So ideally, you'd want to place them close to places where they could actually work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=2964)|
| 0:49:29| Educational opportunities and open space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=2969)|
| 0:49:32| So again, some pretty common considerations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=2972)|
| 0:49:37| But I think when you start drilling down at the community level,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=2977)|
| 0:49:42| you have to determine what each one of these means to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=2982)|
| 0:49:46| You know, transportation options in a large city is going to be very different than what is going to be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=2986)|
| 0:49:52| So that's all I have for you in terms of presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=2992)|
| 0:49:56| But I'd be happy to respond to any of your questions about the model or our successes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=2996)|
| 0:50:04| Councilman Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=3004)|
| 0:50:26| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=3026)|
| 0:50:45| You are correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=3045)|
| 0:50:48| I would suggest to you that if a provider has placed someone into supportive housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=3048)|
| 0:50:53| and that person is not engaging in services, that that provider is probably there on a daily basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=3053)|
| 0:50:58| And they're doing the best they can to actively engage that individual through whatever means possible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=3058)|
| 0:51:05| and make their services so attractive that the individual wants to participate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=3065)|
| 0:51:09| Remember, first and foremost, we want to get the people off the street and stably housed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=3069)|
| 0:51:13| Because if they're not stably housed, they will not take advantage of the services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=3073)|
| 0:51:18| So it's, you know, I showed you some stats, 80% taking advantage of their health care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=3078)|
| 0:51:25| So most people actually really will take advantage of them if it's easy enough for them to do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=3085)|
| 0:51:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=3107)|
| 0:51:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=3109)|
| 0:52:13| Well, I can't assume, and the study doesn't give this information,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=3133)|
| 0:52:17| I can't assume that every single one of the 135 developments that they looked at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=3137)|
| 0:52:21| were all placed in disinvested or at-risk neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=3141)|
| 0:52:25| They were all in New York City, but they were all throughout the five boroughs as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=3145)|
| 0:52:31| So without going down to a project-by-project basis, I can't give you a specific example,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=3151)|
| 0:52:35| but, again, it's safe to assume, and based on the numbers within the study,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=3155)|
| 0:52:39| that not all of those neighborhoods were disinvested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=3159)|
| 0:52:43| Maybe a better study is the one in Philadelphia, where they looked at the baseline neighborhoods,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=3163)|
| 0:52:50| and it was affordable, and it was transitional and supportive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=3170)|
| 0:53:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=3192)|
| 0:53:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=3213)|
| 0:53:34| Next, I saw Councilman Becker, and then Commissioner Andrews.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=3214)|
| 0:53:36| Councilman Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=3216)|
| 0:53:37| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=3217)|
| 0:53:39| One, just to follow up on your answer to Rob about the voluntary services,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=3219)|
| 0:53:43| when you speak about voluntary services, that's sort of the person might choose to go to a class in this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=3223)|
| 0:53:49| but no matter what, if they're not going out to see people, there are people coming in to see them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=3229)|
| 0:53:55| If there is some level of somebody isn't voluntarily taking advantage of mental health services,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=3235)|
| 0:54:01| somebody is coming to see them to find out why and to try and convince them to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=3241)|
| 0:54:05| Did I hear you right on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=3245)|
| 0:54:07| In a quality supportive housing environment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=3247)|
| 0:54:10| there will be a service provider who is doing their best to actively engage that resident.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=3250)|
| 0:54:15| Someone can only be engaged to the extent that they want to be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=3255)|
| 0:54:19| and there will undoubtedly be situations where a case manager knocks on a door twice a day to no answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=3259)|
| 0:54:24| But I suggest to you that eventually that someone will answer the door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=3264)|
| 0:54:28| So you're right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=3268)|
| 0:54:29| So the service provider never stops attempting just because the person is not engaging.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=3269)|
| 0:54:36| The second question is different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=3276)|
| 0:54:37| It's sort of the size of the facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=3277)|
| 0:54:42| Here in Knoxville, we've talked about ones that are 60 units down to eight units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=3282)|
| 0:54:47| And there's, I suppose, some advantages and disadvantages to both ends of the spectrum,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=3287)|
| 0:54:51| and I guess even larger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=3291)|
| 0:54:53| And I wonder what your thinking is about what's the ideal unit size.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=3293)|
| 0:54:57| Is it best with eight units, best with 100?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=3297)|
| 0:55:00| And what are the pluses and minuses?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=3300)|
| 0:55:03| It really depends on the local market and the neighborhood character.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=3303)|
| 0:55:09| Financing any type of affordable housing, whether it be affordable or supportive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=3309)|
| 0:55:14| there certainly is an economy of scale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=3314)|
| 0:55:18| So we've participated in supportive housing that's a duplex.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=3318)|
| 0:55:23| It's two units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=3323)|
| 0:55:24| And we have done projects over 300 units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=3324)|
| 0:55:28| It really depends on what's the market,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=3328)|
| 0:55:30| what can the neighborhood support, financially what pencils out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=3330)|
| 0:55:34| Oftentimes the larger units or the larger developments tend to be the integrated models.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=3334)|
| 0:55:39| So it's rarely more than 50% supportive and oftentimes less than that in an integrated model.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=3339)|
| 0:55:47| And, again, with the balance of the population being affordable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=3347)|
| 0:55:51| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=3351)|
| 0:55:52| Commissioner Andrews.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=3352)|
| 0:55:53| My question is for Mr. Lawler, if that's appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=3353)|
| 0:55:55| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=3355)|
| 0:55:59| With our program that we're going to be using,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=3359)|
| 0:56:02| I have the same concern with the voluntary versus mandatory that I think everybody up here does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=3362)|
| 0:56:09| Last month you told us it's all about accountability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=3369)|
| 0:56:11| Is our program going to have any voluntary or is it going to be mandatory?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=3371)|
| 0:56:14| Are we just going to give these people an opportunity to succeed with no strings attached| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=3374)|
| 0:56:21| or are we going to hold them accountable?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=3381)|
| 0:56:23| If you don't mind, I'm going to defer to Jenny Weatherstone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=3383)|
| 0:56:26| who's here from Volunteer Ministry Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=3386)|
| 0:56:28| Their role in the 10-year plan is to be the supportive service piece,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=3388)|
| 0:56:32| and we had this very conversation at lunch today with Tim.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=3392)|
| 0:56:35| I'll let her elaborate, but their clever answer was, I probably can't do it, but it was voluntary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=3395)|
| 0:56:43| a mixture between mandatory and voluntary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=3403)|
| 0:56:46| So I'll let Jenny respond to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=3406)|
| 0:56:52| One of the things that I'm going to do in answering this question is spring a little bit from the experience| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=3412)|
| 0:56:57| that we have currently with the Jackson apartments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=3417)|
| 0:57:04| I'm going to use the experience that we currently have with the Jackson apartments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=3424)|
| 0:57:08| which are 16 apartments we operate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=3428)|
| 0:57:11| One of the things that we find with the population that we're working with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=3431)|
| 0:57:15| is that there are barriers for them getting into housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=3435)|
| 0:57:19| The barrier could be as simple as they don't have identification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=3439)|
| 0:57:23| To get that, they have to get a birth certificate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=3443)|
| 0:57:26| Left on their own, they don't know how to do those things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=3446)|
| 0:57:30| The barriers could be more complicated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=3450)|
| 0:57:33| It could involve mental illness, which would render them not able to apply for housing on their own.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=3453)|
| 0:57:41| It could be a criminal record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=3461)|
| 0:57:42| It could be an outstanding KUB bill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=3462)|
| 0:57:45| What we find is that we begin by engaging them before housing has even happened,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=3465)|
| 0:57:53| and our effort is to help them overcome those barriers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=3473)|
| 0:57:57| Once those barriers are overcome, the relationship is already established,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=3477)|
| 0:58:01| and they know that the relationship goes with them into housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=3481)|
| 0:58:06| So that when they're in housing, the very first visit they have is from the case manager.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=3486)|
| 0:58:12| In fact, the case manager is the one that helps them move in, that will help them get furniture,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=3492)|
| 0:58:17| that will help them put the towels in the bathroom, that kind of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=3497)|
| 0:58:21| It becomes assumed on their part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=3501)|
| 0:58:25| So we don't necessarily tell them that it is mandatory,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=3505)|
| 0:58:30| but it becomes just part of the operation of moving into housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=3510)|
| 0:58:34| and that has worked extremely well for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=3514)|
| 0:58:38| We also find where we very much like the idea of what we call irresistible therapy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=3518)|
| 0:58:47| which is very effective with people that are a little bit harder to engage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=3527)|
| 0:58:50| You plan the kind of activities that people want to come to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=3530)|
| 0:58:54| and when they come, whether it is movie night with popcorn or whatever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=3534)|
| 0:58:59| that's when you can begin to start some conversations that maybe they were resisting up to that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=3539)|
| 0:59:06| But for the most part, when our people move into housing, that relationship is already started,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=3546)|
| 0:59:11| and they know, they can expect that it continues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=3551)|
| 0:59:14| Right, there's a relationship, but are we holding them accountable for their actions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=3554)|
| 0:59:18| and let's say we have a 16-unit facility and one person continually has the police up there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=3558)|
| 0:59:26| one person continually is threatening other residents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=3566)|
| 0:59:30| Are we going to do anything with them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=3570)|
| 0:59:33| We hold our residents accountable the very same way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=3573)|
| 0:59:36| They sign a lease, and the requirements of the lease are the requirements that would be there in any kind of a lease,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=3576)|
| 0:59:43| and they are held to those requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=3583)|
| 0:59:45| I had a follow-up question for Mr. Lawler. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=3585)|
| 0:59:54| The other question I have is, and I haven't spoken with Mr. Nance or anybody with Knox County Housing Authority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=3594)|
| 1:00:02| I think it would be easier for me to swallow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=3602)|
| 1:00:04| I believe the plan works. I believe that it's workable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=3604)|
| 1:00:09| But I think a pilot program, if we saw a small scale,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=3609)|
| 1:00:12| let's say we took one floor of all of the high rises that KCDC has,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=3612)|
| 1:00:17| and we have residents on that floor that's, they're the only ones that can get there with their key card or whatever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=3617)|
| 1:00:24| however we do the elevators, and we see that the plan works,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=3624)|
| 1:00:28| I think it would be easier for the community to welcome another structure into their neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=3628)|
| 1:00:34| if they see that the facility works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=3634)|
| 1:00:36| And I think the main concern that I hear in the public is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=3636)|
| 1:00:40| we don't know that they're going to work because the way we've always dealt with homeless is just crowd them in one spot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=3640)|
| 1:00:45| feed them, and give them what they need, and not provide services that helps them to succeed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=3645)|
| 1:00:52| And I understand this program does that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=3652)|
| 1:00:54| But why can't we have a small pilot program to do that instead of going into neighborhoods that are already established| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=3654)|
| 1:01:03| and not knowing what they're getting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=3663)|
| 1:01:06| Two answers to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=3666)|
| 1:01:12| I think you've got to remember two things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=3672)|
| 1:01:14| Number one, Volunteer Ministry Center has been operating these 16 units for quite a few years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=3674)|
| 1:01:20| and their retention rate is slightly above the national average.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=3680)|
| 1:01:24| And at the same time, they've been successful placing over 144 individuals in the Permits Board of Housing over the past two years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=3684)|
| 1:01:31| And again, their retention rate is very high.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=3691)|
| 1:01:33| So I don't think it's just on a national level this has been proven, but on a local level it's been proven.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=3693)|
| 1:01:39| So I would argue that we are doing it, it is working,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=3699)|
| 1:01:43| and we know that it's more apt to work in a more effective way if the developments we do offer a Volunteer Ministry Center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=3703)|
| 1:01:52| whoever's providing the supportive services, the opportunity to do that in greater numbers in one building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=3712)|
| 1:02:00| to increase the efficiencies both in operating costs, but also efficiencies as far as service provision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=3720)|
| 1:02:06| If they're in KCDC, let's just say we use one floor of God Be Loved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=3726)|
| 1:02:13| That would be great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=3733)|
| 1:02:15| That's already been paid for by KCDC Housing, if they're in KCDC Housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=3735)|
| 1:02:20| So Volunteer Ministries does not have to, they've got more money to work with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=3740)|
| 1:02:27| I understand what you're saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=3747)|
| 1:02:29| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=3749)|
| 1:02:30| But I think there's a more effective and efficient way to do it without spending $6 or $7 million on a $50,000 building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=3750)|
| 1:02:37| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=3757)|
| 1:02:38| And I do think several things that I've learned from Tim's presentation, this master leasing concept,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=3758)|
| 1:02:44| that's something that we hadn't paid, we've kind of thought about it, but we haven't paid a lot of attention to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=3764)|
| 1:02:49| and it's something we ought to give a lot more attention to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=3769)|
| 1:02:51| because it would speed up our process and our effectiveness quite a bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=3771)|
| 1:02:56| And then your idea is also very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=3776)|
| 1:02:58| We have placed case managers at God Be Loved and several other KCDC properties to help stabilize those properties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=3778)|
| 1:03:05| but we are very open to working with Alvin and his staff to find a suitable apartment complex| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=3785)|
| 1:03:12| that has a subsidy attached to it and working on a floor-by-floor basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=3792)|
| 1:03:16| That's a very good idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=3796)|
| 1:03:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=3799)|
| 1:03:20| I've got anything else, Commissioner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=3800)|
| 1:03:21| I've got about five folk who want to be heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=3801)|
| 1:03:23| I'm going in the order in which I wrote them down as I saw them raise their hands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=3803)|
| 1:03:28| Commissioner McKenzie, then there will be Commissioner Brown, then Councilman Pelo, Commissioner Harmon,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=3808)|
| 1:03:34| and then Councilman Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=3814)|
| 1:03:35| So, Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=3815)|
| 1:03:38| Thank you, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=3818)|
| 1:03:40| I guess this question is a little similar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=3820)|
| 1:03:44| It's probably for John.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=3824)|
| 1:03:48| In terms of dealing with KCDC, have we, in terms of economic impact and value to property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=3828)|
| 1:03:59| have we considered or are we considering existing, lack of a better term,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=3839)|
| 1:04:07| housing authority owned facilities or clustering of private Section 8 type areas in terms of neighborhood?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=3847)|
| 1:04:18| So, my basic question, are we going to create areas that are already probably fairly taxed as it relates to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=3858)|
| 1:04:30| affordable housing or are we going to look at those to try to locate them there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=3870)|
| 1:04:37| Because I know Tim kind of discussed that a little in his presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=3877)|
| 1:04:43| If I understand your question correctly, what I hear you asking me is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=3883)|
| 1:04:47| are we going to use the existing housing stock as part of the units that we use to site| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=3887)|
| 1:04:56| or not site but place?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=3896)|
| 1:04:59| Are we going to use it as a criterion in either for or against?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=3899)|
| 1:05:03| So, are we going to use that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=3903)|
| 1:05:04| Are we going to look at those?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=3904)|
| 1:05:06| Are we going to put dots on a map and say either we'll locate them there or we won't based on whatever criterion you use?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=3906)|
| 1:05:11| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=3911)|
| 1:05:12| Remember, one of Tim's citing considerations was existence of current affordable housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=3912)|
| 1:05:19| I think we've got to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=3919)|
| 1:05:21| You were the one that said, do we have a map with the dots that show what is already there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=3921)|
| 1:05:25| That was a great idea and something that I know David Massey has talked with us in our department about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=3925)|
| 1:05:31| Let's put together that map as we go through this task force.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=3931)|
| 1:05:34| Let's know what's already there because we can't reasonably talk about how do we work with these operating definitions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=3934)|
| 1:05:41| unless we know our starting point, which is what is already there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=3941)|
| 1:05:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=3946)|
| 1:05:47| So, that's something that's coming, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=3947)|
| 1:05:49| That will be a part of the work of this task force, definitely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=3949)|
| 1:05:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=3952)|
| 1:05:53| I guess my next couple for Tim, they're real quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=3953)|
| 1:05:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=3955)|
| 1:05:56| You had the slide where you talked about the cost savings in Denver and you talked about a couple of others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=3956)|
| 1:06:07| I guess on your initial slide, you also talked about a decrease in emergency shelters and transitional shelters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=3967)|
| 1:06:17| Are those actual dollars saved?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=3977)|
| 1:06:19| Are we decreasing bed space at, say, traditional volunteer ministry facility or Salvation Army facilities?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=3979)|
| 1:06:28| Are these really dollars saved?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=3988)|
| 1:06:33| Specifically on the Denver slide, those are gross dollars saved to those systems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=3993)|
| 1:06:39| So, they're very real savings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=3999)|
| 1:06:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=4002)|
| 1:06:43| In other words, in terms of it took us $5 million to pay for the health care and emergency room, 2006, 2007 is down to $2 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=4003)|
| 1:06:52| Is that what you're saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=4012)|
| 1:06:53| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=4013)|
| 1:06:54| So, for example, in detox, 24 months prior to going into housing, one individual utilized or cost that public system $10,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=4014)|
| 1:07:05| 24 months post-supportive housing, they cost that system $1,600.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=4025)|
| 1:07:12| So, that's a very real savings of that individual to that one system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=4032)|
| 1:07:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=4036)|
| 1:07:17| So, in tracking that out for years, it sounds like you all have been at this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=4037)|
| 1:07:21| Have those successful sustainable affordable housing models, have they reduced the number of beds and the traditional shelters?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=4041)|
| 1:07:34| Yes, they have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=4054)|
| 1:07:35| Most communities, because this is really the way the federal government is moving it in the Department of Housing and Urban Development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=4055)|
| 1:07:42| it would be almost impossible for you to federally finance a shelter today because the federal government is moving away from emergency shelter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=4062)|
| 1:07:49| and more toward the housing first model and supportive housing specifically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=4069)|
| 1:07:53| So, the number of emergency shelter beds in a community should be going down as the number of supportive housing units goes up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=4073)|
| 1:08:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=4083)|
| 1:08:04| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=4084)|
| 1:08:05| And again, as I mentioned early on, there will always be households in crisis who may need a place to sleep tonight because they lost their housing at noon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=4085)|
| 1:08:12| So, there will be, you know, you will have a need for those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=4092)|
| 1:08:15| But the idea is that it's fewer beds and they need them for shorter periods of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=4095)|
| 1:08:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=4099)|
| 1:08:20| And my last question is it sounds like you're kind of familiar with the whole Fair Housing Act and how it relates to siting in these facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=4100)|
| 1:08:29| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=4109)|
| 1:08:30| Are there any provisions in that act that talk about public funding of a site?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=4110)|
| 1:08:36| I understand the zoning and trying to zone them in or zone them out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=4116)|
| 1:08:39| But are there any statutes or amendments to that act that deal directly with you did not give taxpayer dollars to Project A,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=4119)|
| 1:08:51| and that's a violation of the Fair Housing Act?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=4131)|
| 1:08:57| Well, far be it for me to give the Councilor a commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=4137)|
| 1:09:01| No, yeah, I'm just asking your history.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=4141)|
| 1:09:03| I would suggest to you that it's not necessarily the action that is governed by the Fair Housing Act.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=4143)|
| 1:09:12| It's the basis of the decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=4152)|
| 1:09:15| How's that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=4155)|
| 1:09:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=4158)|
| 1:09:19| So I guess that's my way of saying to you, if you decided not to give a supportive housing development city money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=4159)|
| 1:09:28| based solely because of who's going to be living in it, I would caution you because of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=4168)|
| 1:09:35| because those are generally protected populations under the Federal Fair Housing Act.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=4175)|
| 1:09:40| And if that was the sole basis for not giving a development funding, I think you could be challenged.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=4180)|
| 1:09:48| Does that respond to your question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=4188)|
| 1:09:55| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=4195)|
| 1:09:57| Yes, Ms. Weatherstone, if you would, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=4197)|
| 1:10:02| You say you're operating one unit now with 16?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=4202)|
| 1:10:06| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=4206)|
| 1:10:07| Do you have an on-site case manager there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=4207)|
| 1:10:10| We have case managers who are located within the same building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=4210)|
| 1:10:15| Do you have an apartment manager who is there over the nighttime hours?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=4215)|
| 1:10:21| Well, in the proposals that have been given in the meetings that I've been to so far,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=4221)|
| 1:10:26| we were told that there would be an on-site case manager on duty there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=4226)|
| 1:10:32| possibly an off-duty police person for the nighttime.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=4232)|
| 1:10:39| How well do you track these folks through the program?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=4239)|
| 1:10:44| I mean, can we get some kind of statistics on what has been done locally?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=4244)|
| 1:10:49| I mean, we can look at New York and Chicago, but this ain't New York and Chicago and San Francisco.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=4249)|
| 1:10:53| This is Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=4253)|
| 1:10:54| Sure, sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=4254)|
| 1:10:55| So we need to see what has been done, what kind of success you have with what you've had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=4255)|
| 1:11:04| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=4264)|
| 1:11:05| You mentioned a while ago the dots on the map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=4265)|
| 1:11:09| I ask MPC for a list of those because I don't think we can determine anything until we know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=4269)|
| 1:11:15| I mean, there's another person sitting up here at this table that knows where they're all at right now, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=4275)|
| 1:11:20| Until we can find out where they're at, we can't decide where we think they need to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=4280)|
| 1:11:26| What percentage of the folks through your program wind up as, well, back in the criminal system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=4286)|
| 1:11:34| for want of a better word?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=4294)|
| 1:11:37| Let me tell you this, because I did not bring all of that information with me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=4297)|
| 1:11:42| but I can tell you the 16 apartments that are the Jackson apartments during the last year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=4302)|
| 1:11:48| there have been 16 gentlemen there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=4308)|
| 1:11:51| Two have moved out and into what we would consider a better situation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=4311)|
| 1:11:57| reconciliation with family, out to a better apartment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=4317)|
| 1:12:01| Two have left under less positive circumstances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=4321)|
| 1:12:06| The others remain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=4326)|
| 1:12:08| So I'm sorry, I can't do that math in my head, but I can tell you that in a year's period of time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=4328)|
| 1:12:14| that's what that one apartment complex has produced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=4334)|
| 1:12:18| That's what those numbers would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=4338)|
| 1:12:23| From January 1 of this year until November 30, we had placed, I believe, we're at 66 individuals now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=4343)|
| 1:12:37| and I think it was something like 61, 62 individuals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=4357)|
| 1:12:41| and our retention rate for those folks still remaining in housing is at 91 percent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=4361)|
| 1:12:47| as I stand here and talk to you now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=4367)|
| 1:12:49| Last year, which we consider to be our first year doing this kind of work, the first full year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=4369)|
| 1:12:57| the retention rate was 74 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=4377)|
| 1:13:01| That is lower than we wanted it to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=4381)|
| 1:13:05| I think we were still learning and still getting the case management,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=4385)|
| 1:13:08| still figuring out exactly how to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=4388)|
| 1:13:11| So basically two out of 16 went back into the criminal system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=4391)|
| 1:13:14| Two out of 16, and I would not say went back into the criminal system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=4394)|
| 1:13:18| I could not tell you that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=4398)|
| 1:13:20| I would tell you that we don't necessarily know exactly where they went.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=4400)|
| 1:13:25| I could not tell you with any assurance that they are criminals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=4405)|
| 1:13:29| The reason I'm asking that question is that last night's meeting in this room,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=4409)|
| 1:13:33| the figure was given somewhere over 50 percent nationwide went back into the criminal system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=4413)|
| 1:13:38| and I think that's an awful high number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=4418)|
| 1:13:44| Just to clarify that figure, what I said was that in urban areas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=4424)|
| 1:13:50| 50 percent of the street homeless are parolees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=4430)|
| 1:13:54| So I did not mean that to imply that they went back into the correctional system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=4434)|
| 1:14:01| It's that 50 percent of the street homeless came out of the correctional system at some point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=4441)|
| 1:14:07| Is anybody here from Helen Ross McNabb tonight?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=4447)|
| 1:14:10| Would you come forward, please, sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=4450)|
| 1:14:17| Do you all operate how many so far?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=4457)|
| 1:14:20| How many housing units?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=4460)|
| 1:14:21| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=4461)|
| 1:14:22| Thirty-two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=4462)|
| 1:14:23| Of this type?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=4463)|
| 1:14:26| Permanent supportive housing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=4466)|
| 1:14:27| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=4467)|
| 1:14:28| While you get your answer to that question, also give us your name for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=4468)|
| 1:14:31| All 32.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=4471)|
| 1:14:32| All 32 are, which is a total of how many individuals?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=4472)|
| 1:14:36| Thirty-two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=4476)|
| 1:14:41| Thirty-two houses and 32 people?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=4481)|
| 1:14:43| They're all in single-family housing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=4483)|
| 1:14:45| Thirty-two total units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=4485)|
| 1:14:46| Thirty-two total units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=4486)|
| 1:14:50| You know, what disturbs me most about this is you guys know that we've been starting to work on this problem,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=4490)|
| 1:14:56| yet in last week's paper it's announced that you buy three more lots in various areas of the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=4496)|
| 1:15:06| It's like you all are going to put this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=4506)|
| 1:15:08| I mean, you came to the meeting in South Knoxville over there about the one over there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=4508)|
| 1:15:12| and basically told the folks there that night, we're going to put it there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=4512)|
| 1:15:14| We don't care what you think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=4514)|
| 1:15:16| We've only purchased three properties total.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=4516)|
| 1:15:19| Well, I'm going with what was in the newspaper last weekend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=4519)|
| 1:15:22| We've only purchased three properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=4522)|
| 1:15:24| Well, the fact that you guys are going ahead without some direction from this group makes me want to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=4524)|
| 1:15:33| hey, hold off on all of it until we get something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=4533)|
| 1:15:37| I know you've got to buy a property when you can get it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=4537)|
| 1:15:39| But you're talking about putting these in areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=4539)|
| 1:15:44| Now, figures I've heard, we've got 127 in South Knoxville now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=4544)|
| 1:15:48| Look over at the Fifth Avenue area there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=4548)|
| 1:15:52| These things, if we're going to make it work, it needs to be spread about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=4552)|
| 1:15:57| and it's going to have to be done in the right way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=4557)|
| 1:15:59| And I think we should also have some say-so in that you mentioned the voluntary participation in some of these a while ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=4559)|
| 1:16:08| If these folks are going to be in this program, I think they need to go through the program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=4568)|
| 1:16:12| They need to abide by the rules, and otherwise they're out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=4572)|
| 1:16:20| So what is your take on why you keep jamming them down people's throat without asking?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=4580)|
| 1:16:29| We set forth a number of criteria for the properties we wanted to purchase,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=4589)|
| 1:16:34| and we based that on our 20 years' worth of experience in this type of housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=4594)|
| 1:16:38| and that's how we decided which properties to purchase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=4598)|
| 1:16:41| But do you not believe in working with neighborhoods?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=4601)|
| 1:16:44| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=4604)|
| 1:16:45| We work very well with the neighborhoods we're in now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=4605)|
| 1:16:47| You sure haven't in the south end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=4607)|
| 1:16:49| I'll tell you that right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=4609)|
| 1:16:50| We don't have any housing in the area we purchased properties in South Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=4610)|
| 1:16:54| You just bought property over there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=4614)|
| 1:16:55| You came to a meeting last month over there and told the folks over there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=4615)|
| 1:16:58| you're going to put it there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=4618)|
| 1:16:59| You didn't care what they thought, basically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=4619)|
| 1:17:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=4625)|
| 1:17:07| Next, and before you step away, sir, I need your name for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=4627)|
| 1:17:10| Houston Smeltzer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=4630)|
| 1:17:11| Okay, and what's your position with Helen Ross?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=4631)|
| 1:17:14| I'm with the Development Office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=4634)|
| 1:17:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=4635)|
| 1:17:16| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=4636)|
| 1:17:17| Council Member Pelo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=4637)|
| 1:17:18| And also, as we begin, everybody has busy schedules,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=4638)|
| 1:17:20| and after Council Member Pelo, I'd like to ask John a question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=4640)|
| 1:17:24| because I want to get back to one of the points he made about this task force,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=4644)|
| 1:17:29| because I have a couple of questions, and I want to hone us in on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=4649)|
| 1:17:32| And a couple of things I think that the task force needs to consider,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=4652)|
| 1:17:35| and hopefully someone is taking notes here with John's office about some of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=4655)|
| 1:17:39| these concerns, because those are very valid points that need to be considered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=4659)|
| 1:17:42| in that process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=4662)|
| 1:17:43| Council Member Pelo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=4663)|
| 1:17:44| Well, this question belongs so far back in the discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=4664)|
| 1:17:48| It probably seems strange now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=4668)|
| 1:17:50| But, Jenny Weatherstone, if you would come up just a moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=4670)|
| 1:17:54| You know, I think there probably is a lot of concern about this being voluntary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=4674)|
| 1:18:01| because, and I guess that caught me a little bit by surprise,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=4681)|
| 1:18:06| even though I've had quite a relationship with the program at BMC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=4686)|
| 1:18:14| I think a lot of the concern is in regard to the fact that the numbers show that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=4694)|
| 1:18:21| so much of this is due to mental illness, serious mental illness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=4701)|
| 1:18:26| And then, of course, we have the drug issue and so on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=4706)|
| 1:18:32| So explain to me how when one of these facilities is situated in a residential area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=4712)|
| 1:18:42| close to a residential area, how the voluntary works with people who are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=4722)|
| 1:18:48| seriously needing to have regular medication.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=4728)|
| 1:18:51| I understand how it works with the 16 units there at the Corner of Jackson and Gay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=4731)|
| 1:18:58| And I understand your supervision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=4738)|
| 1:19:01| But now I need to feel a little bit more comfortable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=4741)|
| 1:19:04| and I think some of the other folks have expressed that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=4744)|
| 1:19:08| with the voluntary aspect of it when people are going to be located in neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=4748)|
| 1:19:16| Let me use as an example, I guess, some folks who have been seriously mentally ill| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=4756)|
| 1:19:23| that we have placed in sites that are not the Jackson Avenue apartments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=4763)|
| 1:19:27| And the case managers do all manner of things in order to get that person stabilized| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=4767)|
| 1:19:36| once they are in the hospital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=4776)|
| 1:19:38| And it may start with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=4778)|
| 1:19:40| I'll pick you up tomorrow to take you to your mental health appointment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=4780)|
| 1:19:44| And then they pick them up tomorrow to take them to the mental health appointment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=4784)|
| 1:19:47| As time goes on, it can be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=4787)|
| 1:19:49| tomorrow we're going to ride the bus to your mental health appointment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=4789)|
| 1:19:53| And they begin the bus training process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=4793)|
| 1:19:56| Then we begin to track if that person is making their appointments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=4796)|
| 1:20:01| And what we are finding is that they are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=4801)|
| 1:20:05| Again, the voluntary thing is almost difficult for me to answer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=4805)|
| 1:20:10| because our level of compliance, I guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=4810)|
| 1:20:14| or our level of cooperation with the case management is so high| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=4814)|
| 1:20:18| because that relationship is intact before the move-in begins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=4818)|
| 1:20:23| So there are some requirements before people qualify for consideration for housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=4823)|
| 1:20:34| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=4834)|
| 1:20:35| And I don't believe that has been commented on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=4835)|
| 1:20:37| Here are some examples.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=4837)|
| 1:20:40| Number one, the person is responsible for rent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=4840)|
| 1:20:43| There has to be a source of income.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=4843)|
| 1:20:45| So it may be that one of the first things that we need to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=4845)|
| 1:20:49| is help that individual find that source of income,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=4849)|
| 1:20:53| whether it is disability, whether it's beginning to talk about a job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=4853)|
| 1:20:58| There have been some instances when we have felt extremely strongly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=4858)|
| 1:21:02| that we needed to get that person in housing as quickly as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=4862)|
| 1:21:06| They did not have an income.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=4866)|
| 1:21:08| We felt that they would qualify for disability,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=4868)|
| 1:21:10| but that was going to take a little time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=4870)|
| 1:21:12| We were able to work with a church group to pick up the rent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=4872)|
| 1:21:16| But even doing that takes time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=4876)|
| 1:21:18| and that's valuable time that you use to build the relationship.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=4878)|
| 1:21:22| So that once the person gets in housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=4882)|
| 1:21:25| then we've got to work on the income now so that you can stay here, that kind of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=4885)|
| 1:21:30| And I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=4890)|
| 1:21:31| But I think a great deal of my interest and concern about this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=4891)|
| 1:21:36| involves people who are not capable of being accountable for their medications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=4896)|
| 1:21:42| You know, there's always the aspect of someone having the medication,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=4902)|
| 1:21:46| selling it or trading it or losing it or forgetting it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=4906)|
| 1:21:51| Or it's stolen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=4911)|
| 1:21:52| And it certainly makes a difference in how accountable they can be for the rent for others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=4912)|
| 1:21:58| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=4918)|
| 1:21:59| And their behavior matters, which will allow them to stay in the house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=4919)|
| 1:22:04| Absolutely right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=4924)|
| 1:22:05| So speak to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=4925)|
| 1:22:06| Well, there's two things that we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=4926)|
| 1:22:09| So many of the folks that we have placed, our case managers have gotten the pill box| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=4929)|
| 1:22:14| and will help that individual dose out the pills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=4934)|
| 1:22:17| However, we have placed individuals who have not been capable of even that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=4937)|
| 1:22:23| And we have worked hard with their mental health provider to get them on an injectable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=4943)|
| 1:22:28| so that we will make sure that they get their shot once a month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=4948)|
| 1:22:31| And that has been truly remarkable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=4951)|
| 1:22:35| That has helped immensely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=4955)|
| 1:22:38| And have you found that the success when that kind of intervention occurs is much better?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=4958)|
| 1:22:45| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=4965)|
| 1:22:46| And I don't want to present to anyone here that we are saying that permanent supportive housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=4966)|
| 1:22:53| will succeed 100% all the time because it won't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=4973)|
| 1:22:58| But what I do want to suggest is that it will be successful, well-operated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=4978)|
| 1:23:04| It will be successful 80% to 85% of the time, which is certainly a heck of a lot better| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=4984)|
| 1:23:10| than where we are now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=4990)|
| 1:23:12| And that we can get better all the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=4992)|
| 1:23:15| But there are things to figure out about each individual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=4995)|
| 1:23:20| This individual needs an injectable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=5000)|
| 1:23:22| We can do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=5002)|
| 1:23:23| We can do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=5003)|
| 1:23:25| The problem is that if that person is not compliant and won't do it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=5005)|
| 1:23:29| then what you're going to see is failure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=5009)|
| 1:23:32| And you're going to see violations of the lease.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=5012)|
| 1:23:34| And that person is held accountable to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=5014)|
| 1:23:37| The other thing is that if that becomes a danger, that by itself can get their attention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=5017)|
| 1:23:45| They like having an apartment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=5025)|
| 1:23:48| And the thought of losing an apartment has some power to help them realize| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=5028)|
| 1:23:52| that behavior needs to change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=5032)|
| 1:23:55| Commissioner Harmon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=5035)|
| 1:23:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=5037)|
| 1:24:00| I noticed the law director in the back of the room,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=5040)|
| 1:24:02| and I wanted to remind him that he's pledged wording as an alternative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=5042)|
| 1:24:07| to the radius amendment by this meeting, and I haven't received it yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=5047)|
| 1:24:11| So I'm hoping to be in receipt of it perhaps by tomorrow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=5051)|
| 1:24:14| so I can put it on the commission form so we all can look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=5054)|
| 1:24:18| Can you do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=5058)|
| 1:24:21| If you can, quickly, I just like the wording.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=5061)|
| 1:24:24| Please come to the mic, please, and give us your name, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=5064)|
| 1:24:36| My name is Bill Lockett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=5076)|
| 1:24:37| I'm the Knox County Law Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=5077)|
| 1:24:39| And as I did pledge to Commissioner Harmon to work with fair housing federal folks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=5079)|
| 1:24:48| their in-house legal counsel, to collaborate to come up with some substitute language| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=5088)|
| 1:24:56| that would pass legal muster in place of the amendment that had been offered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=5096)|
| 1:25:04| to the resolution that came before the Knox County Commission previously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=5104)|
| 1:25:09| And I have been in contact with those folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=5109)|
| 1:25:12| Unfortunately, their local counsel has retired and is no longer available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=5112)|
| 1:25:21| I have spoken to Mr. Derryberry, who is counsel with HUD in Nashville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=5121)|
| 1:25:27| and he has referred me to counsel in Washington.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=5127)|
| 1:25:32| And on this particular issue, my intent in collaborating with them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=5132)|
| 1:25:40| on this discreet issue of this entire discussion, a lot of subjects have been covered tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=5140)|
| 1:25:47| but as to what Commissioner Harmon is alluding to was one legal issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=5147)|
| 1:25:55| and that is a radius requirement that was part of the amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=5155)|
| 1:26:02| And there's been a lot of litigation across the country on similar issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=5162)|
| 1:26:10| And as the Law Director for Knox County, I view it as my goal to insulate Knox County from potential liability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=5170)|
| 1:26:19| And that's why I thought it would be advisable to work with one of the agencies whose job is to refer litigation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=5179)|
| 1:26:28| Oh, I appreciate that, and I appreciate being in the same position I am,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=5188)|
| 1:26:32| which is sometimes not having phone calls returned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=5192)|
| 1:26:36| You had not asked me to return a phone call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=5196)|
| 1:26:38| You left me a voicemail message today but did not ask for a return phone call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=5198)|
| 1:26:43| I listened to your message.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=5203)|
| 1:26:45| It was Monday, but that's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=5205)|
| 1:26:47| I understand when people don't return calls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=5207)|
| 1:26:49| I understand it's difficult to get through to federal officials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=5209)|
| 1:26:51| What I want to suggest to you is an alternate method.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=5211)|
| 1:26:54| Mr. Klont is here, Tim Klont.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=5214)|
| 1:26:57| And he mentioned last night something called fair share provisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=5217)|
| 1:27:02| And I found at least four communities, Tempe, San Diego, Los Angeles, and Berkeley,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=5222)|
| 1:27:07| that crafted legislation, which apparently has had no challenge, no problem,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=5227)|
| 1:27:12| about sharing the burden around communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=5232)|
| 1:27:16| What I'm going to ask you is to talk to him and find out what you can about these fair share methods,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=5236)|
| 1:27:22| and that may be a way around the roadblock that you and I both have encountered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=5242)|
| 1:27:26| I'll be happy to do that, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=5246)|
| 1:27:28| Well, thank you, because I think that will help everyone involved with this legal question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=5248)|
| 1:27:32| And, Mr. Klont, you may not know that much about fair share, but you mentioned it last night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=5252)|
| 1:27:36| Actually, it's funny that you referenced Tempe because I'm their former city planner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=5256)|
| 1:27:42| So you can give them a lot of information on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=5262)|
| 1:27:44| With the fair share reference, at least in Tempe, is that Tempe is an inner ring suburb of the city of Phoenix,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=5264)|
| 1:27:54| so a whole host of suburbs around there, and the cities came together around homeless issues specifically,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=5274)|
| 1:27:58| and they said that not everything can be inside of the city of Phoenix.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=5278)|
| 1:28:01| So communities come forward and start staking your fair share.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=5281)|
| 1:28:05| So it wasn't the basis is not exclusion through zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=5285)|
| 1:28:11| It was communities coming forward and saying, we acknowledge that homelessness is an issue in the region,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=5291)|
| 1:28:17| and we are willing to do our fair share to address the homelessness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=5297)|
| 1:28:21| So that was just the Tempe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=5301)|
| 1:28:23| Yeah, and I'm sure the others have very similar models,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=5303)|
| 1:28:25| and I'm wondering if we can benefit from that to achieve the objectives of spreading it around the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=5305)|
| 1:28:30| Certainly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=5310)|
| 1:28:31| The other thing I wanted to suggest to you is you said that persons in permanent supportive housing can be evicted for violation of a lease,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=5311)|
| 1:28:38| which is, in effect, a contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=5318)|
| 1:28:40| So apparently the law on this is that zoning can get you in trouble when it comes to homeless in the Fair Housing Act,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=5320)|
| 1:28:46| but enforcement of a contract is not a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=5326)|
| 1:28:49| Well, the zoning says forward the terms and conditions of tenancy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=5329)|
| 1:28:54| It's a lease probably unlike one that you or I would sign to rent an apartment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=5334)|
| 1:29:01| So, you know, for example, in supportive housing, let's say that you're drinking and drugging, okay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=5341)|
| 1:29:08| to the point to where you're destroying your unit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=5348)|
| 1:29:11| Your provider could evict you, not because you used and not because you didn't participate in services,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=5351)|
| 1:29:16| but because the behavior that resulted from not doing that violated your lease.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=5356)|
| 1:29:21| So enforcement of a contract is less of a problem than a zoning ordinance, for example?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=5361)|
| 1:29:27| I – no, I mean enforcement of a lease contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=5367)|
| 1:29:31| There's no problem at all, really?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=5371)|
| 1:29:33| No, it's a legal contract, correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=5373)|
| 1:29:35| Great. Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=5375)|
| 1:29:38| Councilman Becker, I believe you're next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=5378)|
| 1:29:40| Did you want to ask a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=5380)|
| 1:29:41| Yeah, I did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=5381)|
| 1:29:42| Hey, John, before we lose too many other people, I need to get an idea for the commission and for council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=5382)|
| 1:29:48| Your suggestion earlier with regards to a task force, could you enlighten us as to, number one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=5388)|
| 1:29:54| how many members are you soliciting from commission and from council?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=5394)|
| 1:30:00| Number two, what would be your timeline with regards to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=5400)|
| 1:30:06| And then number three, there are several pointers I've been writing down that I would hope that if this council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=5406)|
| 1:30:13| and commission agrees to put someone in that process that some of these issues will be considered in that process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=5413)|
| 1:30:20| because they're all part and parcel of this concern with regards to siting considerations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=5420)|
| 1:30:25| So let me know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=5425)|
| 1:30:26| I need time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=5426)|
| 1:30:27| I need how many folk you're thinking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=5427)|
| 1:30:29| And then also maybe a little bit about the scope of what's going to be considered by this commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=5429)|
| 1:30:34| and what's going to be the out product for these two bodies to consider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=5434)|
| 1:30:38| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=5438)|
| 1:30:39| That's great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=5439)|
| 1:30:40| All good questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=5440)|
| 1:30:41| First of all, I would like to see at least, I know you're all very busy, two members of council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=5441)|
| 1:30:46| and three members of commission on the task force.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=5446)|
| 1:30:49| If you decided one and two, that's fine with me because I understand you are busy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=5449)|
| 1:30:54| The charge to the task force, the thing that would be most helpful to us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=5454)|
| 1:30:58| and I think that would serve the interest of all the stakeholders the best, is to look at siting considerations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=5458)|
| 1:31:05| those that Tim looked at, and we could also say are there others we need to consider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=5465)|
| 1:31:09| And given the interest of all the parties at the table, let's work up working definitions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=5469)|
| 1:31:17| for all those siting considerations that best serve all the interests at the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=5477)|
| 1:31:23| And my hunch is it's going to serve us well to have a facilitator of that conversation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=5483)|
| 1:31:28| because the interest from each of the stakeholder groups is probably pretty different in a lot of different cases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=5488)|
| 1:31:35| So we would try to find a facilitator that is neutral that could help us with those conversations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=5495)|
| 1:31:40| But the end product would be here are the siting considerations that we all agree are critical| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=5500)|
| 1:31:47| when we're thinking about the development of permanent supportive housing throughout Knoxville, Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=5507)|
| 1:31:53| Secondly, here are the operating definitions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=5513)|
| 1:31:56| I mean, this is how these things play out when developers begin to think about using these siting considerations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=5516)|
| 1:32:03| in the different communities throughout Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=5523)|
| 1:32:07| And I think three months if we could, and this month is kind of a wash,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=5527)|
| 1:32:12| but then if we jumped in January and February, by mid-March,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=5532)|
| 1:32:18| we ought to have something great to be able to bring back to both bodies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=5538)|
| 1:32:22| Yeah, let me ask this with regards to things that the committee is going to consider| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=5542)|
| 1:32:27| besides some of the siting considerations that were given earlier by Mr. Klont.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=5547)|
| 1:32:32| I would like for the commission to also, the committee, task force, whatever you want to call it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=5552)|
| 1:32:38| to be thinking in terms of as they're dealing with siting considerations, the issue of fair share provisions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=5558)|
| 1:32:44| the issues of leasing and leases and how that could come into play.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=5564)|
| 1:32:49| The whole issue, as someone asked earlier, we do need a map of existing Section 8,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=5569)|
| 1:32:54| KC's D.C. development, infill developments, VM facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=5574)|
| 1:32:58| Affordable housing options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=5578)|
| 1:33:00| Where are they at currently, you know, the dots that Commissioner McKenzie spoke of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=5580)|
| 1:33:05| you know, including halfway houses and who operates them and Helen Ross McNabb locations, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=5585)|
| 1:33:11| There needs to be from this group, because at this group, at this table,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=5591)|
| 1:33:15| I would hope you would not only have commission, city council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=5595)|
| 1:33:18| but we're going to have affected neighborhoods and neighborhood advocates there at the table also,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=5598)|
| 1:33:23| as well as those other interested parties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=5603)|
| 1:33:26| But there needs to be some discussion in that about how these siting considerations are going to dovetail| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=5606)|
| 1:33:31| with interfacing with those communities if we get that far with the placing of these housings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=5611)|
| 1:33:35| assimilating these facilities into communities, and also, quite frankly, just geographic district diversity, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=5615)|
| 1:33:43| And the other thing I would like to make sure that they're very concerned about is or very cognizant of is this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=5623)|
| 1:33:50| When I look at some of these siting considerations here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=5630)|
| 1:33:53| several of them indicate six district downtown right around KC D.C. housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=5633)|
| 1:33:59| And also indicate to me South Knoxville, Vestal, places of that nature,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=5639)|
| 1:34:05| some places that Commissioner Brown is concerned about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=5645)|
| 1:34:08| Several of these definitions say Beaumont, Lonsdale, Mechanicsville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=5648)|
| 1:34:12| when you start dealing with issues of service providers, transportation options, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=5652)|
| 1:34:16| So hopefully we'll think outside the box besides not coming back with some siting considerations that definitionally put them right back in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=5656)|
| 1:34:26| and clump them right back in where we already have large clumps of existing Section 8 housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=5666)|
| 1:34:31| or low-income neighborhoods that we're trying to bring back or also in areas where we have KC D.C. housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=5671)|
| 1:34:38| I think Commissioner Anders' suggestion about a pilot project was a good idea,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=5678)|
| 1:34:43| but one thing that I hesitate with regards to that is if you're going to try them right where you have existing Section 8 housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=5683)|
| 1:34:49| or existing KC D.C. facilities, that doesn't give us the right test that we need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=5689)|
| 1:34:54| The test needs to be one of how is it going to fit out in a neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=5694)|
| 1:34:58| and not within an already structured KC D.C. development and how do people respond there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=5698)|
| 1:35:04| So ultimately you've got to have that kind of pilot test also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=5704)|
| 1:35:08| So I guess what I'm saying is we don't need to come back with the bullet points we got here right now on siting considerations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=5708)|
| 1:35:15| because to me they narrow us immediately, you know, with regards to where we're going to put these things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=5715)|
| 1:35:20| And I am concerned, as I've said all along, that if you look at what's out there currently,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=5720)|
| 1:35:25| a large portion of it's already in my district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=5725)|
| 1:35:28| Menville is in my district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=5728)|
| 1:35:30| I know there's some consideration out on the southern end where we have Councilman Hall,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=5730)|
| 1:35:35| Councilman Pelo and myself down in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=5735)|
| 1:35:38| And then when you start talking about where KC D.C. housing is or where we have transportation, the K-Trans,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=5738)|
| 1:35:43| all those things indicate Councilman Becker's district, my district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=5743)|
| 1:35:47| Councilman Holquist's district, and Councilman Brown's district, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=5747)|
| 1:35:51| which doesn't share I think what could be a very positive experience for communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=5751)|
| 1:35:58| It doesn't spread that opportunity around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=5758)|
| 1:36:00| We won't say burden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=5760)|
| 1:36:01| It doesn't spread the opportunity around for the very positive experience of this type of housing to be spread around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=5761)|
| 1:36:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=5766)|
| 1:36:07| And now Councilman Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=5767)|
| 1:36:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=5770)|
| 1:36:11| I guess first I just want to follow up on something Commissioner Brown said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=5771)|
| 1:36:15| While we're doing this task force, we need to make sure we're not citing more facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=5775)|
| 1:36:19| So I think we need a moratorium on citing until this task force reports.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=5779)|
| 1:36:24| And I guess I want to, Mr. Lowell is already getting up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=5784)|
| 1:36:27| I was going to ask him to comment, but, you know, Mr. Swanson,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=5787)|
| 1:36:31| could you look into that and maybe draft up something on a moratorium?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=5791)|
| 1:36:34| And I know there's some legal challenges with that, but could you look into that for me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=5794)|
| 1:36:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=5801)|
| 1:36:44| Do you want to address that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=5804)|
| 1:36:46| I would like to say, as you all know, we haven't been sitting on our hands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=5806)|
| 1:36:50| So, you know, there are a couple of sites we've been working on for a year or so,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=5810)|
| 1:36:55| and we'd like to keep those on the table because we have applications into different funding entities right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=5815)|
| 1:37:00| pertaining to one site in particular.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=5820)|
| 1:37:03| So we'd like to keep that going because we think there's a good chance to be able to get some critical funding there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=5823)|
| 1:37:10| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=5830)|
| 1:37:11| But I think there's a worry with anybody, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=5831)|
| 1:37:13| when you talk about locating a site and then deciding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=5833)|
| 1:37:15| well, we really wouldn't want to put one there anyway because we've thought more on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=5835)|
| 1:37:20| So I'd worry about that, but we can work on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=5840)|
| 1:37:23| I've got two more questions for you, John.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=5843)|
| 1:37:26| One, we know we've got 16 units at Jackson Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=5846)|
| 1:37:32| What's it called?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=5852)|
| 1:37:33| Jackson Avenue, right above Voluntary Memory Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=5853)|
| 1:37:35| We've got those that are supportive housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=5855)|
| 1:37:37| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=5857)|
| 1:37:38| There are some 140 supportive housing units we've gotten across KCDC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=5858)|
| 1:37:44| There are over 140 individuals that are in current units that are receiving support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=5864)|
| 1:37:49| We saw some really interesting statistics here about incarcerations down in, you know, places.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=5869)|
| 1:37:55| Can we get some figures like that for what we're doing here in Knoxville?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=5875)|
| 1:37:59| Because we do have some experience with it now and ought to be able to look at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=5879)|
| 1:38:03| I was thinking as Tim was presenting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=5883)|
| 1:38:06| and thinking about Jenny's longevity of placing some of these folks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=5886)|
| 1:38:10| it would be very interesting to find an intern or somebody from UT to make that a project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=5890)|
| 1:38:16| to talk with those individuals, say what were your patterns prior to housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=5896)|
| 1:38:20| and then we have great data on what their patterns are since housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=5900)|
| 1:38:24| So we've got to find the right person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=5904)|
| 1:38:26| That would be a great project for someone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=5906)|
| 1:38:28| I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=5908)|
| 1:38:30| Last question I have for you is some of what I've heard last night and tonight from Mr. Klein| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=5910)|
| 1:38:36| is about how hard the service providers have to work to make this happen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=5916)|
| 1:38:40| that it's not a matter of you build a house and, you know, you hope they show up for therapy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=5920)|
| 1:38:45| but sort of the idea Mr. Klein talked about, going there every day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=5925)|
| 1:38:49| you know, knocking on that door twice a day until they answer it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=5929)|
| 1:38:52| And I'm wondering what your sense is, and Ms. Weatherstone can speak on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=5932)|
| 1:38:57| whether our service providers are willing to do that and able to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=5937)|
| 1:39:01| I tell you what, this has been a great job for me, but I've been impressed by two things in particular.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=5941)|
| 1:39:07| First of all, the leadership of the different homeless service providers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=5947)|
| 1:39:11| and how adaptive they've become to walk alongside what we're trying to accomplish| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=5951)|
| 1:39:16| at the same time being true to their mission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=5956)|
| 1:39:19| The second is the frontline people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=5959)|
| 1:39:21| I had Mayor Haslam, Mayor Ragsdale sit with some of those today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=5961)|
| 1:39:25| and I can't speak for them, but I will speak for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=5965)|
| 1:39:28| They were amazed at the commitment of these individuals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=5968)|
| 1:39:31| the collaborative spirit of these individuals, but the commitment is overwhelming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=5971)|
| 1:39:35| I mean, these folks love what they do, committed to what they're doing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=5975)|
| 1:39:40| and it's some of the hardest work any of us could ever do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=5980)|
| 1:39:43| So we've got great individuals committed to making this work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=5983)|
| 1:39:47| and there's no question in my mind of are the right people out there trying to make it happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=5987)|
| 1:39:51| You've got the right leadership, and you've got the right frontline people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=5991)|
| 1:39:55| I've got two other council members, actually, and then we're going to go to public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=5995)|
| 1:40:01| Council Member Woodhull, and then after that, Council Member Roddick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=6001)|
| 1:40:06| John, I heard you say Councilman Becker asked a couple of the questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=6006)|
| 1:40:15| that I wanted to have answered, so thank you for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=6015)|
| 1:40:19| So we have placed 20% of the chronically homeless people that we've identified into supportive residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=6019)|
| 1:40:27| That's what I heard you say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=6027)|
| 1:40:28| Not all of the 144 that have been placed are chronically homeless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=6028)|
| 1:40:32| Those 144 have gone into supportive housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=6032)|
| 1:40:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=6036)|
| 1:40:37| Some of those are episodically homeless, so they didn't meet the strict definition of chronically homeless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=6037)|
| 1:40:43| Okay, so how many of those 140 are not receiving support?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=6043)|
| 1:40:48| No, no, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=6048)|
| 1:40:49| My different point of differentiation was are they chronically homeless or episodically homeless?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=6049)|
| 1:40:54| They're all receiving support, but not all of them can be classified as chronically homeless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=6054)|
| 1:40:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=6059)|
| 1:41:00| Is that confusing to your face as it is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=6060)|
| 1:41:02| No, I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=6062)|
| 1:41:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=6063)|
| 1:41:04| The impression I was given at first was that this conversation was about the chronically homeless,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=6064)|
| 1:41:09| and 140 have been placed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=6069)|
| 1:41:11| That's how I understood the initial comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=6071)|
| 1:41:13| Okay, I'm sorry if that misled you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=6073)|
| 1:41:15| I was talking about the numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=6075)|
| 1:41:16| And then my next question would be, that's a big leap from 16.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=6076)|
| 1:41:22| How are we doing supporting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=6082)|
| 1:41:25| Well, that's the biggest challenge for an organization like Volunteer Ministry Center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=6085)|
| 1:41:30| that is in the midst of transforming itself to be a service provider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=6090)|
| 1:41:34| And what they've been able to do, some with our help,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=6094)|
| 1:41:37| but really based upon their successful track record,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=6097)|
| 1:41:40| is begin to hire new case managers to take on the load that continues to move towards them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=6100)|
| 1:41:48| comes through their front door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=6108)|
| 1:41:49| So they're doing great, but they're having to figure out how to fund their activity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=6109)|
| 1:41:56| and hire the right people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=6116)|
| 1:41:57| Great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=6117)|
| 1:41:58| Hey, thank you, John.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=6118)|
| 1:41:59| You're welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=6119)|
| 1:42:00| Tim, may I ask you a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=6120)|
| 1:42:02| Have you had enough time to read our plan, our overall plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=6122)|
| 1:42:06| I read the executive summary of your plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=6126)|
| 1:42:07| Do you have some comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=6127)|
| 1:42:08| Because there's more than just Housing First.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=6128)|
| 1:42:11| There is, right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=6131)|
| 1:42:12| It's one of about 350 plans to end homelessness around the country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=6132)|
| 1:42:17| So hats off to a community, especially if you're a size having a plan to end homelessness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=6137)|
| 1:42:23| I think it's wonderful that Housing First is really the cornerstone of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=6143)|
| 1:42:28| and specifically supportive housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=6148)|
| 1:42:30| I think the success of any plan is not only going to be addressing the homeless population as they exist today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=6150)|
| 1:42:39| but somehow creating your strategies to prevent homelessness from occurring in the first place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=6159)|
| 1:42:43| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=6163)|
| 1:42:44| So I would really encourage you, while I think it's important to focus a lot of time and energy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=6164)|
| 1:42:49| and money on housing those who are on the streets right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=6169)|
| 1:42:52| is that at some point when you catch your breath,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=6172)|
| 1:42:55| you start focusing your time and money and energy on the prevention side as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=6175)|
| 1:42:59| What kind of culture shift needs to take place in our community in order for us to be successful?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=6179)|
| 1:43:04| Well, I think that the organizational culture shift is starting to happen within your service provider community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=6184)|
| 1:43:12| because things are having to change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=6192)|
| 1:43:13| They're having to respond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=6193)|
| 1:43:15| The city is responding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=6195)|
| 1:43:17| That culture is changing, not only because of the directors from the federal government,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=6197)|
| 1:43:21| but because I think there's recognition that your current homeless system, in no offense, is just not working.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=6201)|
| 1:43:28| It's not ending the homelessness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=6208)|
| 1:43:30| It's managing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=6210)|
| 1:43:31| So I think that was a fundamental culture shift as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=6211)|
| 1:43:34| How did you determine that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=6214)|
| 1:43:35| Well, I mean, just by the fact that you write a plan to end homelessness| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=6215)|
| 1:43:40| and that the cornerstone of it is not emergency shelter or drop-in services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=6220)|
| 1:43:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=6224)|
| 1:43:45| Great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=6225)|
| 1:43:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=6226)|
| 1:43:47| You're welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=6227)|
| 1:43:48| Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=6228)|
| 1:43:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=6231)|
| 1:43:52| This question is for Mr. Klont as well, so I'm glad that you are up there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=6232)|
| 1:43:54| Could you possibly go back to slide 17?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=6234)|
| 1:43:57| And that's the slide with the bar graph that references the study in Denver, Colorado.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=6237)|
| 1:44:02| And this is a follow-up on Commissioner McKenzie's question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=6242)|
| 1:44:05| and I think it was something he was trying to get at and we didn't quite get there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=6245)|
| 1:44:09| But last night when I heard you speak, I heard some more specific information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=6249)|
| 1:44:15| Your graph shows the cost to the public system for 24 months pre-permanent supportive housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=6255)|
| 1:44:21| and then 24 months after.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=6261)|
| 1:44:22| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=6262)|
| 1:44:23| And you quoted that the gross savings per individual was $35,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=6263)|
| 1:44:27| I think what Commissioner McKenzie was trying to get at, and we talked about last night,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=6267)|
| 1:44:31| was what's the net savings per individual in a community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=6271)|
| 1:44:35| because you've got to net out obviously what it's costing you to provide all these support services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=6275)|
| 1:44:40| and the subsidized housing and that kind of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=6280)|
| 1:44:42| And it's still a savings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=6282)|
| 1:44:44| but I think that's what he was trying to get at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=6284)|
| 1:44:45| Okay, so let me give you the real numbers, and I'm sorry I didn't cover those tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=6285)|
| 1:44:48| and so I'm glad I did last night and you were listening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=6288)|
| 1:44:51| The average cost, gross cost, $31,575 per individual in that public system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=6291)|
| 1:44:59| So when you project it across the 150 chronically homeless individuals in the pilot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=6299)|
| 1:45:03| That $31,000 was after they were in permanent supportive housing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=6303)|
| 1:45:07| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=6307)|
| 1:45:08| That's the average cost savings per individual 24 months post.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=6308)|
| 1:45:12| Multiply it by the 150 individuals in the pilot, and it's a cost savings of $4.7 million gross.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=6312)|
| 1:45:19| Now when you factor in the cost of providing the housing and services,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=6319)|
| 1:45:23| it's a net savings of $4745, $4,745 per person,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=6323)|
| 1:45:29| which makes a net savings of the pilot $711,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=6329)|
| 1:45:34| And I think last night I even went one step beyond and said that if the City of Denver had the resources| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=6334)|
| 1:45:39| to be able to permanently and supportively house the 513 chronically homeless individuals that they identified,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=6339)|
| 1:45:46| it would have been a gross savings to their public systems of $16 million,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=6346)|
| 1:45:51| and a net savings of $2.4 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=6351)|
| 1:45:54| So there's still a savings, but obviously it drops substantially when you net out the cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=6354)|
| 1:45:58| The gross savings was, I believe, $35,000 per individual, and the net was $4745.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=6358)|
| 1:46:04| So you could assume from that that the cost of housing someone in Denver,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=6364)|
| 1:46:08| in support of both the housing and services, is roughly about $30,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=6368)|
| 1:46:12| $30,000, yeah. Very good. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=6372)|
| 1:46:14| You're welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=6374)|
| 1:46:15| Which, by the way, I'm glad that you mentioned it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=6375)|
| 1:46:17| So about $30,000, and again, let me remind you of the figure that Dr. Noe came up with in Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=6377)|
| 1:46:22| of $34,000 to your public system right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=6382)|
| 1:46:25| 37,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=6385)|
| 1:46:26| 37,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=6386)|
| 1:46:27| Councilman Bickus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=6387)|
| 1:46:28| I have a very quick follow-up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=6388)|
| 1:46:30| We're going to get to public form.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=6390)|
| 1:46:31| Ms. Rodney just pointed out that we know if we do supportive housing, even with the cost of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=6391)|
| 1:46:36| government is going to save money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=6396)|
| 1:46:38| One of the challenges is how do you get some of the savings into this, possibly this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=6398)|
| 1:46:41| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=6401)|
| 1:46:42| And I'm wondering if you have any advice on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=6402)|
| 1:46:44| Well, you know, I think going to the public, the more you engage these public systems,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=6404)|
| 1:46:50| your sheriffs, your hospitals, your psych wards, you know, your police departments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=6410)|
| 1:46:56| I think when you get them all around the table and you start talking about the issue of homelessness,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=6416)|
| 1:46:59| they're all going to have stories as well and they know that it all affects their bottom line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=6419)|
| 1:47:02| We're actually working on a really exciting project right now where the project sponsors a hospital| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=6422)|
| 1:47:08| because a hospital came to us and said we can no longer afford to be the primary caregiver to the homeless population| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=6428)|
| 1:47:14| and it's costing us, you know, X numbers of dollars,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=6434)|
| 1:47:17| and we know that if we redirected even a portion of that money into supportive housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=6437)|
| 1:47:22| that they're going to have better health outcomes and they're going to be more stably housed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=6442)|
| 1:47:26| So they're the lead on a project they're working on right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=6446)|
| 1:47:29| And it's all about somehow redirecting all or even a portion of those cost savings back into supportive housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=6449)|
| 1:47:37| But it's a system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=6457)|
| 1:47:38| You know, housing is a system that corrections probably doesn't really think much about or maybe the jail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=6458)|
| 1:47:43| I mean, you know, they're probably one of your biggest emergency shelter providers, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=6463)|
| 1:47:48| So, yes, just redirecting the resources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=6468)|
| 1:47:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=6471)|
| 1:47:52| And the record will reflect that by unanimous consent we've added public forum to our agenda tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=6472)|
| 1:47:59| We have a few people who have signed up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=6479)|

| 1:48:12| And council rules are you have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=6492)|
| 1:48:17| Give us your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=6497)|
| 1:48:19| And I'm going to have to use my phone here because I can't read that up there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=6499)|
| 1:48:23| Time is 644.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=6503)|
| 1:48:25| It's Catherine Miller, 4813 Costa Road, Knoxville, 37912.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=6505)|
| 1:48:32| Came here tonight mainly in the concern over the Costa Road location that Helen Ross McNabb had proposed a site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=6512)|
| 1:48:42| You are right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=6522)|
| 1:48:43| We were not asked and we were not told anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=6523)|
| 1:48:46| We were invited to a meet and greet meeting that was nothing but a here it is and we are shoving it down your throat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=6526)|
| 1:48:52| We asked many questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=6532)|
| 1:48:53| There were no answers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=6533)|
| 1:48:56| They could not give us any safety factor statistics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=6536)|
| 1:49:01| They would not even let us know where other locations were that they had either in progress or in working at the present time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=6541)|
| 1:49:12| They said that was a violation of their individuality.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=6552)|
| 1:49:21| But we are concerned and in skip, we have a, I have enclosed a letter that we received.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=6561)|
| 1:49:33| We only received two letters from Helen Ross McNabb for this project on the street of Costa.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=6573)|
| 1:49:39| If we had not talked to our neighbors, no one would have known about the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=6579)|
| 1:49:47| And after listening to all this tonight, it kind of scares me because it doesn't sound like the whole homeless issue is intended for actually homeless families,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=6587)|
| 1:49:57| only individuals with some type of mental or abusive problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=6597)|
| 1:50:06| I'm more worried about the children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=6606)|
| 1:50:08| The children don't seem to count anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=6608)|
| 1:50:11| When you take an eight complex apartment building and you only put one person per unit, that could be eight families in there, not just eight individual people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=6611)|
| 1:50:24| And these children are on the street just like these adults, that two-thirds of them put themselves there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=6624)|
| 1:50:34| I do agree people need help, but people also need to step up and help themselves as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=6634)|
| 1:50:41| Our community may be small.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=6641)|
| 1:50:44| We have a petition with only 85 names.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=6644)|
| 1:50:47| That is only a three to four block radius of the site that they are proposing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=6647)|
| 1:50:52| The for sale sign that they had on the site itself did not come down until the night after we were invited to our meeting at Enskip Church.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=6652)|
| 1:51:03| We had no way of really knowing what was going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=6663)|
| 1:51:07| And we were told that Helen Ross McNabb was part of the mayor's 10-year tenure program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=6667)|
| 1:51:16| So they were piggybacking themselves on and letting us think that it didn't matter what we thought about anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=6676)|
| 1:51:22| This was city government at work, and it was going to be crammed down our throats whether we liked it or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=6682)|
| 1:51:30| And I was really sorry to see Mr. Smelser leave because he was a sparring partner for me at the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=6690)|
| 1:51:41| I appreciate the chance to speak my piece.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=6701)|
| 1:51:44| I do hope we can come to some conclusions to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=6704)|
| 1:51:47| And I do appreciate the fact that you understand Helen Ross McNabb is piggybacking themselves onto this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=6707)|
| 1:51:55| This is a problem that everybody needs to work on together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=6715)|
| 1:52:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=6720)|
| 1:52:01| Thank you, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=6721)|
| 1:52:03| Jason Grail, I hope I pronounced it correctly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=6723)|
| 1:52:06| The time is 648.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=6726)|
| 1:52:08| Sarah, give us your name and address, and you have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=6728)|
| 1:52:13| Jason Grail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=6733)|
| 1:52:14| I live at 4813 Costa Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=6734)|
| 1:52:17| As Kathy mentioned, we do have a petition with 85 signatures saying that they are against this particular property to have this building built.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=6737)|
| 1:52:27| A couple of concerns I have are, you know, they're talking about an eightplex with single individuals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=6747)|
| 1:52:33| This is a family-oriented neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=6753)|
| 1:52:35| A lot of people have children, small children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=6755)|
| 1:52:37| Why couldn't it be four families with children versus eight individuals?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=6757)|
| 1:52:43| That was one of the points I wanted to make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=6763)|
| 1:52:46| Another one is, as far as mental illness and substance abuse is concerned with the Helen Ross McNabb project on this particular site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=6766)|
| 1:52:54| what kind of screening are they going to have for the people with substance abuse problems?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=6774)|
| 1:52:59| I mean, are they going to be two years clean?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=6779)|
| 1:53:01| Are they going to be two months clean before they get elected as eligible for supportive housing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=6781)|
| 1:53:11| As far as mental illness is concerned, you know, that's a very broad spectrum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=6791)|
| 1:53:15| I would really like to know a more in-depth description of what they, as Helen Ross McNabb, classify as dangerously mental ill,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=6795)|
| 1:53:27| whether it may be schizophrenia, bipolarness, or anything like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=6807)|
| 1:53:33| If the unit has to go up anyway, which I know the council hasn't made a decision yet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=6813)|
| 1:53:39| not only should it be provided with a caseworker all the time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=6819)|
| 1:53:44| I feel an off-duty officer should live in the properties with these individuals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=6824)|
| 1:53:48| until we do see that it is going to be a successful project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=6828)|
| 1:53:52| just to make sure that the families around these facilities are still safe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=6832)|
| 1:53:59| I appreciate the council hearing me out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=6839)|
| 1:54:03| If I need to present this to anybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=6843)|
| 1:54:06| If you have that petition entered into the record, if you provide it to Ms. Wilson here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=6846)|
| 1:54:10| she'll make sure that it is entered into the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=6850)|
| 1:54:13| And also we'll just ask Ms. Wilson if you'll make a copy of that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=6853)|
| 1:54:16| and have it delivered over to the commission office, so if commissioners would like to see that also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=6856)|
| 1:54:22| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=6862)|
| 1:54:23| Jonathan Schmultz.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=6863)|
| 1:54:28| Is Jonathan still here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=6868)|
| 1:54:31| Diana Kahn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=6871)|
| 1:54:39| Good to see you again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=6879)|
| 1:54:40| The time is 651.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=6880)|
| 1:54:42| Give us your name and address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=6882)|
| 1:54:43| You have five minutes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=6883)|
| 1:54:45| My name is Diana Kahn, and I live at 704 Hickman Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=6885)|
| 1:54:49| I live in the old Sevier community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=6889)|
| 1:54:54| And I was supposed to say whether I was for or against this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=6894)|
| 1:54:58| and I didn't know which to put down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=6898)|
| 1:55:01| I'm for properly sited, genuinely supportive housing for the chronically homeless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=6901)|
| 1:55:11| My problem is that I, one, don't think so far the suggestions for where or the property that's been bought| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=6911)|
| 1:55:20| is properly sited for this kind of facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=6920)|
| 1:55:26| And the other is that from what we were told at our community meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=6926)|
| 1:55:30| it's not going to be, the services are not going to be supportive either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=6930)|
| 1:55:36| We've had prior experience in my neighborhood with a project to house the homeless,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=6936)|
| 1:55:43| I guess chronically homeless, because these were individuals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=6943)|
| 1:55:47| And another nonprofit put them into some World's Fair apartments that had been built in my neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=6947)|
| 1:55:55| back when the World's Fair occurred.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=6955)|
| 1:55:58| And they had, these folks were either mentally ill or they were substance abusers or both.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=6958)|
| 1:56:05| A lot of people, they're homeless or both.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=6965)|
| 1:56:08| They were getting disability checks so they could pay rent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=6968)|
| 1:56:12| So the nonprofit would collect the rent and when the checks came and then give the tenants the rest of the money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=6972)|
| 1:56:19| And it was a disaster because the services provided were,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=6979)|
| 1:56:25| a caseworker came by about once a week to check and see how they were.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=6985)|
| 1:56:29| What happened was these folks, some of them set fire to their apartment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=6989)|
| 1:56:34| And the fire department came.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=6994)|
| 1:56:37| They had fights with each other and the police came.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=6997)|
| 1:56:40| They fanned out through that part of the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=7000)|
| 1:56:43| They vandalized, they panhandled, and they committed petty theft.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=7003)|
| 1:56:48| Pretty soon we had the fire department, the police department, codes all on our side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=7008)|
| 1:56:53| And these folks had been put into old buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=7013)|
| 1:56:56| So codes went in and condemned the buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=7016)|
| 1:56:59| And that resulted in these renters, renters have to move out right away if a building's condemned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=7019)|
| 1:57:06| And so they were homeless again, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=7026)|
| 1:57:10| It didn't help these folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=7030)|
| 1:57:12| It must have been very discouraging to the homeless people that had been put in there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=7032)|
| 1:57:17| because first they were living under bridges or in the woods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=7037)|
| 1:57:21| Some of the woods in my neighborhood had homeless folks living in them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=7041)|
| 1:57:25| And then they were put in these apartments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=7045)|
| 1:57:28| And then they got tossed out of the apartments and I guess they were back in the woods or under the bridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=7048)|
| 1:57:34| This is not the way to do this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=7054)|
| 1:57:37| And yet what Governor Ross McNabb said to us at our neighborhood meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=7057)|
| 1:57:42| was quite similar to what they apparently said to NSKIP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=7062)|
| 1:57:45| They said, We have bought this piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=7065)|
| 1:57:47| We're going to build these apartments on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=7067)|
| 1:57:50| Get used to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=7070)|
| 1:57:52| They said it more nicely than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=7072)|
| 1:57:55| They were much more polite than that about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=7075)|
| 1:57:58| And when we asked about the supportive services,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=7078)|
| 1:58:02| they said that no, they weren't going to have any sort of live-in case manager.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=7082)|
| 1:58:07| They were going to have a case manager come by about once a week and check these folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=7087)|
| 1:58:10| and see how they were, see if they were still there, I guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=7090)|
| 1:58:13| or if they'd set fire to their apartments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=7093)|
| 1:58:16| We saw the same disaster coming down the road that we'd already endured once.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=7096)|
| 1:58:22| Besides which, this doesn't solve the chronic homeless problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=7102)|
| 1:58:27| It just makes it worse as far as I can see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=7107)|
| 1:58:31| And if we're going to do this project, we ought to do it right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=7111)|
| 1:58:35| And I'm in favor of doing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=7115)|
| 1:58:37| But I think that you need to clearly define the services that are going to be provided,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=7117)|
| 1:58:44| and you ought to contract with the nonprofits so that they have to provide those services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=7124)|
| 1:58:51| And I think you ought to clearly define the requirements for the siting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=7131)|
| 1:58:56| for the location of these things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=7136)|
| 1:58:58| Because Mr. Klont's list of what needed to be there for proper siting, I wrote it down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=7138)|
| 1:59:06| I wrote part last night, and I wrote down the rest of it when he showed that slide tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=7146)|
| 1:59:11| The site in my neighborhood doesn't fulfill a good many of these criteria.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=7151)|
| 1:59:19| I do indeed think there ought to be a moratorium until we sort this out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=7159)|
| 1:59:24| and nail down the service requirements and the siting requirements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=7164)|
| 1:59:29| and until we talk some more about how we're going to financially sustain this program in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=7169)|
| 1:59:36| The federal government's going to give us a start, but we're going to have to keep it going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=7176)|
| 1:59:42| And this is permanent housing for these folks, we hope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=7182)|
| 1:59:46| And so they're going to stay in it, and they're going to continue to need services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=7186)|
| 1:59:50| Maybe they'll get better and need fewer over the years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=7190)|
| 1:59:53| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=7193)|
| 1:59:55| But we need to think about the cost, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=7195)|
| 1:59:57| And I thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=7197)|
| 1:59:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=7199)|
| 2:00:01| Bert Rosen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=7201)|
| 2:00:04| He's out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=7204)|
| 2:00:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=7205)|
| 2:00:06| Just outside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=7206)|
| 2:00:07| Ed Eckenrod.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=7207)|
| 2:00:10| The time is 6.56.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=7210)|
| 2:00:12| What's your name and address?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=7212)|
| 2:00:13| You have up to five minutes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=7213)|
| 2:00:15| Ed Eckenrod.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=7215)|
| 2:00:16| I live at 302 Chickamauga Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=7216)|
| 2:00:18| I'm president of Oakwood-Lincoln Park Neighborhood Association| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=7218)|
| 2:00:21| and the incoming president of COIN, which is the Council of Involved Neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=7221)|
| 2:00:27| Not to reiterate what Diane and others have said, those are the concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=7227)|
| 2:00:32| COIN represents a lot of the poorer neighborhoods, especially in the empowerment zone area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=7232)|
| 2:00:39| And I think a couple concerns that I would have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=7239)|
| 2:00:42| one, as we develop this task force that has been stated that neighborhoods be part of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=7242)|
| 2:00:48| but be a part of it in a deliberative sense with a deliberative voice and simply not consultative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=7248)|
| 2:00:54| So often neighborhoods are either not consulted or when they are, it is simply that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=7254)|
| 2:01:00| But in this task force,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=7260)|
| 2:01:01| you should form a request that we have equal voice in how these are determined.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=7261)|
| 2:01:08| And in the site factoring, we would also, when we talk about siting, Diane Conn alluded to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=7268)|
| 2:01:15| but more expressly that the standards and criteria also be developed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=7275)|
| 2:01:20| just not where they're going to be, but the criteria and standards of occupancy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=7280)|
| 2:01:26| however you want to define that, be also stipulated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=7286)|
| 2:01:30| The other thing that concerns my neighborhood association is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=7290)|
| 2:01:35| when you talk about the fact that when these units are put in that, as Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=7295)|
| 2:01:41| Klont said, the value of the housing stock may go up in the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=7301)|
| 2:01:46| My concern is developers targeting the lower income neighborhoods are to the residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=7306)|
| 2:01:52| getting land much cheaper than they would in other neighborhoods in the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=7312)|
| 2:01:57| and erecting these various apartments, permanent housing apartments in the poor neighborhoods,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=7317)|
| 2:02:05| even though many of these poor neighbors are spread out through the county and the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=7325)|
| 2:02:10| that they would be targeted by developers because of the low cost of the housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=7330)|
| 2:02:17| I mean, the land to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=7337)|
| 2:02:21| Based on that theoretical assumption that the developer could say, well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=7341)|
| 2:02:24| if we put it here in your neighborhood, your values are going to rise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=7344)|
| 2:02:28| And I think that would, you know, that raises a red flag to me that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=7348)|
| 2:02:33| so I think when we talk to developers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=7353)|
| 2:02:36| the neighborhoods have to be part of that discussion with the developers as this goes forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=7356)|
| 2:02:40| COIN is not opposed, obviously not opposed to helping the needy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=7360)|
| 2:02:44| but, you know, that the neighborhoods have so long been left out of the process, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=7364)|
| 2:02:49| now we're coming here to say we need to be part of the process for it to be successful in the long term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=7369)|
| 2:02:56| Neighborhoods must be involved from start to finish in a very deliberative sense| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=7376)|
| 2:03:01| and not simply come to a meeting and be told this is the way it's going to be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=7381)|
| 2:03:06| but have a deliberative voice as this develops and goes forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=7386)|
| 2:03:11| So, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=7391)|
| 2:03:12| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=7392)|
| 2:03:13| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=7393)|
| 2:03:14| Suzanne McGee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=7394)|
| 2:03:19| Suzanne McGee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=7399)|
| 2:03:22| Did Bert Rosen come back in the room?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=7402)|
| 2:03:24| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=7404)|
| 2:03:25| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=7405)|
| 2:03:26| Well, that finishes up our public forum portion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=7406)|
| 2:03:28| We thank council and we thank commission for coming,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=7408)|
| 2:03:31| and I would just ask that one of the commissioners, Commissioner Briggs or Commissioner Harmon| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=7411)|
| 2:03:37| or Commissioner Saunders or any of those that are left,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=7417)|
| 2:03:41| please speak to your chairman and vice chairman about trying to determine what their two or three appointments you all will be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=7421)|
| 2:03:48| I think Craig Luthold, the vice chair, said you all would discuss this on Monday at your commission meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=7428)|
| 2:03:53| and then the council as a vice mayor, I'll sit back and figure out about our appointments to this task force.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=7433)|
| 2:03:59| Thank you all for coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part2?start=7439)|
