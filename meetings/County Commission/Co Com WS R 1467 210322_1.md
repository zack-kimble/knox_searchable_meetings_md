| 3:22:10| to investigate and prosecute offenders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=12130)|
| 3:22:14| I'm asking for one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=12134)|
| 3:22:15| I'd love to see four eventually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=12135)|
| 3:22:18| I'm asking for one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=12138)|
| 3:22:19| We can afford to hire one environmental officer to prosecute these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=12139)|
| 3:22:24| I know I rambled on and everything, but I would like to, Drew and Alana,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=12144)|
| 3:22:30| Alana, would you like to come up first since you've been here for a long time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=12150)|
| 3:22:34| Does everybody know Alana?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=12154)|
| 3:22:36| This is Alana McKissack from Keep Knoxville Beautiful,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=12156)|
| 3:22:40| and this is where a lot of this litter grant funding goes to in the Adopt-A-Road Program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=12160)|
| 3:22:45| If you could please state your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=12165)|
| 3:22:47| Alana McKissack, 2743 Wimpole Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=12167)|
| 3:22:52| I'm the executive director of Keep Knoxville Beautiful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=12172)|
| 3:22:54| We are a small environmental nonprofit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=12174)|
| 3:22:56| We have a staff of three that are fully volunteer run for litter pickups.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=12176)|
| 3:23:01| We do receive money from Knox County to do the litter education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=12181)|
| 3:23:05| We focus on a two-pronged approach, raising awareness, but also action through litter pickups.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=12185)|
| 3:23:13| The pandemic halted our cleanups for three months, but we are seeing an uptick in volunteers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=12193)|
| 3:23:20| But they're volunteers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=12200)|
| 3:23:21| They can't go on roads that even the litter crew couldn't go on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=12201)|
| 3:23:25| We don't have a sheriff's officer following us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=12205)|
| 3:23:28| We are solely just people out there picking up litter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=12208)|
| 3:23:31| We receive funds to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=12211)|
| 3:23:34| We are able to provide all the supplies for free.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=12214)|
| 3:23:36| So in the past year since this time last March, we've done around 300 pickups.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=12216)|
| 3:23:43| Less volunteers, though, because we do have to limit the amount of people that are out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=12223)|
| 3:23:47| We have picked up more litter, but we are doing more cleanups.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=12227)|
| 3:23:52| So, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=12232)|
| 3:23:54| I have a quick question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=12234)|
| 3:23:56| What's being done on the education side?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=12236)|
| 3:23:58| Because it seems like one of the ways to prevent litter is to try to get people to throw away less litter on the side of the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=12238)|
| 3:24:03| Instead of just if the problem is getting worse, what are we doing to address it on the front end?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=12243)|
| 3:24:07| So for us, we do a lot of in-school education and making sure people are aware of laws.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=12247)|
| 3:24:13| It is a full behavior change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=12253)|
| 3:24:16| People still don't know littering is a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=12256)|
| 3:24:19| They don't care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=12259)|
| 3:24:20| They don't see that it happens outside the back of their truck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=12260)|
| 3:24:24| I think we do a really good job with what we have, but there is always more that could be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=12264)|
| 3:24:34| Commissioner Ward?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=12274)|
| 3:24:37| I'll just tie this up in a vote real quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=12277)|
| 3:24:39| Carson, I would like you and I to go and meet with Clark Hammond| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=12279)|
| 3:24:45| and maybe see if we can get some of the judges to sit down with us and have a more in-depth discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=12285)|
| 3:24:50| Then we can look at maybe expanding the budget to help out a little bit more towards the litter crew next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=12290)|
| 3:24:55| I think that would be a good thing as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=12295)|
| 3:24:58| The law director has already had one meeting with the judge's clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=12298)|
| 3:25:04| Is that correct, the law director?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=12304)|
| 3:25:06| Yeah, general session court clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=12306)|
| 3:25:08| So let's wait to see what comes back from that discussion through there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=12308)|
| 3:25:13| I think right now the biggest holdup is COVID where we can't send them out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=12313)|
| 3:25:19| That was one of the questions I wanted to ask Clark Hammond tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=12319)|
| 3:25:23| I know these guys, the engineering crew probably can't take them out right now because of COVID,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=12323)|
| 3:25:28| but we're getting closer to the end of that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=12328)|
| 3:25:31| I think you and I just having a friendly discussion with the judges might go a lot further| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=12331)|
| 3:25:36| than trying to go through all the procedural routes and just say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=12336)|
| 3:25:39| hey, you know, when we get back to this time, can you guys just do more litter crew stuff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=12339)|
| 3:25:46| instead of just see what they have to say and what their feedback is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=12346)|
| 3:25:50| I've already, Commissioner Ward, I've already had that discussion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=12350)|
| 3:25:54| and I was told that no commissioner is going to tell her what to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=12354)|
| 3:25:58| That's fair. You can ask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=12358)|
| 3:26:00| Yeah, I mean, we'll do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=12360)|
| 3:26:04| We'll do the sunshine and then you and I and whoever will go to the law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=12364)|
| 3:26:09| Yeah, I think we just ask nicely, take them out for lunch, schmooze them a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=12369)|
| 3:26:15| It might come around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=12375)|
| 3:26:17| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=12377)|
| 3:26:18| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=12378)|
| 3:26:20| Commissioner Daly, I wanted to ask you a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=12380)|
| 3:26:23| My mind's a bit foggy on this because I know this is something that we've been discussing for years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=12383)|
| 3:26:30| but when it comes back to the state and law, and I may be incorrect about this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=12390)|
| 3:26:37| I don't know why it's sticking to my head,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=12397)|
| 3:26:40| but it seems like part of the issue was the smaller counties that don't have solid waste facilities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=12400)|
| 3:26:46| are the resources to do the DUI crews.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=12406)|
| 3:26:50| There was a question of whether it was right for a DUI offender in a county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=12410)|
| 3:26:57| that couldn't do the litter pickup service for a reduction in sentence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=12417)|
| 3:27:04| versus one that was in a county that could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=12424)|
| 3:27:07| Am I getting this confused?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=12427)|
| 3:27:10| No, the actual reason the law was changed is that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=12430)|
| 3:27:13| Houston County could not afford to have someone to go out and follow,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=12433)|
| 3:27:19| take DUI drivers out to pick up litter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=12439)|
| 3:27:24| They did not have the funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=12444)|
| 3:27:26| Houston County's probably got 10,000 residents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=12446)|
| 3:27:30| where in Knox County we've got plenty of funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=12450)|
| 3:27:33| So that's the reason that the law was changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=12453)|
| 3:27:36| But was it due to not just the fact they didn't have the funds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=12456)|
| 3:27:40| but the equal punishment laws across the state?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=12460)|
| 3:27:45| No, that had nothing to do with it because this code,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=12465)|
| 3:27:51| TCEA 55-10402 gives the judges the freedom to do what they want to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=12471)|
| 3:27:58| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=12478)|
| 3:28:01| Any further discussion on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=12481)|
| 3:28:04| Commissioner Buston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=12484)|
| 3:28:08| We have all of our solid waste facilities out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=12488)|
| 3:28:11| and I've been out to mine both, I've got two in my district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=12491)|
| 3:28:15| and I go in there and I watch a truck come in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=12495)|
| 3:28:18| that's got those little high sideboards on the side of it that they get rid of their trash,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=12498)|
| 3:28:24| and I was riding behind one of those and they don't keep them covered,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=12504)|
| 3:28:27| and I thought there was a law against that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=12507)|
| 3:28:30| I've seen people drive down the road that's got yard waste packed up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=12510)|
| 3:28:36| not covered up, and it falling out on the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=12516)|
| 3:28:40| And then I see these compact containers that we have at our waste facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=12520)|
| 3:28:47| They put a little piece of mesh over the back of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=12527)|
| 3:28:52| and they go down the road and they go toward the landfill,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=12532)|
| 3:28:56| and I see those just kind of easing out the sides of that because they pack those so full,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=12536)|
| 3:29:01| and it's coming away from these commercial and even our own waste facilities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=12541)|
| 3:29:05| that we're taking it to the dump that's falling out on the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=12545)|
| 3:29:09| Is there anything that you can do when they come in there and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=12549)|
| 3:29:14| and you didn't cover it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=12554)|
| 3:29:17| Again, Drew Thurman, Director of Solid Waste, 205 West Baxter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=12557)|
| 3:29:23| It's really difficult.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=12563)|
| 3:29:26| We have a very limited amount of time and staff to have any interactions with folks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=12566)|
| 3:29:31| and most of the time when we're interacting with folks at the convenience centers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=12571)|
| 3:29:34| our staff is trying to get it to put it in the right container.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=12574)|
| 3:29:39| We're talking about folks that make $13 an hour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=12579)|
| 3:29:43| They do not have any authority to enforce laws.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=12583)|
| 3:29:49| They're not law enforcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=12589)|
| 3:29:51| So they're generally there to just directly, yes, that is recyclable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=12591)|
| 3:29:55| It goes here. Yes, this is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=12595)|
| 3:29:57| And we have a don't argue with the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=12597)|
| 3:29:59| These are retail establishments, even though it's a county service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=12599)|
| 3:30:05| So I guess the answer is we probably could, on the right day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=12605)|
| 3:30:10| when it's not very busy, say, hey, you know, you really should have a covered load,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=12610)|
| 3:30:16| but it's still not the Solid Waste Department's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=12616)|
| 3:30:19| or anybody in the Solid Waste Division's role to enforce that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=12619)|
| 3:30:23| because we're not law enforcement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=12623)|
| 3:30:25| which is what Commissioner Daley had brought up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=12625)|
| 3:30:29| is wanting some enforcement personnel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=12629)|
| 3:30:32| and that's been submitted with the budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=12632)|
| 3:30:36| and so that's in a budget request right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=12636)|
| 3:30:39| is to have someone that would be an enforcement person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=12639)|
| 3:30:42| But we're still talking one person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=12642)|
| 3:30:44| We're seven convenience centers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=12644)|
| 3:30:46| and we have thousands of cars come through every day, 45,000 roughly a week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=12646)|
| 3:30:52| And so when they're coming through,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=12652)|
| 3:30:54| we're trying to prevent trash going in the cardboard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=12654)|
| 3:30:58| or trash going into the bulky bin| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=12658)|
| 3:31:03| or people not throwing a couch in the trash.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=12663)|
| 3:31:05| So they have a bunch of things they're trying to do at a convenience center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=12665)|
| 3:31:10| that they're trying to provide a good user experience,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=12670)|
| 3:31:16| not bark out things at folks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=12676)|
| 3:31:18| and also basically provide that service,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=12678)|
| 3:31:20| which a lot of people count on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=12680)|
| 3:31:22| people really count on the convenience centers as their waste solution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=12682)|
| 3:31:26| So if we had, like, say just two, instead of one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=12686)|
| 3:31:30| if we had two and they went different locations, different days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=12690)|
| 3:31:35| the word gets around that you go in there, it's uncovered,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=12695)|
| 3:31:38| you're going to get hit with a fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=12698)|
| 3:31:40| And after a while, that word will get around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=12700)|
| 3:31:42| I think that you're on to something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=12702)|
| 3:31:44| I think if people were cited for litter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=12704)|
| 3:31:46| whether it's at convenience centers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=12706)|
| 3:31:48| or they were given a citation for throwing a cigarette butt on the side of the road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=12708)|
| 3:31:53| or someone in bags of trash,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=12713)|
| 3:31:56| maybe you got their name and address in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=12716)|
| 3:32:00| If someone got a citation, they might say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=12720)|
| 3:32:03| hey, you know, I had to pay some money or get called to a court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=12723)|
| 3:32:07| I think enforcement is definitely part of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=12727)|
| 3:32:10| It's part of that strategy to minimize litter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=12730)|
| 3:32:13| Alana and I were talking before this meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=12733)|
| 3:32:16| It's a community problem, litter is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=12736)|
| 3:32:20| Some people are purposely throwing litter out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=12740)|
| 3:32:22| Some people it's blowing out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=12742)|
| 3:32:24| As you mentioned, it might even come out of our trucks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=12744)|
| 3:32:27| There's maybe no better way to design that truck currently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=12747)|
| 3:32:30| to haul stuff from our centers to the landfill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=12750)|
| 3:32:34| But there are some things that, you know, there's the blatant people throwing it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=12754)|
| 3:32:37| Then you roll a window down and maybe a wrapper goes out of your car.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=12757)|
| 3:32:41| Some of it's intentional.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=12761)|
| 3:32:42| Some of it's unintentional.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=12762)|
| 3:32:45| We are part of that solution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=12765)|
| 3:32:48| So we have safe disposal at seven locations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=12768)|
| 3:32:52| And we're very generous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=12772)|
| 3:32:54| We're open 58 hours a week, Monday through Friday and Saturday 7 to 3,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=12774)|
| 3:32:59| Monday through Friday 8 to 6 and Saturday 7 to 3,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=12779)|
| 3:33:01| where you can go and dispose of trash, basically household trash, free of charge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=12781)|
| 3:33:06| It's part of your taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=12786)|
| 3:33:09| So if you're not doing the right thing, you're really,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=12789)|
| 3:33:11| you're definitely doing something shady if you're intentionally littering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=12791)|
| 3:33:16| And then we also have this other group, the Litter Crew.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=12796)|
| 3:33:20| We have five folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=12800)|
| 3:33:21| They're going out every single day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=12801)|
| 3:33:23| You can report litter on the website.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=12803)|
| 3:33:25| You can call us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=12805)|
| 3:33:26| We have a variety of ways of reporting littered roads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=12806)|
| 3:33:29| Even if you report a state road or a city road, we kind of, we hand that off to folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=12809)|
| 3:33:34| We have a really good system of taking those complaints in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=12814)|
| 3:33:38| And then our crews out there are actually pulling litter off the side of the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=12818)|
| 3:33:42| So we get these really angry people at this time of year, January, February, March,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=12822)|
| 3:33:45| because all of the vegetation has died back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=12825)|
| 3:33:48| And they're driving down the road and they're like, man, look at all this trash.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=12828)|
| 3:33:52| It's all of a sudden appeared.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=12832)|
| 3:33:54| It didn't appear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=12834)|
| 3:33:55| It's been there all year long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=12835)|
| 3:33:56| And to that effect, if we do have less people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=12836)|
| 3:33:59| and less resources to pick up litter on the side of the road, it's true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=12839)|
| 3:34:03| Maybe it accumulates and there's more than there was a year ago or two years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=12843)|
| 3:34:09| But we're actually, you know, we've had folks call very angry about a road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=12849)|
| 3:34:14| and then call us back three days later saying, how come you haven't done it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=12854)|
| 3:34:18| We actually picked 70 bags of trash off of the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=12858)|
| 3:34:21| And they're still saying, hey, you're not doing anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=12861)|
| 3:34:24| And we are doing stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=12864)|
| 3:34:26| But if you put all of that, I guess what I would finish on is I don't know if you doubled| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=12866)|
| 3:34:34| or tripled the size of the litter crew if that's going to make a difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=12874)|
| 3:34:37| I mean, it's going to make a difference on the side that we can pull off,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=12877)|
| 3:34:40| but it's not going to stop it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=12880)|
| 3:34:42| And Alana's been in – you know, we fund that through the litter grant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=12882)|
| 3:34:46| 33% of our litter grant goes to – or 35% goes to Alana.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=12886)|
| 3:34:51| It's about $60,000 a year in education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=12891)|
| 3:34:53| Every single year we're educating people that litter's wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=12893)|
| 3:34:57| And we're obviously not making a dent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=12897)|
| 3:34:59| There's still litter everywhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=12899)|
| 3:35:01| So I don't know what the solution is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=12901)|
| 3:35:04| And I think it's a shame.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=12904)|
| 3:35:07| And I feel shame when I see litter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=12907)|
| 3:35:09| I feel shame that we have to send county workers to pick up trash off the side of the road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=12909)|
| 3:35:15| that people in our community allowed to be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=12915)|
| 3:35:19| I'm very proud that a lot of folks organize cleanups.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=12919)|
| 3:35:22| We have adopter folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=12922)|
| 3:35:24| We have people do one-off cleanups.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=12924)|
| 3:35:27| And it's going to be – I don't know what gets us from a bunch of littered roads| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=12927)|
| 3:35:33| to a bunch of clean roads, but it's not going to be just more litter crew.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=12933)|
| 3:35:36| It's not going to be just enforcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=12936)|
| 3:35:38| It's not just going to be TARP laws.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=12938)|
| 3:35:39| It's going to be a community-wide approach where we decide this is not what we want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=12939)|
| 3:35:44| our community to look like anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=12944)|
| 3:35:46| So I'll just –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=12946)|
| 3:35:48| Commissioner Daley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=12948)|
| 3:35:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=12950)|
| 3:35:52| On Drew's point, John Sevier Highway Convenience Center is on a 50-mile-an-hour speed limit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=12952)|
| 3:36:02| but it seems like it's 65 sometimes, and they do not secure their loads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=12962)|
| 3:36:07| Trash goes all over the road, spreads out and everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=12967)|
| 3:36:10| So I see that we created the problem, and I say we, not this county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=12970)|
| 3:36:18| If we don't enforce the Cover Your Load law on Governor John Sevier Highway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=12978)|
| 3:36:22| which is 95 percent of where it falls off on, is on John Sevier Highway, that's our fault.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=12982)|
| 3:36:29| All it's going to take is two or three times that we get citations, and they're going to stop it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=12989)|
| 3:36:34| And that will improve it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=12994)|
| 3:36:35| Will that solve it always?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=12995)|
| 3:36:37| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=12997)|
| 3:36:39| This environmental officer last year, I believe it was, or a year or so ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=12999)|
| 3:36:44| you remember the guy that come in and had the refrigerator, and they said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=13004)|
| 3:36:48| you can't dump the refrigerator there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=13008)|
| 3:36:50| Next thing you know, it was over on Tarwater Road, and we had to go get it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=13010)|
| 3:36:54| We've got to stop stuff like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=13014)|
| 3:36:56| The way we're going to stop stuff like that is start writing fines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=13016)|
| 3:37:00| And I'll say that, and I'll keep saying that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=13020)|
| 3:37:02| And the second way is let's get some judges there in 2022 that will do their job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=13022)|
| 3:37:08| One last issue about the probation side is there is kind of a, I don't know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=13028)|
| 3:37:16| if you're taking a shower and you turn the hot water up, it takes a minute before the water gets warm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=13036)|
| 3:37:20| It is much like that with the probationers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=13040)|
| 3:37:23| In 2014, they changed that DUI law, and we actually had probationers still for another year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=13043)|
| 3:37:29| because there are people who normally have a year to complete that service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=13049)|
| 3:37:34| I don't exactly know all the details of this, but it's actually the General Sessions Court, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=13054)|
| 3:37:40| They issued a court order saying that they're not going to allow sentencing of community service hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=13060)|
| 3:37:48| They also, I think, zeroed out if you had community service hours before COVID,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=13068)|
| 3:37:53| and that was the only thing that was preventing you from getting your, being right with the law or whatever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=13073)|
| 3:37:59| serving your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=13079)|
| 3:38:00| They eliminated that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=13080)|
| 3:38:01| So even if tomorrow, and we were actually, as you said, Sharmallon and Sam Lee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=13081)|
| 3:38:09| we'd made a lot of progress on getting a lot more people coming back our way that were probationers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=13089)|
| 3:38:16| going through Knox County probation, paying that fee, and then coming to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=13096)|
| 3:38:21| That's been zeroed out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=13101)|
| 3:38:23| If that magically turned tomorrow and everybody started sentencing everyone to three days of community service tomorrow,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=13103)|
| 3:38:31| it might be a year before some of those people actually show up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=13111)|
| 3:38:34| So just letting you know, there is a bit of a lag on there, even if it's restored tomorrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=13114)|
| 3:38:40| I might be six months, 12 months before I start seeing those folks regularly that we take out with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=13120)|
| 3:38:45| So that's why we have the part-time money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=13125)|
| 3:38:47| I do have full-time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=13127)|
| 3:38:49| We also have a pot of money for part-time folks, and we've hired them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=13129)|
| 3:38:54| This is good for them, but there's been some turnover at the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=13134)|
| 3:38:57| and so as we've hired part-time, they've moved into full-time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=13137)|
| 3:39:00| So it's been kind of a struggle on our side to keep, say, 10 people, which I would like to have on a daily basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=13140)|
| 3:39:07| We're still just having that five on a regular basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=13147)|
| 3:39:12| Commissioner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=13152)|
| 3:39:13| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=13153)|
| 3:39:14| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=13154)|
| 3:39:15| Is Zach back there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=13155)|
| 3:39:16| It is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=13156)|
| 3:39:17| Zach's back here, back up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=13157)|
| 3:39:19| Zach is the convenience center, is that correct, Zach?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=13159)|
| 3:39:23| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=13163)|
| 3:39:24| He's the convenience center operations manager.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=13164)|
| 3:39:26| Thank you, Zach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=13166)|
| 3:39:27| You all do a great job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=13167)|
| 3:39:29| Drew, I understand why they zeroed out community service in 2000 for COVID,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=13169)|
| 3:39:34| but you had said General Sessions did it in 2014?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=13174)|
| 3:39:38| No, sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=13178)|
| 3:39:39| So the 2014, that was that DUI law change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=13179)|
| 3:39:42| It was really odd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=13182)|
| 3:39:43| It went through very fast.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=13183)|
| 3:39:46| I've since put a Google alert on new law, Tennessee, waste, recycling, litter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=13186)|
| 3:39:52| Is that what I was trying to remember earlier?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=13192)|
| 3:39:55| Yeah, it was like 2014 or 2015,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=13195)|
| 3:39:58| and it eliminated the 24 hours of community service,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=13198)|
| 3:40:02| which is eight hours times three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=13202)|
| 3:40:04| So they do it by day block.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=13204)|
| 3:40:07| And they substituted it for everybody who gets a DUI must go spend one night in jail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=13207)|
| 3:40:12| And I think Commissioner Daley was on something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=13212)|
| 3:40:16| There were counties that did not like the burden of choosing how they had to handle these DUI folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=13216)|
| 3:40:24| And there was a constituency that was maybe the Mothers Against Drunk Driving| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=13224)|
| 3:40:30| that was very pro getting anybody who commits DUI crimes should serve time in jail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=13230)|
| 3:40:35| And so we actually pursued trying to get that reversed or even a private act for Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=13235)|
| 3:40:42| The mayor at the time, we spoke to our delegation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=13242)|
| 3:40:46| and there was a period where that ship sailed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=13246)|
| 3:40:50| and that's when we started paying to have full-time staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=13250)|
| 3:40:55| And so we had full-time staff as well as probationers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=13255)|
| 3:40:59| But when COVID hit, then it's just now it's just the only thing we have is the full-time staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=13259)|
| 3:41:04| and full and part-time staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=13264)|
| 3:41:06| So we do not have any probationers and have not had any since COVID hit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=13266)|
| 3:41:10| So it's been a year now that it's been just our folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=13270)|
| 3:41:13| But the crew we do have in place are in many ways more productive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=13273)|
| 3:41:18| than some of the probationer folks we got.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=13278)|
| 3:41:23| Yeah, I mean, they're there every morning at 730 ready to go out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=13283)|
| 3:41:27| And they're getting paid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=13287)|
| 3:41:28| They have health care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=13288)|
| 3:41:29| They love their county job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=13289)|
| 3:41:31| They're happy to have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=13291)|
| 3:41:32| It's a stress-free job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=13292)|
| 3:41:34| Some people volunteer to pick up litter on the side of the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=13294)|
| 3:41:36| These guys are getting paid for it, getting benefits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=13296)|
| 3:41:39| So I'm very proud of my crew.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=13299)|
| 3:41:42| I would like to have a few more with the part-time folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=13302)|
| 3:41:46| But we have the money there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=13306)|
| 3:41:47| It's just been a matter of keeping the folks, keeping them in, keeping them in the pipeline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=13307)|
| 3:41:55| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=13315)|
| 3:41:56| You're welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=13316)|
| 3:41:57| Thank you, Mr. Thurman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=13317)|
| 3:41:58| Our last item of the night is just a quick discussion about the fiscal year 22 budget hearings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=13318)|
| 3:42:05| and schedules you have in your packet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=13325)|
| 3:42:07| You've been provided two options to think about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=13327)|
| 3:42:11| One that essentially marries up our time against at least one of the three| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=13331)|
| 3:42:19| or two of the three against commission meetings or work sessions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=13339)|
| 3:42:24| Another option is doing them on days that have nothing to do with work sessions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=13344)|
| 3:42:30| or commission meetings, or there could be a third or fourth or fifth or sixth option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=13350)|
| 3:42:34| But one of the things that I noticed in the last few years is we tend to not make a decision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=13354)|
| 3:42:39| wait until May, scramble.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=13359)|
| 3:42:41| Everybody's trying to scramble with their schedules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=13361)|
| 3:42:43| And I'd like to get ahead of it this year a bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=13363)|
| 3:42:46| We know when the mayor's budget presentation is going to be on a date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=13366)|
| 3:42:50| We don't know any other details yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=13370)|
| 3:42:52| It's not been set.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=13372)|
| 3:42:53| So I'd like to hear from you all on what your preference is so we can go ahead| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=13373)|
| 3:42:57| and lock things into the calendar and prepare everybody and our staff for our budget season.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=13377)|
| 3:43:06| For clarification, you're wanting us to kind of vote on an option one or option two?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=13386)|
| 3:43:11| I'm just presenting two options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=13391)|
| 3:43:12| I don't mean vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=13392)|
| 3:43:13| I'm presenting two options to you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=13393)|
| 3:43:15| I'd like to walk away tonight with a plan of how we're going to move forward with our budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=13395)|
| 3:43:19| so we can set the schedule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=13399)|
| 3:43:24| Are you asking?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=13404)|
| 3:43:25| Does anybody have an opinion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=13405)|
| 3:43:27| Commissioner Hill?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=13407)|
| 3:43:28| Commissioner Dale?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=13408)|
| 3:43:29| Commissioner Hill?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=13409)|
| 3:43:31| I would prefer we go with option one, one and done, get it wrapped up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=13411)|
| 3:43:41| But I'm not married to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=13421)|
| 3:43:44| By the way, at least several of these that say CCB Maine will probably be in the small assembly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=13424)|
| 3:43:51| not in the main, because there's some conflict.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=13431)|
| 3:43:53| But we can do CTV budget hearings over there as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=13433)|
| 3:43:57| Commissioner Dale?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=13437)|
| 3:43:59| That was one of my questions, whether it had not been available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=13439)|
| 3:44:05| I would kind of, you know, either one would work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=13445)|
| 3:44:08| But like I said a minute ago, with this $92 million that's coming,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=13448)|
| 3:44:12| I think we need to kind of stall as much as we can to see where we can do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=13452)|
| 3:44:18| We might not be able to do anything to help save on our budgets or anything like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=13458)|
| 3:44:23| But we could always revisit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=13463)|
| 3:44:26| If I was choosing, I would choose option two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=13466)|
| 3:44:29| But that's just for that reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=13469)|
| 3:44:32| Let's extend it out until we can find out what the American Relief Act says we can and cannot do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=13472)|
| 3:44:40| And just to be clear, the option one sort of is where we would have regular work sessions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=13480)|
| 3:44:45| or commission meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=13485)|
| 3:44:46| We would have to sort of suspend our work session, go into a budget session, and go back and forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=13486)|
| 3:44:52| Option two is clean, where we would have no other purpose other than to do the budgeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=13492)|
| 3:44:57| Commissioner Bealey?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=13497)|
| 3:44:59| Thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=13499)|
| 3:45:00| Yeah, I would probably lean toward option two as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=13500)|
| 3:45:03| I think it might be wishful thinking to think that we would have ample time during meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=13503)|
| 3:45:09| to vote on a budget on May 24th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=13509)|
| 3:45:11| That would be difficult.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=13511)|
| 3:45:13| Commissioner Schoonmaker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=13513)|
| 3:45:14| Thank you, Chairman Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=13514)|
| 3:45:15| I would prefer option two, too, just so it's not associated with any other meeting we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=13515)|
| 3:45:22| Plus, once the mayor presents his budget, we may want to call departments in to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=13522)|
| 3:45:28| hey, why did your department increase your budget 10%?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=13528)|
| 3:45:32| And actually hear it from the horse's mouth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=13532)|
| 3:45:34| So that way we could allow extra time if we had to invite different department directors in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=13534)|
| 3:45:41| to give us guidance on their budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=13541)|
| 3:45:44| And then, statutorily, we're not required to actually pass the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=13544)|
| 3:45:49| The drop-dead date would be June 30th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=13549)|
| 3:45:53| So I'm hearing consensus around option two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=13553)|
| 3:45:57| And we will double-check the small assembly room on the 10th and 17th next door| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=13557)|
| 3:46:04| for potential budget hearings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=13564)|
| 3:46:06| Does anybody have objection towards heading that direction?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=13566)|
| 3:46:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=13569)|
| 3:46:11| Commissioner Biggs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=13571)|
| 3:46:13| I was just wondering why we didn't look at May 31st as well for option two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=13573)|
| 3:46:22| Memorial Day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=13582)|
| 3:46:23| Memorial Day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=13583)|
| 3:46:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=13584)|
| 3:46:25| Well, there's my answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=13585)|
| 3:46:26| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=13586)|
| 3:46:28| You can come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=13588)|
| 3:46:29| We won't be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=13589)|
| 3:46:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=13592)|
| 3:46:33| So I will proceed with option two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=13593)|
| 3:46:35| Drusilla, if you will please double-check the small assembly room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=13595)|
| 3:46:38| If that's not available, perhaps we can find an alternative spot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=13598)|
| 3:46:41| But please mark on your calendars May 3rd, 10th, June 7th, and 14th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=13601)|
| 3:46:47| And we will adjust if needed, but we'll walk over the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=13607)|
| 3:46:49| Commissioner Daley?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=13609)|
| 3:46:51| Either we could add a discussion item next week| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=13611)|
| 3:46:54| or we can discuss it now setting up a committee to look at the American Relief Act.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=13614)|
| 3:46:59| I think we need a committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=13619)|
| 3:47:01| It could be all 11 commissioners we can meet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=13621)|
| 3:47:03| or we can set up a committee of six plus finance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=13623)|
| 3:47:07| and see which direction we need to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=13627)|
| 3:47:12| Is that something, since we're all on finance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=13632)|
| 3:47:14| that it could be rolled into the finance discussion, Chairman of the Finance Committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=13634)|
| 3:47:19| since we're already all there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=13639)|
| 3:47:21| It does, but finance only meets four times a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=13641)|
| 3:47:27| It could be, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=13647)|
| 3:47:29| Could I ask if you maybe could sit down with Director Caldwell| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=13649)|
| 3:47:33| and kind of formulate what the purpose would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=13653)|
| 3:47:35| If we're going to create a special called committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=13655)|
| 3:47:37| I'd like to have a little bit more definition on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=13657)|
| 3:47:39| and maybe that's something we can present next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=13659)|
| 3:47:42| Yeah, sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=13662)|
| 3:47:43| As soon as we find out how we can spend the money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=13663)|
| 3:47:47| and what we'll spend the money on, that's when we need to form the committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=13667)|
| 3:47:50| We don't have to do it right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=13670)|
| 3:47:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=13671)|
| 3:47:52| That could be yours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=13672)|
| 3:47:53| No, it's going to have to be within 60 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=13673)|
| 3:47:56| Commissioner Bailey, did you serve your light on, or is that just an arbitrary light?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=13676)|
| 3:47:59| I have an item of business, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=13679)|
| 3:48:01| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=13681)|
| 3:48:03| Are we through with the other?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=13683)|
| 3:48:05| We are through with that, and we're ready to adjourn until you have the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=13685)|
| 3:48:12| Go for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=13692)|
| 3:48:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=13693)|
| 3:48:15| I would like to make a recommendation to the body in the form of a motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=13695)|
| 3:48:20| that we add to the agenda for next week's meeting of the County Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=13700)|
| 3:48:25| ordinance 0-20-12-101 for consideration on second reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=13705)|
| 3:48:31| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=13711)|
| 3:48:36| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=13716)|
| 3:48:39| Well, Director Book is not here, but this is not a voting meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=13719)|
| 3:48:42| so I don't think we can vote to add anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=13722)|
| 3:48:46| Because the last motion made for that was to postpone it until a time definite in April.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=13726)|
| 3:48:54| It was, but I believe we can add it to an agenda by a two-thirds vote of this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=13734)|
| 3:49:00| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=13740)|
| 3:49:07| This is the Board of Health ordinance, is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=13747)|
| 3:49:09| Yes, it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=13749)|
| 3:49:18| Is Director Book gone by any chance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=13758)|
| 3:49:22| Does anybody know?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=13762)|
| 3:49:23| I want to make sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=13763)|
| 3:49:31| So just to be clear, you're making a motion to this body to add to the agenda next week| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=13771)|
| 3:49:37| the item that is currently slated for April to be moved up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=13777)|
| 3:49:41| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=13781)|
| 3:49:43| To the March commission meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=13783)|
| 3:49:49| Who is the second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=13789)|
| 3:49:51| I'm the second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=13791)|
| 3:49:54| You've got to give us a second here to just verify.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=13794)|
| 3:49:56| I want to look through the rules to verify.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=13796)|
| 3:49:58| I just want to make sure we can do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=13798)|
| 3:49:59| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=13799)|
| 3:50:00| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=13800)|
| 3:50:01| I think I recall it being discussed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=13801)|
| 3:50:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=13802)|
| 3:50:03| Well, if you guys can find the rule faster than I can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=13803)|
| 3:50:04| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=13804)|
| 3:50:05| I mean, somebody else might be looking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=13805)|
| 3:50:06| But I seem to recall it being discussed at the meeting when we postponed it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=13806)|
| 3:50:09| that we could bring it back up at any point during that 90 days with a two-thirds vote of this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=13809)|
| 3:50:14| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=13814)|
| 3:50:16| So the motion would be to amend the agenda because we've already set the agenda for next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=13816)|
| 3:50:21| No, we haven't set the agenda for next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=13821)|
| 3:50:23| We're not finished with this meeting yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=13823)|
| 3:50:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=13825)|
| 3:50:26| Well, I guess just somebody find me the rules since there's a question about it just to make sure that we.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=13826)|
| 3:50:34| We've always added items to the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=13834)|
| 3:50:38| I know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=13838)|
| 3:50:39| I'm just trying to make sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=13839)|
| 3:50:41| We've always added items to the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=13841)|
| 3:50:44| I know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=13844)|
| 3:50:45| I'm just trying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=13845)|
| 3:50:46| There's a question about whether we can or can't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=13846)|
| 3:50:47| I'd just like to verify it before we, since our law director's not here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=13847)|
| 3:50:52| I'm on, say, page six and seven, so I'm just reading through it real quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=13852)|
| 3:50:56| I'm on, say, page six and seven, so I'm just reading through it real quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=13856)|
| 3:51:26| I'm on, say, page six and seven.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=13886)|
| 3:51:56| Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=13916)|
| 3:52:07| Commissioner Schoonmakers asked the first vote on that ordinance was taken, I believe, in, was it December or November?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=13927)|
| 3:52:14| December.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=13934)|
| 3:52:15| December.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=13935)|
| 3:52:17| And then the vote was postponed in January to April.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=13937)|
| 3:52:21| So has it been 90 days?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=13941)|
| 3:52:24| I'm looking at page seven of our rules under section four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=13944)|
| 3:52:28| Commissioner, I'm looking at, however, any regular agenda item or similar or subject matter that's been acted on by the commission during its regular session may not be placed on the regular commission agenda for a period of 90 days without consenting vote of two-thirds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=13948)|
| 3:52:42| So as long as there's two-thirds there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=13962)|
| 3:52:44| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=13964)|
| 3:52:51| Well, rule four may cover it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=13971)|
| 3:52:52| I'm just double-checking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=13972)|
| 3:52:56| Our parliamentarian is usually our law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=13976)|
| 3:53:26| I'm just double-checking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=14006)|
| 3:53:52| I don't see anything in our rules that were prevented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=14032)|
| 3:54:06| I believe page seven, this would be section N number four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=14046)|
| 3:54:11| I'll just read it aloud.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=14051)|
| 3:54:14| All members that may be added to the agenda for all meetings except a special session of the commission by an affirmative vote of two-thirds, that would mean eight members of the membership of the commission or two-thirds of a quorum of a committee is applicable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=14054)|
| 3:54:27| However, any regular agenda item or similar subject matter as acted on by the commission during its regular session may not be placed on the regular commission agenda for a period of 90 days without consent, consenting vote of two-thirds of the members of the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=14067)|
| 3:54:40| The only exception to this rule would be a vote on the budget or the tax rate, which would require a majority vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=14080)|
| 3:54:47| So I believe the motion is proper and the second is proper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=14087)|
| 3:54:51| If for some reason the law department opines that it is not, then it could certainly be taken apart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=14091)|
| 3:54:58| So there is a proper motion on the floor with a second, and I'll open it up for discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=14098)|
| 3:55:03| Commissioner Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=14103)|
| 3:55:04| I'd like to make a substitute motion that we move to suspend the rules and bring this matter before the commission in the simple majority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=14104)|
| 3:55:18| You wouldn't need to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=14118)|
| 3:55:19| But just in case the law department looks at it and says, oh, you can't do that because the rules say you can't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=14119)|
| 3:55:26| I hear you saying you think we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=14126)|
| 3:55:29| I believe that it's a proper motion and second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=14129)|
| 3:55:31| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=14131)|
| 3:55:32| If the law department says it's not, it could be brought next week immediately at the same time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=14132)|
| 3:55:38| Fair enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=14138)|
| 3:55:39| Would you like to withdraw the sub?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=14139)|
| 3:55:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=14141)|
| 3:55:42| Additional discussion on this item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=14142)|
| 3:55:44| I just have one question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=14144)|
| 3:55:47| Given that there is still state legislature that is being talked about, I think, tomorrow?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=14147)|
| 3:55:54| Committee on Wednesday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=14154)|
| 3:55:56| Committee on Wednesday, and it's going through this week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=14156)|
| 3:56:00| Why rush this ahead of month when there's still stuff being done on a state level that may fundamentally change or alter what it is we're voting on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=14160)|
| 3:56:10| Is that a question for me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=14170)|
| 3:56:13| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=14173)|
| 3:56:14| I believe the county mayor spoke to that tonight, that this body, as well as Senator Briggs, that this body needs to act if it feels like it needs to act.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=14174)|
| 3:56:23| And then the state will do whatever the state does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=14183)|
| 3:56:26| And whatever the state does would certainly supersede us if it contradicts what we do tonight or next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=14186)|
| 3:56:32| But I see no reason not to follow through with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=14192)|
| 3:56:37| Commissioner Skinmaker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=14197)|
| 3:56:39| Well, and technically, the state law affects five other counties besides Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=14199)|
| 3:56:46| Yeah, but it would affect us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=14206)|
| 3:56:49| Is there other discussion on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=14209)|
| 3:56:52| So the motion, can you bring me that ordinance number again, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=14212)|
| 3:56:55| I just want to make sure we have it for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=14215)|
| 3:56:57| The ordinance number is 0-20-12-101.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=14217)|
| 3:57:02| And the motion is to add ordinance 0-20-12-101 on second reading to next week's commission meeting on the 29th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=14222)|
| 3:57:15| Motion by Commissioner Beeler, second by Commissioner Ward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=14235)|
| 3:57:19| Is that accurate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=14239)|
| 3:57:21| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=14241)|
| 3:57:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=14242)|
| 3:57:24| All those in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=14244)|
| 3:57:26| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=14246)|
| 3:57:27| Those opposed, please say nay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=14247)|
| 3:57:34| No, it actually would require a two-thirds vote now to be able to put it on next week's agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=14254)|
| 3:57:40| So let's do a roll call vote, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=14260)|
| 3:57:42| It's a two-thirds vote to add it to the agenda for next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=14262)|
| 3:57:46| And it would require eight members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=14266)|
| 3:57:49| Commissioner Lundy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=14269)|
