| 0:00:40| We need to go ahead and do our moment of silence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=40)|
| 0:00:43| and the pledge led by Ms. Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=43)|
| 0:00:49| Salute, pledge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=49)|

| 0:00:54| of the United States of America| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=54)|
| 0:00:57| and to the republic for which it stands,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=57)|
| 0:01:00| one nation, under God, indivisible,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=60)|
| 0:01:04| with liberty and justice for all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=64)|
| 0:01:11| You may notice Mr. Norman is not here this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=71)|
| 0:01:14| He's out of town and due to technical difficulties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=74)|
| 0:01:17| he won't be able to join us this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=77)|
| 0:01:21| This budget cycle has been very different| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=81)|
| 0:01:24| and difficult to say the least,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=84)|
| 0:01:26| and I wanted to sincerely express my gratitude| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=86)|
| 0:01:30| to fellow board members, our KCS staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=90)|
| 0:01:35| The superintendent and his team have worked very hard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=95)|
| 0:01:38| Our families, students, and community stakeholders| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=98)|
| 0:01:40| for your support and patience over the last few weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=100)|
| 0:01:43| Every effort has been made| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=103)|
| 0:01:45| to have the most accurate revenue projections| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=105)|
| 0:01:47| that were possible and every detail on this budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=107)|
| 0:01:50| for fiscal year 2021 has been reviewed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=110)|
| 0:01:53| and discussed at multiple levels and at multiple times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=113)|
| 0:01:57| We all know that this is not the budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=117)|
| 0:01:59| that we have talked about over the last year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=119)|
| 0:02:02| and we're hoping for, but we are where we are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=122)|
| 0:02:06| and we hope that things will improve quickly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=126)|
| 0:02:10| and that our 2021 school year will be concentrated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=130)|
| 0:02:13| on providing our children with the best education possible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=133)|
| 0:02:17| with whatever scenario that we're presented with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=137)|
| 0:02:21| So, do we have any changes to this agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=141)|
| 0:02:28| Okay, do we have a motion to approve?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=148)|
| 0:02:32| Okay, we have a motion by Ms. Babb,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=152)|
| 0:02:34| a second by Ms. Satterfield.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=154)|
| 0:02:36| Any discussion? All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=156)|
| 0:02:40| Any opposed? Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=160)|
| 0:02:44| Okay, and we will now have public forum. Ms. Babb.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=164)|
| 0:02:51| I'd like to call Lance McCold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=171)|
| 0:03:16| Thank you, just please state your name and county of residence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=196)|
| 0:03:18| Lance McCold, Knox County. Madam Chair, members of the board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=198)|
| 0:03:23| Mr. Thomas, thank you for allowing me to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=203)|
| 0:03:27| It's easy to get confused by budgets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=207)|
| 0:03:30| Budgets are useful, but they are fiction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=210)|
| 0:03:33| Budgets reduce people to FTEs, reduce children's needs to dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=213)|
| 0:03:38| Useful, yes, but budgets become bad when we forget the people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=218)|
| 0:03:42| especially the children they're designed to serve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=222)|
| 0:03:46| Put another way, budgets aren't about numbers or even dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=226)|
| 0:03:50| They are moral statements about our beliefs and our values.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=230)|
| 0:03:53| School budgets are statements about how much we value in our children| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=233)|
| 0:03:57| or how much we don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=237)|
| 0:03:59| This budget is about children, period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=239)|
| 0:04:02| Our schools rely on them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=242)|
| 0:04:05| The mistake we're making is thinking the only option is cuts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=245)|
| 0:04:09| It isn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=249)|
| 0:04:11| We tell ourselves that we regret we have to dismiss| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=251)|
| 0:04:14| 20 modestly paid central office staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=254)|
| 0:04:18| We regret that our already underpaid staff won't get raises| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=258)|
| 0:04:22| while having to pay more for health insurance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=262)|
| 0:04:25| We regret that we won't have new pre-K classes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=265)|
| 0:04:29| We regret that teachers will have to dig into their pockets| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=269)|
| 0:04:32| to buy basic school supplies because we won't be reimbursing schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=272)|
| 0:04:36| for fees parents can't afford.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=276)|
| 0:04:39| We regret there's no better option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=279)|
| 0:04:42| There just isn't enough money, but that's wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=282)|
| 0:04:47| There is enough money if we're willing to do the work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=287)|
| 0:04:51| What's the work?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=291)|
| 0:04:53| Asking for, fighting for the money our schools need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=293)|
| 0:04:57| so they can provide our children the education they deserve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=297)|
| 0:05:02| The problem is we've been told a lie so many times we've come to believe it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=302)|
| 0:05:06| The lie is there's no more money available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=306)|
| 0:05:10| Let me tell you why it's a lie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=310)|
| 0:05:12| Over the past 20 years, Knox County government| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=312)|
| 0:05:15| has let property taxes drop five times from $3.32 per hundred| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=315)|
| 0:05:21| to $2.12 today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=321)|
| 0:05:24| The property tax rate is $1.20 less than it was 20 years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=324)|
| 0:05:30| costing us $150 million a year in today's dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=330)|
| 0:05:35| What goes down can come up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=335)|
| 0:05:38| Every one of you agree that the state doesn't do enough| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=338)|
| 0:05:41| for our public schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=341)|
| 0:05:43| The state could do more, but right now legislators are talking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=343)|
| 0:05:46| about cutting school funding, reducing the BEP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=346)|
| 0:05:50| At the same time, some legislators are arguing not to give the $40 million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=350)|
| 0:05:55| set aside for the governor's unconstitutional voucher program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=355)|
| 0:06:01| to public schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=361)|
| 0:06:03| Even in this time of crisis, legislators are giving their pet projects| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=363)|
| 0:06:06| higher priority than our school children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=366)|
| 0:06:09| They could be persuaded to change their priorities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=369)|
| 0:06:12| Finally, federal funds are needed because state and local governments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=372)|
| 0:06:15| have to balance their budgets and the economy is in the ditch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=375)|
| 0:06:19| There are proposals to send hundreds of billions to state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=379)|
| 0:06:21| and local governments to balance their budgets without cuts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=381)|
| 0:06:25| and more to public schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=385)|
| 0:06:27| Two U.S. senators will be crucial to whether our schools have the money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=387)|
| 0:06:32| to take proper care of our children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=392)|
| 0:06:34| Ordinary citizens like me and the people out in the other room| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=394)|
| 0:06:39| are working to make available all the monies our schools need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=399)|
| 0:06:42| They're putting their puny effort into whatever they can do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=402)|
| 0:06:44| to get our children the schools they deserve despite the long odds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=404)|
| 0:06:49| As school board members, each of you has 100 times the influence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=409)|
| 0:06:53| we ordinary citizens have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=413)|
| 0:06:55| And when you speak as a board, you have 1,000 times the influence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=415)|
| 0:06:59| Here's the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=419)|
| 0:07:01| What will you do after you pass the budget?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=421)|
| 0:07:03| Will you go home and watch TV?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=423)|
| 0:07:05| Ah, it was sad, but I had to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=425)|
| 0:07:08| Or will you join the community and say, no, our children deserve more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=428)|
| 0:07:12| They deserve good, clean schools with certified teachers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=432)|
| 0:07:15| and adequate support staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=435)|
| 0:07:17| They deserve to be given priority over any politician's career.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=437)|
| 0:07:23| The struggle goes on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=443)|
| 0:07:25| Will you join the community to fight for our students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=445)|
| 0:07:27| or will you go home and tell yourself you couldn't do anything more?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=447)|
| 0:07:30| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=450)|
| 0:07:35| Carl Wheeler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=455)|
| 0:07:54| If you'll just state your name and county of residence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=474)|
| 0:07:56| My name is Carl Wheeler, resident of Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=476)|
| 0:08:01| and have been for many years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=481)|
| 0:08:03| I want to thank the board about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=483)|
| 0:08:07| When I sat out the other day and thought about this thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=487)|
| 0:08:11| I thought about why are we doing this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=491)|
| 0:08:13| And then I remembered this thing that says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=493)|
| 0:08:18| excellent education for all students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=498)|
| 0:08:22| It didn't say some.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=502)|
| 0:08:23| It didn't say this group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=503)|
| 0:08:24| It didn't say this group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=504)|
| 0:08:25| It said for all students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=505)|
| 0:08:27| So to me that means exactly that, to all students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=507)|
| 0:08:32| When we digress a little bit and go back a year or so ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=512)|
| 0:08:36| when we were here doing the same thing over again| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=516)|
| 0:08:39| and talking about the budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=519)|
| 0:08:42| somehow we ended up with a request and we got that request, which was great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=522)|
| 0:08:49| Teachers got raises and a couple other things were done, which is good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=529)|
| 0:08:53| However, here we are a year later,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=533)|
| 0:08:55| and we're talking about giving some of that back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=535)|
| 0:08:59| And how are we going to give that back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=539)|
| 0:09:01| and still have excellent educations for all of our kids?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=541)|
| 0:09:07| It's going to be a tough one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=547)|
| 0:09:08| It's going to be a tough one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=548)|
| 0:09:12| So what I propose, what I'm suggesting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=552)|
| 0:09:15| is that I saw some data about where the potential cuts were going to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=555)|
| 0:09:20| and it amounted to roughly $4.4 million that was looking to be cut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=560)|
| 0:09:26| Some of that has to do with staff members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=566)|
| 0:09:30| I saw one thing on there that struck me the most,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=570)|
| 0:09:33| and that was professional development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=573)|
| 0:09:38| You know, that's a double-edged sword| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=578)|
| 0:09:41| because that professional development that those teachers get,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=581)|
| 0:09:45| makes the teacher a better teacher for teaching those kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=585)|
| 0:09:50| So any of that that's related to what you all call public development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=590)|
| 0:09:56| excuse me, professional development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=596)|
| 0:09:58| that's a double-edged sword because the teacher becomes better| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=598)|
| 0:10:03| and therefore she's better for dealing with the students in her class, he or she.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=603)|
| 0:10:09| So those kinds of things we need to be very careful about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=609)|
| 0:10:12| when we start slicing and dicing things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=612)|
| 0:10:16| And remember that it not only affects the teachers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=616)|
| 0:10:22| in putting them in a position, if they had certain training,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=622)|
| 0:10:25| that they could effectively deal with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=625)|
| 0:10:28| But when you wipe that off, you lose two things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=628)|
| 0:10:33| You lose the knowledge and strengthening of the teacher| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=633)|
| 0:10:37| and you lose the students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=637)|
| 0:10:39| because they don't get the opportunity to respond accordingly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=639)|
| 0:10:48| In my opinion, and I've said this before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=648)|
| 0:10:52| the school board should develop a budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=652)|
| 0:10:56| in regards to what the bottom line is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=656)|
| 0:10:59| what they need to do the job to deliver excellent education for all kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=659)|
| 0:11:06| We need to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=666)|
| 0:11:07| We need to focus on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=667)|
| 0:11:09| And here we are this year talking about giving $4.4 million back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=669)|
| 0:11:17| So I did a little research in the last three or four days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=677)|
| 0:11:19| and I found that there are a number of organizations in the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=679)|
| 0:11:23| that put together their part of the budget and it goes in and gets massaged.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=683)|
| 0:11:28| You've got the police, the sheriff, you've got the school board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=688)|
| 0:11:35| you have the individuals in the library.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=695)|
| 0:11:45| You have a number of groups that put together their individual budgets| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=705)|
| 0:11:48| that go into making a big budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=708)|
| 0:11:52| And then we ended up with a Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=712)|
| 0:11:58| what's called a Knox County fund balance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=718)|
| 0:12:02| And according to what I pulled off the web the other day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=722)|
| 0:12:04| there's $54 million there, $54 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=724)|
| 0:12:10| And on the other side of the table over here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=730)|
| 0:12:12| the teachers are asked to give up $4.4 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=732)|
| 0:12:17| What are we saving that money for?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=737)|
| 0:12:20| How long have we been saving that money?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=740)|
| 0:12:24| It's time that that money should be given, in this case,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=744)|
| 0:12:28| to the school board, that $4.4 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=748)|
| 0:12:32| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=752)|
| 0:12:33| All right, thank you for this time to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=753)|
| 0:12:35| And I hope you consider all that you will hear from us today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=755)|
| 0:12:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=759)|
| 0:12:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=760)|
| 0:12:43| That concludes public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=763)|
| 0:12:45| Thank you, Ms. Babb.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=765)|
| 0:12:47| Superintendent Thomas, would you like to open us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=767)|
| 0:12:50| and review the highlights and take it away?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=770)|
| 0:12:54| Yes, ma'am, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=774)|
| 0:12:55| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=775)|
| 0:12:56| And members of the board, thank you for this opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=776)|
| 0:12:59| First, I'd like to take just a moment to thank our families| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=779)|
| 0:13:02| for their support and patience as we've attempted to navigate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=782)|
| 0:13:05| the last couple of months of this pandemic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=785)|
| 0:13:07| We know it's been frustrating, frustrating for everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=787)|
| 0:13:11| I'm confident that our one-to-one initiative,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=791)|
| 0:13:13| which the board approved earlier this month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=793)|
| 0:13:15| will help us be prepared for whatever lies ahead in the fall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=795)|
| 0:13:18| We weren't prepared in the spring at school closure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=798)|
| 0:13:20| but we will be prepared upon school opening| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=800)|
| 0:13:23| here in the next several weeks, provided we have a normal opening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=803)|
| 0:13:27| If we don't have a normal opening, we'll be prepared for that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=807)|
| 0:13:30| So I'm very pleased to report that the County Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=810)|
| 0:13:33| approved our technology purchase at their meeting yesterday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=813)|
| 0:13:36| We've already placed an order for approximately 40,000 devices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=816)|
| 0:13:41| So those are scheduled to be delivered about mid-July.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=821)|
| 0:13:45| So, again, just very grateful to you, the board members,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=825)|
| 0:13:48| and to the County Commission for approving this initiative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=828)|
| 0:13:51| to allow us to be ready and to kind of get an early start.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=831)|
| 0:13:54| I can't imagine if we were a month later and getting the devices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=834)|
| 0:13:58| So we'll be ready.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=838)|
| 0:14:00| Next, I'd also like to recognize the tremendous effort of our staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=840)|
| 0:14:03| during this difficult time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=843)|
| 0:14:05| They've stepped up in so many ways, and I could not be prouder| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=845)|
| 0:14:08| of their commitment to our students and to their work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=848)|
| 0:14:11| Our school nutrition workers prepared over 834,000 meals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=851)|
| 0:14:16| I think Ms. Foster, I don't know if she's with us here tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=856)|
| 0:14:19| but I believe they were looking at maybe over 10,000 hours or so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=859)|
| 0:14:23| that our child nutrition workers have worked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=863)|
| 0:14:26| So that's just incredible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=866)|
| 0:14:28| And just kudos to you, Brett, and to your staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=868)|
| 0:14:31| for all the hard work that you've done for our students at home| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=871)|
| 0:14:35| and prepare instructional packets for our students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=875)|
| 0:14:38| Next week, our C&I team will be launching KCS Summer at Home| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=878)|
| 0:14:42| for students who desire learning opportunities over the summer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=882)|
| 0:14:46| We have all been trying to adjust under these conditions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=886)|
| 0:14:48| and this has proven to be particularly challenging| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=888)|
| 0:14:51| as we have been preparing for the FY21 budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=891)|
| 0:14:54| We have spent untold hours reviewing our expenditures| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=894)|
| 0:14:57| and financial projections,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=897)|
| 0:14:59| and as you are aware, the outlook is grim.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=899)|
| 0:15:02| We are facing a $20 million projected revenue shortfall,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=902)|
| 0:15:07| and we're balancing a budget with less revenue than the current year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=907)|
| 0:15:11| I happen to look back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=911)|
| 0:15:13| The last time that happened was fiscal year 1992,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=913)|
| 0:15:16| and I look at this fortunately or unfortunately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=916)|
| 0:15:19| I've been here both times,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=919)|
| 0:15:21| and I hope I don't have to again the second time this happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=921)|
| 0:15:25| So having less revenue than the prior year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=925)|
| 0:15:27| plus having fixed increases makes this budget extremely challenging.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=927)|
| 0:15:31| Regrettably, we've had to face some tough decisions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=931)|
| 0:15:34| none of which I'm happy about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=934)|
| 0:15:37| We know the budget proposal before you does not meet all of our needs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=937)|
| 0:15:40| and is very disappointing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=940)|
| 0:15:42| Unlike previous years, we will not be able to provide our employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=942)|
| 0:15:45| with an across-the-board percentage salary increase,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=945)|
| 0:15:49| nor are there sufficient dollars to address| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=949)|
| 0:15:51| the English Language Arts textbook adoption| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=951)|
| 0:15:54| or to enhance RTI services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=954)|
| 0:15:57| or to provide additional mental, emotional, and social health supports| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=957)|
| 0:16:01| for our students as planned prior to COVID-19.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=961)|
| 0:16:05| Given all that is not desirable about this budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=965)|
| 0:16:09| we believe we've developed a budget that's manageable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=969)|
| 0:16:12| one that we can afford given the current revenue projections,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=972)|
| 0:16:15| and one that will allow us to continue to serve our students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=975)|
| 0:16:19| As we have stated previously, we've made every effort| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=979)|
| 0:16:22| to avoid significant cuts to the classroom| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=982)|
| 0:16:24| and minimize the loss of positions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=984)|
| 0:16:26| However, cuts had to be made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=986)|
| 0:16:29| And let me repeat, cuts had to be made in order to balance this budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=989)|
| 0:16:33| And I can assure you that none of us liked the recommended cuts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=993)|
| 0:16:36| We reduced our budget by over $10 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=996)|
| 0:16:39| Looking for the last $4.4 million to cut was no enviable task.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=999)|
| 0:16:44| However, I commend our staff for their hard work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=1004)|
| 0:16:47| Untold hours have been spent by our finance staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=1007)|
| 0:16:50| and leadership team in preparing this budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=1010)|
| 0:16:53| As I mentioned earlier, there are several reductions in this budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=1013)|
| 0:16:56| that are disheartening, such as, to name a few,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=1016)|
| 0:16:59| implementing a temporary five-day reduction for our 12-month employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=1019)|
| 0:17:03| We've got, I think, 270 or so, no, 370 or so, I believe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=1023)|
| 0:17:10| 255-day employees, 12-month employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=1030)|
| 0:17:13| And the savings there is about $700,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=1033)|
| 0:17:17| So just to put that in terms, if you were looking at positions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=1037)|
| 0:17:21| that would fund about 10.5 teaching positions, 22.5 EA positions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=1041)|
| 0:17:26| 21 custodial positions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=1046)|
| 0:17:28| Also would provide the step increases for 735 certified employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=1048)|
| 0:17:37| So just to put it in perspective, what $700,000 would do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=1057)|
| 0:17:41| So, again, I commend our employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=1061)|
| 0:17:44| Hopefully this is just a one-year furlough of five days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=1064)|
| 0:17:47| but I just commend our employees for being willing to sacrifice their day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=1067)|
| 0:17:53| so that we can do more with this budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=1073)|
| 0:17:56| Also eliminating the employer cost sharing for health insurance premium increases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=1076)|
| 0:18:01| Also reducing central office and system-wide support personnel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=1081)|
| 0:18:05| And then decreasing allocations and fee waivers across all schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=1085)|
| 0:18:09| Again, these are all undesirable ways that we utilize in order to balance this budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=1089)|
| 0:18:16| Even with the cuts that are recommended,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=1096)|
| 0:18:18| I'm very proud that we are preserving step increases| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=1098)|
| 0:18:21| for eligible certified and classified employees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=1101)|
| 0:18:24| keeping our current teacher-pupil ratios in all schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=1104)|
| 0:18:28| continuing to pay our teachers who are on extended contract the coming school year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=1108)|
| 0:18:33| maintaining several capital priorities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=1113)|
| 0:18:35| including a new elementary school for Adrian Burnett Elementary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=1115)|
| 0:18:38| a new elementary school for Lonsdale,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=1118)|
| 0:18:40| and a new elementary school in northwest Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=1120)|
| 0:18:44| Finally, and perhaps the most exciting initiative for this next year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=1124)|
| 0:18:48| is that KCS will become a one-to-one district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=1128)|
| 0:18:50| So, again, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=1130)|
| 0:18:52| It is my hope that the pandemic's impact is less severe than projected| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=1132)|
| 0:18:56| and the economy will rebound to pre-COVID levels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=1136)|
| 0:18:59| Nevertheless, we're all making sacrifices| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=1139)|
| 0:19:01| and we will remain committed to our mission of serving students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=1141)|
| 0:19:04| In closing, I respectfully request your consideration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=1144)|
| 0:19:07| of this budget recommendation of $503,847,000 for fiscal year 21.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=1147)|
| 0:19:13| And at this time, I'd like to call on Mr. Ron McPherson,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=1153)|
| 0:19:16| our Assistant Superintendent and Chief Financial Officer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=1156)|
| 0:19:19| to go over a few slides with you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=1159)|
| 0:19:22| and then we will turn it back over to you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=1162)|
| 0:19:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=1165)|
| 0:19:26| Thank you, Mr. Superintendent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=1166)|
| 0:19:29| Well, thank you, Mr. Thomas, Madam Chair, members of the Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=1169)|
| 0:19:32| I almost feel like we need to bow again for a word of prayer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=1172)|
| 0:19:35| before we go through this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=1175)|
| 0:19:37| I do want to thank Joe Snyder and Joni Joyce.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=1177)|
| 0:19:41| Joe is our Budget Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=1181)|
| 0:19:43| Joni is our Financial Analyst.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=1183)|
| 0:19:46| This was the most challenging budget I can ever remember.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=1186)|
| 0:19:50| They do a great job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=1190)|
| 0:19:52| You can imagine that we have run a number of scenarios| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=1192)|
| 0:19:56| over the last couple of months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=1196)|
| 0:19:58| Multiple budget projections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=1198)|
| 0:20:01| We went deeply into the weeds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=1201)|
| 0:20:05| and they are just fantastic to be able to produce the information we need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=1205)|
| 0:20:10| as we work through this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=1210)|
| 0:20:14| I do have a few slides that I think summarize| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=1214)|
| 0:20:19| how we got to this budget proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=1219)|
| 0:20:22| Let me make sure I can...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=1222)|
| 0:20:25| Oh, let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=1225)|
| 0:20:26| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=1226)|
| 0:20:27| There we go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=1227)|
| 0:20:28| First off, obviously the pandemic has required us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=1228)|
| 0:20:33| to significantly reduce sales tax revenue projections,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=1233)|
| 0:20:39| which has dramatically impacted this budget, as you can imagine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=1239)|
| 0:20:42| A third of our budget, almost a third of our budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=1242)|
| 0:20:45| is funded from sales tax revenue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=1245)|
| 0:20:48| and so when consumer spending is significantly down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=1248)|
| 0:20:52| it obviously places a tremendous stress on our budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=1252)|
| 0:20:57| So I think it's helpful to see where we have come from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=1257)|
| 0:21:02| just over the last couple of months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=1262)|
| 0:21:05| So how we arrived at where we are now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=1265)|
| 0:21:10| it looks dramatically different than what it did two months ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=1270)|
| 0:21:14| Now, I will say that in March, February, March,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=1274)|
| 0:21:20| as we were rolling right along,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=1280)|
| 0:21:22| we were developing a budget under the assumption| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=1282)|
| 0:21:25| that revenue would continue to grow at a relatively normal pace,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=1285)|
| 0:21:29| and so we were actually trending to even have a surplus| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=1289)|
| 0:21:33| for this fiscal year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=1293)|
| 0:21:35| and so there was every reason to believe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=1295)|
| 0:21:37| that that would continue into the next fiscal year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=1297)|
| 0:21:39| and that trajectory would continue along the same path.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=1299)|
| 0:21:44| And while we were still a little ways off| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=1304)|
| 0:21:49| from balancing to having a balanced budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=1309)|
| 0:21:53| there were some initiatives, or quite a few initiatives,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=1313)|
| 0:21:56| we felt like we could do with some work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=1316)|
| 0:21:58| to make this budget work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=1318)|
| 0:22:00| And so then the pandemic hit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=1320)|
| 0:22:03| and then suddenly everything changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=1323)|
| 0:22:07| In working with the county, with county officials,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=1327)|
| 0:22:10| with state officials,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=1330)|
| 0:22:12| we've read about anything we could get our hands on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=1332)|
| 0:22:16| and we've looked at the predictions of national economists,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=1336)|
| 0:22:21| and so we arrived at the numbers there in the middle column.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=1341)|
| 0:22:26| I will say that these are only estimates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=1346)|
| 0:22:30| Please keep that in mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=1350)|
| 0:22:32| We really can't predict the unknown| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=1352)|
| 0:22:35| with any degree of precision, I will say it that way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=1355)|
| 0:22:40| that we feel comfortable with, necessarily,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=1360)|
| 0:22:43| because the state and the country| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=1363)|
| 0:22:46| finds itself in a very precarious position| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=1366)|
| 0:22:50| of trying to determine what this thing's going to look like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=1370)|
| 0:22:52| as it plays out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=1372)|
| 0:22:54| So I will say that I hope this doesn't happen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=1374)|
| 0:22:57| but if revenue projections come in significantly less| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=1377)|
| 0:23:03| than what we're even predicting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=1383)|
| 0:23:07| we may find ourselves back again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=1387)|
| 0:23:09| having to modify the budget more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=1389)|
| 0:23:11| We certainly hope that doesn't happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=1391)|
| 0:23:12| We're not predicting that happens,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=1392)|
| 0:23:14| but we just don't know what the future holds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=1394)|
| 0:23:16| So we've done the best we can,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=1396)|
| 0:23:18| looking at a variety of sources to try to land on these numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=1398)|
| 0:23:23| So let's talk about the projected increases,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=1403)|
| 0:23:27| or decreases, if you will,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=1407)|
| 0:23:30| of the major components of revenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=1410)|
| 0:23:32| So you'll see the first one there, state revenue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=1412)|
| 0:23:36| $10.6 million in March.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=1416)|
| 0:23:39| We were estimating somewhere around an increase| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=1419)|
| 0:23:42| of something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=1422)|
| 0:23:45| And then, of course, the pandemic hit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=1425)|
| 0:23:49| and we're now down to 8.8.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=1429)|
| 0:23:52| Now, that is based on the most recent information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=1432)|
| 0:23:55| that we have received from the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=1435)|
| 0:23:59| I will say there is some kind of education| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=1439)|
| 0:24:01| that this revenue number is relatively stable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=1441)|
| 0:24:05| So that's what we're hoping for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=1445)|
| 0:24:07| That's what we're banking on right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=1447)|
| 0:24:08| But it reflects an $8.8 million increase| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=1448)|
| 0:24:11| from budget to budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=1451)|
| 0:24:13| and that, again, is based on information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=1453)|
| 0:24:14| we received just last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=1454)|
| 0:24:16| So we are continuing to be assured| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=1456)|
| 0:24:18| that there should not be significant fluctuations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=1458)|
| 0:24:21| with this number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=1461)|
| 0:24:23| Property taxes, we had programmed in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=1463)|
| 0:24:26| a modest increase of $1.5 million initially.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=1466)|
| 0:24:31| Now, with COVID, we have backed off of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=1471)|
| 0:24:34| and we're just essentially going with a flat budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=1474)|
| 0:24:37| And this is based on discussions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=1477)|
| 0:24:38| we've had with the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=1478)|
| 0:24:40| So for conservative purposes, that has been backed down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=1480)|
| 0:24:42| I can tell you that preliminary indications| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=1482)|
| 0:24:45| are that property tax collections| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=1485)|
| 0:24:49| are coming in a little slower than normal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=1489)|
| 0:24:54| So we are seeing some effects of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=1494)|
| 0:24:58| We don't know why.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=1498)|
| 0:25:00| There are some assumptions here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=1500)|
| 0:25:02| Maybe folks are just simply not paying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=1502)|
| 0:25:03| Maybe it's because a lot of places have been closed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=1503)|
| 0:25:06| and there's just no one to send in the escrow payments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=1506)|
| 0:25:08| I mean, we just don't know yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=1508)|
| 0:25:10| But for conservative purposes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=1510)|
| 0:25:11| we have backed that down to a flat budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=1511)|
| 0:25:14| We hope that doesn't have to come down even more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=1514)|
| 0:25:17| as the year progresses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=1517)|
| 0:25:19| A bit of good news there in the next item,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=1519)|
| 0:25:21| other miscellaneous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=1521)|
| 0:25:23| We have a $1 million swing there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=1523)|
| 0:25:26| and I can tell you that what has happened| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=1526)|
| 0:25:28| over the last couple of months,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=1528)|
| 0:25:30| this is one of the good news piece for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=1530)|
| 0:25:35| We haven't had a lot of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=1535)|
| 0:25:36| So the indirect cost rate on federal grants has increased.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=1536)|
| 0:25:41| This allows us to charge a bit more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=1541)|
| 0:25:43| for administration of those grants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=1543)|
| 0:25:45| Now, the downside is that it's coming out of the grant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=1545)|
| 0:25:49| The good side is that it's going into the general purpose budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=1549)|
| 0:25:52| because it's allowable cost,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=1552)|
| 0:25:54| so it's helping our general purpose close the gap some.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=1554)|
| 0:25:58| So we did make up a little bit of ground there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=1558)|
| 0:26:01| but not nearly enough to overcome the next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=1561)|
| 0:26:04| And this is the real culprit that we've all talked about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=1564)|
| 0:26:07| This is the real problem, sales tax revenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=1567)|
| 0:26:11| In the last two months,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=1571)|
| 0:26:14| you can see this has been an $18 million swing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=1574)|
| 0:26:17| from almost a $10 million increase projected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=1577)|
| 0:26:21| Again, that was on that trajectory| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=1581)|
| 0:26:23| that we were seeing based on trend levels prior to COVID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=1583)|
| 0:26:27| Now, we're showing an $8.5 million decrease.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=1587)|
| 0:26:31| So you can see that has shifted $18 million there in our assumption.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=1591)|
| 0:26:36| So that is the biggest factor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=1596)|
| 0:26:41| that has kind of thrown this budget into disarray, if you will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=1601)|
| 0:26:45| So it's a reduction of just over $20 million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=1605)|
| 0:26:49| in the span of two months,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=1609)|
| 0:26:51| projecting $528.3 million going into the next year's budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=1611)|
| 0:26:56| down to $507.8 million,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=1616)|
| 0:26:59| so a $20 million swing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=1619)|
| 0:27:05| So this is a slide here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=1625)|
| 0:27:08| that's just a visual of kind of what we just got through discussing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=1628)|
| 0:27:12| So the green line is prior to COVID,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=1632)|
| 0:27:14| and you can see that the BEP,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=1634)|
| 0:27:18| we had projected about a $10 million increase| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=1638)|
| 0:27:21| and then a $1.5 million increase for property taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=1641)|
| 0:27:25| Then a little bit of a decrease in the miscellaneous items,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=1645)|
| 0:27:28| and then a really large uptick in sales tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=1648)|
| 0:27:33| The red line is where we find ourselves at now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=1653)|
| 0:27:37| So there is, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=1657)|
| 0:27:40| some dollar increases in state BEP, $8.8 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=1660)|
| 0:27:44| A little bit off, but not unmanageable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=1664)|
| 0:27:47| Property taxes, flat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=1667)|
| 0:27:49| Again, not unmanageable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=1669)|
| 0:27:51| A little bit of a gain in miscellaneous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=1671)|
| 0:27:53| So if you look at just those three components,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=1673)|
| 0:27:56| you know, maybe we can make this thing work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=1676)|
| 0:27:59| But then you can see the huge difference| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=1679)|
| 0:28:02| where property tax originally was projected to go up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=1682)|
| 0:28:07| at almost $10 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=1687)|
| 0:28:09| It's coming down about $9 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=1689)|
| 0:28:11| So that's that huge gap that we find ourselves having to make up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=1691)|
| 0:28:18| So let's talk about, kind of give a summary here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=1698)|
| 0:28:22| of sources of funds and uses of funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=1702)|
| 0:28:26| So our estimated revenue is $5.7.8 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=1706)|
| 0:28:32| Now, we have put an item there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=1712)|
| 0:28:36| we've called it replenished fund balance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=1716)|
| 0:28:38| And so what is happening there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=1718)|
| 0:28:40| this is due to anticipated revenue shortfalls| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=1720)|
| 0:28:43| in the current fiscal year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=1723)|
| 0:28:45| We fear that we will have to go into fund balance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=1725)|
| 0:28:51| throughout the remainder of this fiscal year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=1731)|
| 0:28:54| that will take us below the 3% mark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=1734)|
| 0:28:58| When that happens, we are required to then budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=1738)|
| 0:29:02| literally budget our savings, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=1742)|
| 0:29:05| So that's our rainy day fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=1745)|
| 0:29:08| And so that is ultimately $4 million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=1748)|
| 0:29:11| that we can't use for educational initiatives| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=1751)|
| 0:29:13| because we're trying to replenish fund balance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=1753)|
| 0:29:15| So, you know, while the downside is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=1755)|
| 0:29:18| this is a requirement from the state,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=1758)|
| 0:29:20| and in effect it's a budget cut,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=1760)|
| 0:29:23| the good thing is that to be financially responsible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=1763)|
| 0:29:26| it probably is the right thing to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=1766)|
| 0:29:28| Because when we talk about fund balance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=1768)|
| 0:29:30| a lot of times it looks just like a number,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=1770)|
| 0:29:32| but it really is cash reserves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=1772)|
| 0:29:33| It's real cash.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=1773)|
| 0:29:35| So that's why we have to be very careful to keep a level up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=1775)|
| 0:29:39| to maintain our fund balance to a reasonably healthy level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=1779)|
| 0:29:43| So using that assumption, that brings our available revenue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=1783)|
| 0:29:46| down to $503.8 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=1786)|
| 0:29:49| So you'll notice the green arrow going down there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=1789)|
| 0:29:52| to the preliminary budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=1792)|
| 0:29:54| That's what we have to work with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=1794)|
| 0:29:56| Now, you can see that...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=1796)|
| 0:29:59| Well, let me pause here for a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=1799)|
| 0:30:02| The dilemma we're having with trying to predict fund balance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=1802)|
| 0:30:05| is that we really don't know and won't know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=1805)|
| 0:30:09| the impact of COVID on the economy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=1809)|
| 0:30:11| for a couple of more months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=1811)|
| 0:30:13| Sales tax, there's a two-month lag time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=1813)|
| 0:30:16| We don't get that data in real time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=1816)|
| 0:30:18| So sales tax collections happen across the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=1818)|
| 0:30:22| They're sent to Nashville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=1822)|
| 0:30:25| Those are calculated back to the local option portion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=1825)|
| 0:30:28| that goes back to the counties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=1828)|
| 0:30:31| They send those back, and then the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=1831)|
| 0:30:34| then posts the information and the data becomes available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=1834)|
| 0:30:38| So that's about a two-month process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=1838)|
| 0:30:40| So what makes this budget particularly challenging| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=1840)|
| 0:30:43| is we're having to develop it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=1843)|
| 0:30:46| under a large number of assumptions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=1846)|
| 0:30:50| So we're based, again, once again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=1850)|
| 0:30:54| we base this on a number of sources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=1854)|
| 0:30:56| This is our best shot at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=1856)|
| 0:30:58| So we really won't know the degree that COVID has had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=1858)|
| 0:31:01| on this year's budget, which affects fund balance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=1861)|
| 0:31:05| which affects next year's budget, until probably August.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=1865)|
| 0:31:09| So we're already into the school year when we know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=1869)|
| 0:31:12| Now we're pressing in on the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=1872)|
| 0:31:14| Chris Caldwell and his team does a fantastic job| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=1874)|
| 0:31:16| trying to get information from the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=1876)|
| 0:31:18| But you still have to use a lot of assumptions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=1878)|
| 0:31:20| The state can give us total numbers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=1880)|
| 0:31:23| but you still have to try to figure out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=1883)|
| 0:31:25| what that means for your district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=1885)|
| 0:31:27| So anyway, there's a two-month turnaround on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=1887)|
| 0:31:32| So we estimate having $503.8 million available to spend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=1892)|
| 0:31:38| Now you'll notice the 2020 approved budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=1898)|
| 0:31:40| this is under uses of funding, is $506.7 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=1900)|
| 0:31:44| So you can see right out of the gate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=1904)|
| 0:31:48| that we've got a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=1908)|
| 0:31:50| We have less projected revenue available for spending| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=1910)|
| 0:31:54| than the current year budget that we're operating in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=1914)|
| 0:31:58| So before we do anything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=1918)|
| 0:32:00| before we make any additions to this budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=1920)|
| 0:32:02| we're in a position of where we have to cut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=1922)|
| 0:32:05| When we add step increases, as Mr. Thomas talked about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=1925)|
| 0:32:10| we're planning to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=1930)|
| 0:32:12| That's our recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=1932)|
| 0:32:14| It includes for both certified and classified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=1934)|
| 0:32:17| When we do that and then when we roll on fixed increases,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=1937)|
| 0:32:20| and these are items that we really don't have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=1940)|
| 0:32:22| a lot of flexibility on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=1942)|
| 0:32:25| then suddenly the gap grows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=1945)|
| 0:32:27| And now we're faced with having to go in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=1947)|
| 0:32:30| and identify over $10 million of reductions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=1950)|
| 0:32:33| that the superintendent talked about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=1953)|
| 0:32:36| Our strategy to do that is through a combination of things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=1956)|
| 0:32:40| and we're going to talk about those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=1960)|
| 0:32:42| in a little bit more detail on the next slide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=1962)|
| 0:32:44| But there's a combination of budgetary savings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=1964)|
| 0:32:47| reallocations, and cuts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=1967)|
| 0:32:49| So there has, you know, in the media,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=1969)|
| 0:32:54| they've talked about budget cuts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=1974)|
| 0:32:56| because that's how we've phrased it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=1976)|
| 0:32:58| These are actual cuts into the base budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=1978)|
| 0:33:01| But in reality, it's an over $10 million reduction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=1981)|
| 0:33:04| when you roll in the reallocations and the savings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=1984)|
| 0:33:07| because that's what we had to get down to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=1987)|
| 0:33:09| based on the available funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=1989)|
| 0:33:12| Also, this doesn't even speak| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=1992)|
| 0:33:14| to some of the very critical initiatives| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=1994)|
| 0:33:17| that won't get funded,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=1997)|
| 0:33:19| and Mr. Thomas has talked about those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=1999)|
| 0:33:21| Those were items in March that we felt pretty good about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=2001)|
| 0:33:24| that we were working towards to get those in the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=2004)|
| 0:33:27| Those things, unfortunately, now are off the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=2007)|
| 0:33:31| So let me go to the next slide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=2011)|
| 0:33:33| This is just a visual where we increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=2013)|
| 0:33:37| You can see the green. Those are increases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=2017)|
| 0:33:39| The reds are the decreases of how we had to get back down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=2019)|
| 0:33:44| how we had to work the budget back down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=2024)|
| 0:33:45| So if you start at this base level,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=2025)|
| 0:33:47| step increases add $4 million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=2027)|
| 0:33:49| and another $3.5 million of fixed increases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=2029)|
| 0:33:52| But then you have to work it back down to a balanced scenario| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=2032)|
| 0:33:55| so you have the savings there, the reallocations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=2035)|
| 0:33:58| and the cuts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=2038)|
| 0:34:03| Let's go on to the last slide here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=2043)|
| 0:34:07| This gives us a bit more detail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=2047)|
| 0:34:09| We talked about step increases for certified| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=2049)|
| 0:34:12| and classified employees, $4 million there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=2052)|
| 0:34:15| with fixed increases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=2055)|
| 0:34:18| Again, this is an area we just don't have a lot of flexibility with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=2058)|
| 0:34:22| The two biggest items you'll notice there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=2062)|
| 0:34:24| are added positions and health insurance costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=2064)|
| 0:34:27| This current year and the year we're in now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=2067)|
| 0:34:29| earlier in the year we added 29 positions that were unbudgeted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=2069)|
| 0:34:34| This is not unusual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=2074)|
| 0:34:36| We have issues with BEP at times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=2076)|
| 0:34:39| We staff pretty tightly at some of our elementary schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=2079)|
| 0:34:43| and then so when kids come in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=2083)|
| 0:34:46| so as not to be in violation of BEP,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=2086)|
| 0:34:49| we're at times forced to hire a position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=2089)|
| 0:34:51| Most of this, though, relates to special education positions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=2091)|
| 0:34:56| and teacher's assistance, IEP requirements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=2096)|
| 0:34:59| so the law that we have to meet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=2099)|
| 0:35:01| There are some other positions here, ELL positions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=2101)|
| 0:35:04| There is a requirement that we staff at a certain ratio.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=2104)|
| 0:35:07| These are some things we just don't have a lot of choice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=2107)|
| 0:35:10| We've also added some nurse positions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=2110)|
| 0:35:13| These are things that come along.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=2113)|
| 0:35:15| You hope these types of needs are not significant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=2115)|
| 0:35:20| after you've passed the budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=2120)|
| 0:35:22| but they are positions we added that were not budgeted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=2122)|
| 0:35:25| and obviously we have to budget for them this year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=2125)|
| 0:35:27| so that's $1.5 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=2127)|
| 0:35:30| Health insurance, $1.4 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=2130)|
| 0:35:32| We have more folks on the health plan this year than at this time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=2132)|
| 0:35:39| or now, than we did last year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=2139)|
| 0:35:41| and so obviously there is an employer cost that comes with that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=2141)|
| 0:35:44| and that's about $1.4 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=2144)|
| 0:35:47| I will tell you there is a premium increase| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=2147)|
| 0:35:50| that the state is telling us about that we think now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=2150)|
| 0:35:55| based on the latest information, it's going to be a 2%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=2155)|
| 0:35:58| Originally we were hearing things like 5% to 7%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=2158)|
| 0:36:01| I can tell you there, unfortunately, is not any dollars budgeted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=2161)|
| 0:36:05| to help with the increase,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=2165)|
| 0:36:09| so this would pretty much just keep that standard dollar amount| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=2169)|
| 0:36:13| for each plan static,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=2173)|
| 0:36:15| so the $1.4 million addition there you see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=2175)|
| 0:36:17| relates strictly to additional participants on the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=2177)|
| 0:36:21| Now, this premium increase will not be coming to effect until December.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=2181)|
| 0:36:27| We do have some time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=2187)|
| 0:36:29| What we will do is we hope for the best,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=2189)|
| 0:36:32| that revenue comes in better than what we thought,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=2192)|
| 0:36:35| so we can revisit this item,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=2195)|
| 0:36:37| but it looks like if we can pull this off between now and December,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=2197)|
| 0:36:42| the lift is not as heavy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=2202)|
| 0:36:44| so we were thinking originally it may be a million dollars or more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=2204)|
| 0:36:47| based on a 5% to 7% increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=2207)|
| 0:36:49| We're now thinking it's probably closer to $200,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=2209)|
| 0:36:51| so the lift is not as big,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=2211)|
| 0:36:53| so we remain hopeful there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=2213)|
| 0:36:55| but at the moment there's no dollars for just that increased portion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=2215)|
| 0:37:00| I think there was some confusion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=2220)|
| 0:37:02| Folks have heard that, oh, we're not funding health insurance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=2222)|
| 0:37:05| Yes, we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=2225)|
| 0:37:07| It's just that portion of the increase that we don't have dollars for yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=2227)|
| 0:37:12| The final two items there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=2232)|
| 0:37:14| the closed retirement plan and property insurance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=2234)|
| 0:37:17| The closed retirement plan is that is so depending on the actuarial valuation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=2237)|
| 0:37:24| that's the dollars that we put into that plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=2244)|
| 0:37:27| so it's going to cost a little bit more this year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=2247)|
| 0:37:30| and then property insurance rates have gone up some,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=2250)|
| 0:37:32| so that rounds out the fixed increases, $3.5 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=2252)|
| 0:37:36| So now we're faced with, to get down to available revenue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=2256)|
| 0:37:39| we're faced with trying to identify over $10 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=2259)|
| 0:37:42| Again, we've done that in three different ways,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=2262)|
| 0:37:44| savings, reallocations, and cuts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=2264)|
| 0:37:46| So let's talk about the savings first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=2266)|
| 0:37:49| We were able to identify $4.9 million of savings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=2269)|
| 0:37:52| A large part of that is a result of a debt restructure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=2272)|
| 0:37:56| We've worked with the county on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=2276)|
| 0:37:58| and so we have rearranged some of the debt payments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=2278)|
| 0:38:02| that will allow us to save about $2 million this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=2282)|
| 0:38:07| Debt payments, this is associated with our capital improvement plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=2287)|
| 0:38:10| As you know, we do have to fund some of our capital improvement dollars,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=2290)|
| 0:38:15| the debt associated with that, in the general purpose budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=2295)|
| 0:38:19| A good portion of that, of our debt, is funded through the debt service fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=2299)|
| 0:38:25| That's a fund that services the debt of both the county and the school system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=2305)|
| 0:38:30| The problem is it's a debt service fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=2310)|
| 0:38:32| There is not sufficient dollars in there to cover our total debt obligations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=2312)|
| 0:38:36| and so we have to cover that additional amount in the general purpose budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=2316)|
| 0:38:39| So that's what this amount is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=2319)|
| 0:38:41| But we do have some savings there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=2321)|
| 0:38:43| The next item, we do have actually some cost savings with TCRS.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=2323)|
| 0:38:48| I think the employer portion has went down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=2328)|
| 0:38:52| Is that right, Joe? Is that what happened?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=2332)|
| 0:38:53| The employer rate has come down a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=2333)|
| 0:38:56| We don't know what, in future years, what the pandemic will do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=2336)|
| 0:39:00| I remember that this was a pretty static number for a while,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=2340)|
| 0:39:04| but then the recession hit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=2344)|
| 0:39:06| When we started coming out of the recession, that number blew up on us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=2346)|
| 0:39:11| and it was a gigantic hit to the budget one year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=2351)|
| 0:39:14| So we hope that doesn't happen again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=2354)|
| 0:39:16| But for the moment, there is a little bit of a reduction here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=2356)|
| 0:39:19| and obviously we'll take advantage of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=2359)|
| 0:39:22| Workers' compensation, a reduction there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=2362)|
| 0:39:25| This is due to our continued implementation of safety measures and training,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=2365)|
| 0:39:31| so that continues to pay some dividends there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=2371)|
| 0:39:33| A reduction in charter school pass-through dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=2373)|
| 0:39:36| As you know, we pass public dollars through to the charter school on a per-pupil basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=2376)|
| 0:39:42| So whatever that average per-pupil cost is for Knox County with regards to the BEP,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=2382)|
| 0:39:46| we receive in property tax and sales tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=2386)|
| 0:39:49| We pass along a proportional share to the charter school based on their enrollment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=2389)|
| 0:39:54| So for this year, that projected enrollment is down from the previous year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=2394)|
| 0:40:01| So we do have some savings there, and we've talked with the folks there at Emerald,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=2401)|
| 0:40:07| and we think this is a pretty good number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=2407)|
| 0:40:08| So we think this is good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=2408)|
| 0:40:11| We have less in sick leave payments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=2411)|
| 0:40:14| These are the sick leave payments we grant upon retirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=2414)|
| 0:40:19| We're going to have some savings here, we think, this year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=2419)|
| 0:40:21| because you'll remember we offered the early retirement incentive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=2421)|
| 0:40:24| so we had more folks retiring from the past year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=2424)|
| 0:40:28| So we anticipate we're going to have less than that this year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=2428)|
| 0:40:32| and so that's going to provide some anticipated savings for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=2432)|
| 0:40:35| Another item there, central office relocation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=2435)|
| 0:40:39| I know everyone on the board is keenly familiar with this item| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=2439)|
| 0:40:44| because it was discussed at length for months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=2444)|
| 0:40:47| So originally we were thinking it was going to be more like about a $700,000 savings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=2447)|
| 0:40:52| That was based on an annual savings amount.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=2452)|
| 0:40:54| Obviously we're not going to be able to move July 1, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=2454)|
| 0:40:59| So there's some factors, obviously, here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=2459)|
| 0:41:02| The pandemic certainly hasn't helped.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=2462)|
| 0:41:04| What we're assuming is like a midyear move.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=2464)|
| 0:41:07| If so, that gives us about half of the savings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=2467)|
| 0:41:10| So that may actually be a bit optimistic, but that's what we're shooting for anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=2470)|
| 0:41:17| And then we have some savings in the transportation department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=2477)|
| 0:41:20| We have some lower anticipated equipment repair costs and also lower fuel costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=2480)|
| 0:41:26| And then we have, we just put another item there, about $200,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=2486)|
| 0:41:30| This is various savings throughout the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=2490)|
| 0:41:36| So anyway, $4.9 million worth of savings trims the gap some,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=2496)|
| 0:41:40| and then we come to the reallocation portion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=2500)|
| 0:41:43| We fortunately have a very strategic federal programs director, Cheryl Martin,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=2503)|
| 0:41:50| who really, really came to the rescue for us on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=2510)|
| 0:41:53| She has been able to identify in a very strategic way how to use Title I carryover dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=2513)|
| 0:41:59| to help with the general purpose budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=2519)|
| 0:42:02| What this will do is allow us to move that portion of the cost related to the extended day portion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=2522)|
| 0:42:09| of priority schools to be funded from Title I carryover dollars,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=2529)|
| 0:42:13| but this relieves the general purpose budget by $1.1 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=2533)|
| 0:42:17| So there's no reduction in services here, but we can grab the savings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=2537)|
| 0:42:20| Now, I will say that we may have to revisit this strategy a year from now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=2540)|
| 0:42:26| but for the moment this has provided some relief for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=2546)|
| 0:42:31| So this is, you know, we'll have to grapple with this, you know, for the next budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=2551)|
| 0:42:36| We'll see what happens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=2556)|
| 0:42:38| Obviously we're going to do everything we can to protect this, but that's another $1.1 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=2558)|
| 0:42:44| And lastly, what we've just called cuts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=2564)|
| 0:42:47| There's not a really good way to sugar coat what a cut is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=2567)|
| 0:42:53| So a cut's a cut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=2573)|
| 0:42:54| You know, we've used other language before, but in times like this it's just call it what it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=2574)|
| 0:42:58| And this is a reduction, actual reduction in services, for lack of a better word,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=2578)|
| 0:43:05| and dollars in the base budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=2585)|
| 0:43:08| That first item there, well, let me just say this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=2588)|
| 0:43:11| We have done, as Mr. Thomas said, we did everything possible to try to keep the cuts away from the classroom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=2591)|
| 0:43:17| The bulk of our budget is instructional related, as it should be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=2597)|
| 0:43:23| So you do everything you can to try to stay away from that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=2603)|
| 0:43:27| But when that's your largest budgeted area, it's hard to stay totally away from it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=2607)|
| 0:43:32| So unfortunately there are some cuts here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=2612)|
| 0:43:34| We've tried to mitigate those cuts, though, as much as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=2614)|
| 0:43:37| The first one there is 50% reduction in school allocations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=2617)|
| 0:43:43| Let me talk a little bit about that because there has been some concerns within the last couple of days as to what this really means.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=2623)|
| 0:43:50| Particularly, you know, what we've heard is some concerns with magnet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=2630)|
| 0:43:56| These are not positions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=2636)|
| 0:43:59| These are school, what we call school allocations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=2639)|
| 0:44:02| And these allocations are used at the discretion of the school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=2642)|
| 0:44:05| whether it's for supplies and materials, professional development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=2645)|
| 0:44:09| But there's a host of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=2649)|
| 0:44:11| They're included in this amount.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=2651)|
| 0:44:13| We can save about a million dollars if we reduce this about 50%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=2653)|
| 0:44:16| About a little over 10% of this amount relates to magnet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=2656)|
| 0:44:20| The bulk of this relates to fee waiver allocations and just content area allocations that we provide to the school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=2660)|
| 0:44:28| So we're not wiping it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=2668)|
| 0:44:30| We're reducing it by 50%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=2670)|
| 0:44:32| We could capture a lot of money by doing this because it equates to saving, I don't know, 17, 18 teaching positions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=2672)|
| 0:44:41| I'm doing that off the top of my head.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=2681)|
| 0:44:43| So there's a lot of money here to grab.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=2683)|
| 0:44:45| Now, this seemed like a natural area for us here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=2685)|
| 0:44:49| First off, let me just say the intent of this line item was never to cut positions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=2689)|
| 0:44:55| We have bent over backwards in this budget to try to stay away from positions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=2695)|
| 0:45:00| There was never an intent to cut positions from here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=2700)|
| 0:45:03| But it seemed like a natural area for these allocations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=2703)|
| 0:45:08| because we currently have over a million dollars residing at the schools right now across the district in unspent allocations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=2708)|
| 0:45:17| So over $600,000 of that relates to just fee waiver allocations that haven't been spent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=2717)|
| 0:45:25| Over $260,000 relates to content area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=2725)|
| 0:45:29| Almost $100,000 relates to magnet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=2729)|
| 0:45:32| So we have a million dollars sitting there at the schools that we're hopeful that the schools will take those carryover funds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=2732)|
| 0:45:40| they can apply it to these reduced allocations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=2740)|
| 0:45:43| and they can get pretty close to restoring a lot of things that they want to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=2743)|
| 0:45:50| It's going to vary between schools on what those carryover amounts are, obviously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=2750)|
| 0:45:55| But I want to say that we will absolutely work with principals to make this work for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=2755)|
| 0:46:02| So if there's a combination of factors here, we're going to work with them to make this manageable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=2762)|
| 0:46:11| We're going to help them on their unspent carryover amounts to use those to supplement some of the reductions here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=2771)|
| 0:46:18| So there's going to be a combination of things, but we're not going to let schools just die on the vine on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=2778)|
| 0:46:25| So we're obviously going to work with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=2785)|
| 0:46:27| And I know Shannon and her folks do a fantastic job on working with principals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=2787)|
| 0:46:31| and helping them to think through some things on how to make this work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=2791)|
| 0:46:36| But there's not going to be any positions lost in this line item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=2796)|
| 0:46:39| So I just wanted to clarify that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=2799)|
| 0:46:43| Contracted services, $300,000 there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=2803)|
| 0:46:47| There's a reduction there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=2807)|
| 0:46:48| There's some things that we think we can do in-house that we have contracted out before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=2808)|
| 0:46:54| There is a little amount there we shaved off of pre-K.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=2814)|
| 0:46:58| This is not an elimination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=2818)|
| 0:47:00| This is a slight reduction of that program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=2820)|
| 0:47:02| So what we currently do is we spend more than the required match.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=2822)|
| 0:47:10| In order to receive the local grant, which we get, there is a required match.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=2830)|
| 0:47:13| We actually spend more than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=2833)|
| 0:47:15| This is just that excess amount above that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=2835)|
| 0:47:18| So this will result in probably losing a couple of classrooms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=2838)|
| 0:47:24| But we are restructuring that program, and so we don't anticipate that we would lose any services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=2844)|
| 0:47:30| So we're not going to turn kids away, I don't think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=2850)|
| 0:47:33| But this is just a way that we can kind of tighten up some things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=2853)|
| 0:47:38| And then the district-wide portion, the five-day furlough, we've talked about that, the 255-day reduction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=2858)|
| 0:47:45| I can tell you primarily this affects central office employees and head principals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=2865)|
| 0:47:52| Mr. Thomas talked about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=2872)|
| 0:47:54| It saves $700,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=2874)|
| 0:47:56| It's certainly not something that we want to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=2876)|
| 0:47:59| But in the context of preserving positions, we felt like this is an area we needed to look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=2879)|
| 0:48:06| Professional development, a 50% reduction there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=2886)|
| 0:48:09| That would include associated travel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=2889)|
| 0:48:12| Again, we think we can do some training in-house there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=2892)|
| 0:48:15| And then lastly, central office and system-wide, there's about 20 positions there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=2895)|
| 0:48:23| About 15 of those probably relates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=2903)|
| 0:48:25| We're still squaring some of this up, to be honest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=2905)|
| 0:48:28| We're trying to finalize how some of this will be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=2908)|
| 0:48:30| Departments are still working through some of their cuts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=2910)|
| 0:48:33| This is about 15th Seminary budget of $503.8 million, which is the available funding we think will be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=2913)|
| 0:48:41| Again, none of these cuts are pleasant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=2921)|
| 0:48:43| But, you know, there are many initiatives, very critical initiatives Mr. Thomas spoke about that we're not going to be able to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=2923)|
| 0:48:52| So anyway, at this point, I'll open it up for questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=2932)|
| 0:48:55| I have Joe and Joni here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=2935)|
| 0:48:57| They're actually the brains behind these numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=2937)|
| 0:49:00| And so if I can't answer anything, I'll yield to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=2940)|
| 0:49:05| Thank you, Mr. McPherson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=2945)|
| 0:49:06| Before we do that, can we – Ms. Coatney, would you read the agenda item, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=2946)|
| 0:49:11| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=2951)|
| 0:49:12| Approve the fiscal year 2021 general purpose budget at the major category level for $507,827,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=2952)|
| 0:49:25| We have a motion by Ms. Satterfield.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=2965)|
| 0:49:27| Do we have a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=2967)|
| 0:49:28| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=2968)|
| 0:49:29| A second by Ms. Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=2969)|
| 0:49:30| And now discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=2970)|
| 0:49:40| You just pull your mic down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=2980)|
| 0:49:41| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=2981)|
| 0:49:42| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=2982)|
| 0:49:43| For those of you who haven't been here before, sorry, I forgot we have three new board members who haven't had a meeting here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=2983)|
| 0:49:48| If you want to speak, just pull your mic down, and then the board chair will recognize you after that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=2988)|
| 0:49:54| You remember last time I raised my hand?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=2994)|
| 0:49:56| I did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=2996)|
| 0:49:59| I forgot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=2999)|
| 0:50:00| It's been a while since we've been in here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=3000)|
| 0:50:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=3002)|
| 0:50:03| Did anyone – Ms. Hill, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=3003)|
| 0:50:05| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=3005)|
| 0:50:07| Thank you, Ron.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=3007)|
| 0:50:08| I mean, I know – I think I know anyway what y'all have been through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=3008)|
| 0:50:14| But one thing I would appreciate if you would just clarify for the general public,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=3014)|
| 0:50:18| because I do think there is still some misunderstanding about this fund balance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=3018)|
| 0:50:23| Oh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=3023)|
| 0:50:24| And if you would put that in numbers instead of percentage so that when someone says, oh, there's all this money sitting there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=3024)|
| 0:50:34| I can do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=3034)|
| 0:50:35| So there was – before the COVID hit, the pandemic hit, we were at about $19 million of available fund balance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=3035)|
| 0:50:44| That's not total fund balance because total fund balance you get into outstanding encumbered funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=3044)|
| 0:50:49| There's some accounting reserves you have to have for prepays and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=3049)|
| 0:50:53| But that kind of confuses the situation, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=3053)|
| 0:50:55| So we talk about what's available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=3055)|
| 0:50:57| And so in March we had about $19 million available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=3057)|
| 0:51:00| Fifteen million of that represents the 3 percent requirement from the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=3060)|
| 0:51:05| So the state says that school districts must maintain 3 percent of their general operating budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=3065)|
| 0:51:12| Now, it's not the total budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=3072)|
| 0:51:13| There's some things you pull out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=3073)|
| 0:51:14| But for us it amounted to around $15 million, somewhere around in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=3074)|
| 0:51:18| So we had not – but that's available for spending.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=3078)|
| 0:51:20| So the state says you can spend it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=3080)|
| 0:51:22| It's for emergencies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=3082)|
| 0:51:23| Obviously it's raining right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=3083)|
| 0:51:25| So the state would have no problem for us doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=3085)|
| 0:51:27| So there's not a problem going in and spending it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=3087)|
| 0:51:29| The problem comes in with maintaining it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=3089)|
| 0:51:32| And so in order to maintain it, it affects the following year budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=3092)|
| 0:51:36| So you have to budget for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=3096)|
| 0:51:38| Now, what we are looking at right now is we started out at $19 million in March.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=3098)|
| 0:51:46| The revenue shortfall that we're having to try to predict,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=3106)|
| 0:51:51| and we won't really know exactly until around August probably what this looks like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=3111)|
| 0:51:55| the revenue shortfall is going to be what we think anywhere –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=3115)|
| 0:52:00| it's going to put us at an amount of anywhere between $7 million to $11 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=3120)|
| 0:52:06| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=3126)|
| 0:52:08| Going into the next budget year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=3128)|
| 0:52:11| And so what we're going to have to do is replenish anywhere from $4 million to $8 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=3131)|
| 0:52:16| Now, we think we have some items identified in expenditures that would qualify for CARES Act money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=3136)|
| 0:52:26| I'll be perfectly honest that we have received some really conflicting information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=3146)|
| 0:52:33| from different agencies of the state, but we think we can work through that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=3153)|
| 0:52:40| And so we do have some strategies to use some of that money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=3160)|
| 0:52:43| Obviously, the bulk of that money will be used for the one-to-one initiative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=3163)|
| 0:52:46| We've already committed to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=3166)|
| 0:52:47| But the leftover funds, we would like to strategically use those funds to pay for qualifying expenses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=3167)|
| 0:52:56| If we can do that, then that would ease the tension on the fund balance by $4 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=3176)|
| 0:53:03| The $4 million in this budget would be the remaining $4 million that we have to close the gap.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=3183)|
| 0:53:08| And so that's where we have to budget that amount out of recurring revenue, to be honest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=3188)|
| 0:53:15| And so that would put us back up to the $15 million level, assuming all of these assumptions are correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=3195)|
| 0:53:21| There has been some—we've heard a lot of questions, really good questions, with respect to the county's fund balance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=3201)|
| 0:53:29| I can't speak for the county on this, but I can tell you that a healthy fund balance at the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=3209)|
| 0:53:36| we actually receive direct benefits from that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=3216)|
| 0:53:39| because a healthy fund balance allows us to have very favorable interest rates on our capital improvements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=3219)|
| 0:53:47| Because we utilize bonds to pay for those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=3227)|
| 0:53:50| It's much like a mortgage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=3230)|
| 0:53:52| And so we make payments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=3232)|
| 0:53:54| When something comes out of the ground, we just don't write a check for $30 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=3234)|
| 0:53:58| We actually finance that over maybe a 20-year span.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=3238)|
| 0:54:01| So a healthy fund balance allows us to have very favorable rates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=3241)|
| 0:54:05| And so we do actually receive some benefits on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=3245)|
| 0:54:09| Number two, there is a need for the county to retain a healthy level because, as you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=3249)|
| 0:54:19| BEP comes in in 10 installments throughout the year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=3259)|
| 0:54:24| But we don't have just 10 months of expenses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=3264)|
| 0:54:27| So we have 12 months of expenses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=3267)|
| 0:54:29| And so our payroll is $36 million a month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=3269)|
| 0:54:34| It is huge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=3274)|
| 0:54:36| We don't receive BEP payments in July and August.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=3276)|
| 0:54:41| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=3281)|
| 0:54:42| We do have other revenue on hand, you know, sales taxes and property taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=3282)|
| 0:54:48| But property taxes, we get a lot of those in February, right, and some in December.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=3288)|
| 0:54:53| Sales taxes, we get a lot in December.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=3293)|
| 0:54:56| But revenue doesn't come along in nice, neat little increments like our expenses do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=3296)|
| 0:55:02| So when you roll into the summer months, there better be cash on hand from somebody, you know, to pay these expenses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=3302)|
| 0:55:09| And so it's not a budgetary issue for us, but that is two months' worth of BEP payments that we don't get.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=3309)|
| 0:55:15| And so it becomes a cash flow issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=3315)|
| 0:55:19| And so we, along with the county and all other funds, participate in the local investment pool, so to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=3319)|
| 0:55:26| And so for lack of a better word, it's one huge bucket, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=3326)|
| 0:55:31| And we all tap in out of that, and we keep track of how much is attributed for each of our funds through the accounting portion of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=3331)|
| 0:55:39| So it really is to everybody's benefit that there is a healthy fund balance there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=3339)|
| 0:55:44| Obviously, we would love, we would never turn down money if it came our way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=3344)|
| 0:55:49| But I do think it's important to clarify that a healthy fund balance actually benefits the school system too, because it helps us with cash flow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=3349)|
| 0:55:58| Not because we're running out of money, but because of the timing of that money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=3358)|
| 0:56:02| So anyway, I hope that clears it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=3362)|
| 0:56:05| And the fact that the state requires a 3 percent balance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=3365)|
| 0:56:10| It does. It requires a 3 percent balance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=3370)|
| 0:56:12| And, you know, we've even kicked around, you know, does it make sense to talk with legislators and try to ease up on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=3372)|
| 0:56:18| That would help this budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=3378)|
| 0:56:19| But the reality of it is it really just is financially responsible to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=3379)|
| 0:56:25| You know, they tell districts to do it, but you kind of need to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=3385)|
| 0:56:31| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=3391)|
| 0:56:33| Thank you, Ron.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=3393)|
| 0:56:34| Ms. Patton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=3394)|
| 0:56:35| Yeah, and Ron, I don't know if this question is for you, but professional development is obviously a big cut in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=3395)|
| 0:56:42| And I do think it's important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=3402)|
| 0:56:44| Can someone speak to sort of how we feel like we are going to accomplish professional development this year with the cuts we're doing in budgeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=3404)|
| 0:56:52| Okay, yeah, I may yield to Shannon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=3412)|
| 0:56:54| Ms. Jackson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=3414)|
| 0:56:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=3415)|
| 0:56:59| Good evening, Madam Chair, members of the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=3419)|
| 0:57:01| Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=3421)|
| 0:57:02| Professional development is something that is incredibly important to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=3422)|
| 0:57:05| And as a district, we have a strong belief and philosophy in professional development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=3425)|
| 0:57:09| And it's something that starts with working through needs assessments with our schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=3429)|
| 0:57:14| and working through our microteams and putting together systems of professional development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=3434)|
| 0:57:19| So while it is disappointing to lose, you know, any additional funding for that, we do have a plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=3439)|
| 0:57:25| We've spoken about our plan a couple of times in board meetings recently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=3445)|
| 0:57:30| And we have a very laser-like focus on making sure that we're ready to be open as a one-to-one school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=3450)|
| 0:57:35| and to think through what this could look like in distance or in person or SACC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=3455)|
| 0:57:43| However we end up opening school, we have a focus on that and supporting teachers throughout the school year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=3463)|
| 0:57:48| on how we adjust for those various phases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=3468)|
| 0:57:51| So we have people in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=3471)|
| 0:57:53| We are working with people in the schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=3473)|
| 0:57:55| We just had 74 school people help us work on the course that just went out to principals this week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=3475)|
| 0:58:01| So we're really looking at building the capacity at the school level for leading that work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=3481)|
| 0:58:05| because there's a lot of talent there that just needs to be shared across our district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=3485)|
| 0:58:09| So I guess that's a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=3489)|
| 0:58:10| I mean, we obviously, I mean, the dollars for it have been cut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=3490)|
| 0:58:14| So where is that money being cut and how are we sort of reallocating?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=3494)|
| 0:58:19| Is it just a, I mean, what are we paying for that we're not paying for now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=3499)|
| 0:58:22| Right, so these are allocations that would go to the schools so that the schools would have a little bit of money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=3502)|
| 0:58:28| I think last year I was able to fund them at about 75 cents a student.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=3508)|
| 0:58:31| It was not a huge allocation for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=3511)|
| 0:58:34| Our bigger PD dollars come from our Title II-A funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=3514)|
| 0:58:38| And that's where we have support people who are in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=3518)|
| 0:58:41| We are able to fund our year-long reading course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=3521)|
| 0:58:45| Using our demonstration classrooms has been something that we have done through that title budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=3525)|
| 0:58:50| in order for teachers who really feel comfortable with a particular initiative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=3530)|
| 0:58:53| and letting other teachers come in and see them in action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=3533)|
| 0:58:57| That all comes through the federal dollars, and that's where the bulk of our professional development lives,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=3537)|
| 0:59:02| and then also in some Title IV.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=3542)|
| 0:59:04| Are we expecting any cuts on that federal funding?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=3544)|
| 0:59:07| That budget was put forth last month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=3547)|
| 0:59:10| And what I'm able to do with that is pretty stable for this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=3550)|
| 0:59:14| So a few minor adjustments, but nothing that will impact tremendously what we're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=3554)|
| 0:59:20| So, I mean, it sounds like the bulk of your professional development money is still there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=3560)|
| 0:59:24| It's the side that was coming from our general purposes is hurt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=3564)|
| 0:59:28| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=3568)|
| 0:59:29| Okay, that helps. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=3569)|
| 0:59:32| Thank you, Ms. Jackson. Ms. Irwin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=3572)|
| 0:59:35| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=3575)|
| 0:59:36| Mr. McPherson, could you tell us that monthly payroll number again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=3576)|
| 0:59:41| It's not exact, but it's around $36 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=3581)|
| 0:59:44| So if we had a situation where we had an entire month of income missing for whatever reason,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=3584)|
| 0:59:54| there's no way we could make that up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=3594)|
| 0:59:56| There's no way we could pay staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=3596)|
| 0:59:58| Well, let me just clarify that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=3598)|
| 1:00:00| So, again, if something like that happened, I mean, we would see that coming down the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=3600)|
| 1:00:07| Obviously, we would start to see revenue trends start to really slow,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=3607)|
| 1:00:10| and then we would make budget adjustments along the way to ensure that didn't happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=3610)|
| 1:00:14| But hypothetically, based on what you're saying, the answer to that would be yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=3614)|
| 1:00:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=3618)|
| 1:00:19| So my thinking there is that when we're looking at that 3% that we're holding onto for a rainy day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=3619)|
| 1:00:29| we need to really think about more than a rainy day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=3629)|
| 1:00:32| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=3632)|
| 1:00:34| Otherwise, I mean, that's just going to cover a little drizzle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=3634)|
| 1:00:39| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=3639)|
| 1:00:40| Now, I will say I don't want folks to be panicked that, oh, no, we're not going to make payroll.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=3640)|
| 1:00:46| That's not going to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=3646)|
| 1:00:48| I was in a county that did that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=3648)|
| 1:00:50| Wow, that's not good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=3650)|
| 1:00:51| So we're going to see down the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=3651)|
| 1:00:52| I mean, we're monitoring revenue very closely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=3652)|
| 1:00:54| And so before we would ever let something like that happen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=3654)|
| 1:00:56| that would be why we would show up here at the board and say, listen, we've got to modify this thing some more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=3656)|
| 1:01:01| We hope that doesn't happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=3661)|
| 1:01:03| But also keep in mind that this also speaks again to the county's fund balance as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=3663)|
| 1:01:12| And so these are all these dollars are in a pool, so to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=3672)|
| 1:01:17| Now, that doesn't mean it's just everybody can jump in and grab it because we all operate with budgets, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=3677)|
| 1:01:22| So we have constraints on how we spend that money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=3682)|
| 1:01:24| So that's where the accounting part comes in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=3684)|
| 1:01:27| But from a practical perspective, obviously we would modify the budget accordingly before that happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=3687)|
| 1:01:35| But to your point, it's well stated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=3695)|
| 1:01:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=3698)|
| 1:01:39| I think that's important to help the public understand that when we're looking at that big bucket of money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=3699)|
| 1:01:44| it's not a big bucket of money that it's emergency money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=3704)|
| 1:01:50| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=3710)|
| 1:01:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=3712)|
| 1:01:53| And the rest is just some comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=3713)|
| 1:01:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=3715)|
| 1:01:56| I think I've already worn you out with the questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=3716)|
| 1:02:00| As a board, I think we need to be looking far into the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=3720)|
| 1:02:07| We have estimates from our comptroller that we've had for years that say that our schools are underfunded by $400 million every year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=3727)|
| 1:02:16| Every year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=3736)|
| 1:02:17| And that the number of teachers we should have in the BEP formula, we are short about 22%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=3737)|
| 1:02:26| So if year after year after year our legislature underfunds us by that kind of number, and that's been going on for decades,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=3746)|
| 1:02:38| then when we are in a situation where there's a problem, there's nothing left to cut| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=3758)|
| 1:02:43| because we have cut it and cut it and cut it and cut it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=3763)|
| 1:02:47| And I think we really have to help folks understand where the main piece of our funding comes from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=3767)|
| 1:02:58| and that right now we can't ask for money for this budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=3778)|
| 1:03:04| If we want to increase revenue, we have to start asking to increase the revenue for next year's budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=3784)|
| 1:03:12| because the money has to be there before we can start looking at how to spend it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=3792)|
| 1:03:17| So I think it's very important that we help our communities understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=3797)|
| 1:03:22| I think far too long we've just been able to say, you know, we're doing more with less.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=3802)|
| 1:03:27| There's no more less that we can do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=3807)|
| 1:03:31| We can't cut anything else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=3811)|
| 1:03:33| We have to help our communities understand what we have to do to get more revenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=3813)|
| 1:03:41| The BEP was adopted in 92 and it was updated in 2007, but they never really completely finished it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=3821)|
| 1:03:50| They didn't follow all the recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=3830)|
| 1:03:55| They did the part they wanted to, and it's gotten smaller and smaller and smaller every single year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=3835)|
| 1:04:02| And while we're thinking about that and the allocations that we're cutting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=3842)|
| 1:04:08| just looking at the department that I was in, I know that my brain didn't go back far enough,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=3848)|
| 1:04:13| but I remembered, well, that allocation was cut and it was cut and it was cut,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=3853)|
| 1:04:18| and then it would come back a little bit and then it would be cut again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=3858)|
| 1:04:21| So I went back to some of my colleagues and I said, what do you remember?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=3861)|
| 1:04:27| In talking to several people, what I found out is that some of the allocations for our teachers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=3867)|
| 1:04:33| for those supplies in the classroom have not changed since 1985.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=3873)|
| 1:04:41| I mean, that's significant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=3881)|
| 1:04:44| When we're looking at a classroom that can't buy a pencil for every student| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=3884)|
| 1:04:51| because the allocation is so small, and that is a literal example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=3891)|
| 1:04:59| Yes, we've worked very hard with what we've been given because we had to, but we can't go on that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=3899)|
| 1:05:06| We have to get more for our students so that when hard times come,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=3906)|
| 1:05:13| there would be something that we could look at cutting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=3913)|
| 1:05:16| So I think all of these areas that we're cutting, I'm not saying that we can't cut them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=3916)|
| 1:05:20| We have to cut them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=3920)|
| 1:05:23| I also want to point out, Mr. McPherson keeps talking about $10 million,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=3923)|
| 1:05:30| but if we really look at the budget that we wanted, it's $20 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=3930)|
| 1:05:37| We're $20 million short, and there's not a thing that we can do about it because it's just not there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=3937)|
| 1:05:46| We have to get it there for the next budget cycle,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=3946)|
| 1:05:50| and our communities have to do that right now because by the time we start this part, it's too late.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=3950)|
| 1:05:58| The money's just not there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=3958)|
| 1:06:00| We can't make it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=3960)|
| 1:06:02| Can we make it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=3962)|
| 1:06:06| Can we call a print shop?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=3966)|
| 1:06:12| I think our board has to be, we've been so careful with not making legislators mad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=3972)|
| 1:06:19| They have to help our kids, and if it makes them mad, they're just going to have to be mad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=3979)|
| 1:06:26| That's all I have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=3986)|
| 1:06:28| Thank you, Ms. Owen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=3988)|
| 1:06:30| Ms. Christie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=3990)|
| 1:06:31| Yeah, I just have a question about the magnet funding and the allocations about it not being staffing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=3991)|
| 1:06:40| but the reality is that it does seem like it's staffing at a lot of our magnet schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=4000)|
| 1:06:47| So I'm not really sure where that disconnect is because I assume that when they present their magnet budgets,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=4007)|
| 1:06:54| that someone approves them, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=4014)|
| 1:06:57| I mean, it doesn't just stay at the school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=4017)|
| 1:06:59| We've, and I may have to turn to Yilta Shannon on this if I get too deep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=4019)|
| 1:07:05| I don't know what I'm talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=4025)|
| 1:07:06| But we went through and looked, and there's no positions per se funded with this money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=4026)|
| 1:07:11| We do, there is one school that does have, they've added a point, I'm going to say a .2 to their position to get that to a full time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=4031)|
| 1:07:24| And so obviously, you know, it's a lot of money to the school, but in the grand scheme of things, it's not a lot of money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=4044)|
| 1:07:32| And so what we would obviously do is we would help that school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=4052)|
| 1:07:35| I mean, it's not our intent for anybody to lose positions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=4055)|
| 1:07:38| There's another school that has used some of this money for stipends.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=4058)|
| 1:07:42| And that's one of the things, you know, we're going to have to take a look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=4062)|
| 1:07:46| But I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=4066)|
| 1:07:47| Shannon, can you add anything more to this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=4067)|
| 1:07:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=4069)|
| 1:07:50| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=4070)|
| 1:07:51| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=4071)|
| 1:07:52| So our process the last two years has been for the magnet schools when they get their allocation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=4072)|
| 1:07:59| we have worked with them on initiatives that will advance the three goals within the strategic plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=4079)|
| 1:08:05| eliminating disparities, increasing student achievement, and promoting positive culture,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=4085)|
| 1:08:10| but also looking at the five pillars of magnet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=4090)|
| 1:08:13| We've encouraged them to focus most closely on the four that are connected to the programming for the students who live in zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=4093)|
| 1:08:20| unless they are a school that doesn't have a zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=4100)|
| 1:08:23| And with their school improvement plan, and then we approve along those lines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=4103)|
| 1:08:28| So we wanted to make sure it was connected to that magnet theme that they are developing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=4108)|
| 1:08:32| So most of them have two or three initiatives that they're funding out of this each year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=4112)|
| 1:08:38| And we sit down two times a year and go over with them where they are in that plan and the development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=4118)|
| 1:08:45| and where they are in the spending.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=4125)|
| 1:08:47| Some of the funds that you see there that remain in their accounts this year are because some of that work was going to happen while we were closed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=4127)|
| 1:08:54| So I guess just to kind of be clear, so I'm looking at a magnet budget right here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=4134)|
| 1:09:01| And the top line item is salary and wages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=4141)|
| 1:09:07| And there's like $17,000 there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=4147)|
| 1:09:10| So is that something we're going to help the school with?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=4150)|
| 1:09:13| I need to turn that one over to Ron.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=4153)|
| 1:09:17| I mean, when you say we're not cutting positions, I'm just wondering, just to get some clarification on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=4157)|
| 1:09:23| I'm sorry, which page?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=4163)|
| 1:09:25| Well, this is one of the magnets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=4165)|
| 1:09:28| Oh, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=4168)|
| 1:09:29| So if they have in their budget, let's say, $17,000 for salary and wages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=4169)|
| 1:09:34| So when you're saying that you'll help them get to there, you will help them fund that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=4174)|
| 1:09:40| I guess I would need the – I'm not sure which school that – is it a plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=4180)|
| 1:09:46| Well, it's just their budget that they had for this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=4186)|
| 1:09:49| Oh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=4189)|
| 1:09:50| It was – they – so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=4190)|
| 1:09:54| Okay, I'd have to look at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=4194)|
| 1:09:56| But let me say it this way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=4196)|
| 1:09:57| I'm just saying if they have it listed as salary and wages, then it's people helping the students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=4197)|
| 1:10:02| Is that the same thing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=4202)|
| 1:10:03| We – let me say it this way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=4203)|
| 1:10:05| It is not our intent in any way for a school to have to lose a position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=4205)|
| 1:10:10| So what we would do – and I think, Shannon, help me out if I say this – make sure I say this correctly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=4210)|
| 1:10:15| that we would do everything we can to help them to structure this in a way to where they're not losing a position| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=4215)|
| 1:10:21| if that's what they want to hold on to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=4221)|
| 1:10:23| And it may come from a combination of remaining carryover funds that they haven't spent with regards to their magnet program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=4223)|
| 1:10:33| But what I'm aware of is that there are – there is a school that has used some stipend dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=4233)|
| 1:10:44| They're not really funding a position, but they have used some of these magnet allocations for stipends.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=4244)|
| 1:10:51| But I'm not aware of any actual positions that's being funded through this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=4251)|
| 1:10:56| So I'd probably need to dig a little bit more as to what that consists of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=4256)|
| 1:11:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=4266)|
| 1:11:07| Did I say that right, Shannon?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=4267)|
| 1:11:09| I think so, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=4269)|
| 1:11:10| I need to know the specific school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=4270)|
| 1:11:12| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=4272)|
| 1:11:13| We would – right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=4273)|
| 1:11:14| If we could maybe get the specific school there and then we can provide some more clarity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=4274)|
| 1:11:20| Mr. McPherson, does anyone else have a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=4280)|
| 1:11:23| While you're there, I have just a comment, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=4283)|
| 1:11:27| It looks like some of the things that we've had to cut could be adjusted if we see that things improve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=4287)|
| 1:11:37| Can you talk a little bit about that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=4297)|
| 1:11:39| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=4299)|
| 1:11:40| And, again, we're hopeful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=4300)|
| 1:11:44| We're not – I'm not going to say that we're expecting to get more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=4304)|
| 1:11:49| I'm saying we're hopeful we can get more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=4309)|
| 1:11:51| There are a host of items there that we could look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=4311)|
| 1:11:55| For instance, we've already talked about the insurance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=4315)|
| 1:11:56| We've talked about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=4316)|
| 1:11:58| The restoration of the five days, the furlough days, that's something we could take a look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=4318)|
| 1:12:03| Obviously, the school allocations, we can take a look at that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=4323)|
| 1:12:09| So I'm looking up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=4329)|
| 1:12:10| I'm glancing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=4330)|
| 1:12:12| Aside from the fact that 20 positions are eliminated, that would be very difficult, obviously,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=4332)|
| 1:12:19| if we're three, four months down the road to say, you know what, boy, this is a lot better than we thought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=4339)|
| 1:12:25| Wish we hadn't cut them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=4345)|
| 1:12:29| That would be difficult, obviously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=4349)|
| 1:12:31| But I think most up there we could take a look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=4351)|
| 1:12:35| Well, I appreciate – so I appreciate your – I think the public has no idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=4355)|
| 1:12:40| They have no idea how many hours and blood, sweat, and tears that you all put in this budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=4360)|
| 1:12:46| and the time that you put into this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=4366)|
| 1:12:49| I mean Joe and Joni have been looking at this budget since September – well, since August.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=4369)|
| 1:12:54| I think they've probably done about 30 budgets because on a daily basis we would have to –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=4374)|
| 1:12:58| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=4378)|
| 1:12:59| They've looked at so many different scenarios because I know we saw this for the first time in September.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=4379)|
| 1:13:03| So I just think that the public – I appreciate the work that you put in and that all of you put in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=4383)|
| 1:13:09| and the executive team and the superintendent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=4389)|
| 1:13:12| And, you know, I really – I also have to say how much I appreciate, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=4392)|
| 1:13:18| you guys are the ones who are taking the pay cut with the 255-day furlough, and that was your idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=4398)|
| 1:13:25| And, you know, I touched base with all my principals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=4405)|
| 1:13:29| Every single one of them would much rather take the pay cut than have to cut a position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=4409)|
| 1:13:34| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=4414)|
| 1:13:35| So we really have staff who care deeply about students and want the best for students,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=4415)|
| 1:13:41| and they are so caring, and so I just appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=4421)|
| 1:13:48| And I think that we tend to hear a lot of the negative because nobody likes this budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=4428)|
| 1:13:53| I know nobody in this room likes this budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=4433)|
| 1:13:56| You know, I know the superintendent has grieved over this budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=4436)|
| 1:14:01| So anyway, I just really appreciate the thoughtful way that you've looked at this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=4441)|
| 1:14:07| and the time and effort that you've put into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=4447)|
| 1:14:09| And I appreciate the explanation about the fund balance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=4449)|
| 1:14:12| I hope that helps a little bit also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=4452)|
| 1:14:17| Do we have other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=4457)|
| 1:14:20| Oh, Mr. McMillan, sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=4460)|
| 1:14:22| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=4462)|
| 1:14:27| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=4467)|
| 1:14:30| I guess I want to ask you, Mr. McPherson, I want to make a comment too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=4470)|
| 1:14:38| and then I'll have a question, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=4478)|
| 1:14:41| This has obviously been just an absolutely terrible year from an economic standpoint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=4481)|
| 1:14:52| But we don't like to think about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=4492)|
| 1:14:57| But next year could be every bit as bad, if not worse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=4497)|
| 1:15:03| I'm not any, you know, that's not my thing as far as predicting the economy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=4503)|
| 1:15:11| But I do read quite a bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=4511)|
| 1:15:15| And nobody, you know, this is a one-time-in-a-century event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=4515)|
| 1:15:23| So nobody knows exactly what to expect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=4523)|
| 1:15:27| But most learned people in the economy believe that as it comes back, it will come back slow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=4527)|
| 1:15:38| So whatever you lose in a year, it may take you, you know, three times, four times that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=4538)|
| 1:15:48| what you lost to make it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=4548)|
| 1:15:53| I guess what concerns me, and as you all said, you all did a really good job putting it together,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=4553)|
| 1:16:05| presenting it to us individually and then to the public and everything with what you had worked with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=4565)|
| 1:16:15| But it still bothers me a little bit that, about the step raises for the teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=4575)|
| 1:16:37| In Knox County, what would you say that the average raise would amount to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=4597)|
| 1:16:46| Upwards from step to step?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=4606)|
| 1:16:48| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=4608)|
| 1:16:50| On the BS lane, I think it was $952 on average for a bachelor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=4610)|
| 1:16:59| Slightly below a thousand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=4619)|
| 1:17:01| A thousand, yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=4621)|
| 1:17:03| So since we've got the insurance taken care of now, there would be no,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=4623)|
| 1:17:09| I know some people have talked about insurance, comparing it to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=4629)|
| 1:17:15| But what you said about the insurance, there wouldn't be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=4635)|
| 1:17:19| Originally had thought the increase was going to be around 7%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=4639)|
| 1:17:23| So just yesterday we received notification from the state that it looks like it's going to be more like 2%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=4643)|
| 1:17:30| So that obviously would be less of a strain on paychecks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=4650)|
| 1:17:36| So it would still be an additional amount, which is never good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=4656)|
| 1:17:41| But it won't be to the degree that we feared.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=4661)|
| 1:17:46| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=4666)|
| 1:17:47| Well, I guess what bothers me is when I run into my neighbor or someone that I know at the store that's lost their job,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=4667)|
| 1:18:02| they have no job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=4682)|
| 1:18:04| Now, they may not be starving, but they've got a little money laid back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=4684)|
| 1:18:11| But it's kind of hard to explain, from my perspective, as a board member,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=4691)|
| 1:18:20| why did certain teachers get raises when I don't even have a job and I'm a tax payer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=4700)|
| 1:18:29| And you all have taken cuts to people that are working the 255.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=4709)|
| 1:18:37| So I know there's probably nothing that we can do about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=4717)|
| 1:18:45| But if we were to, just for argument's sake, if we were to forego the raises| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=4725)|
| 1:18:57| and then we found money, say, in January for the staff raise, could we add them back?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=4737)|
| 1:19:08| I think so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=4748)|
| 1:19:12| I think we would have to have discussions, obviously, with our PECA group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=4752)|
| 1:19:16| Well, we could probably add them at some point, if not in January.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=4756)|
| 1:19:22| We could add them before the fiscal year ends.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=4762)|
| 1:19:26| I think so. I probably need Scott Bolton's answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=4766)|
| 1:19:28| I can get you a definitive answer on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=4768)|
| 1:19:32| I will say, and I definitely appreciate your remarks there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=4772)|
| 1:19:36| I will say that when we don't grant step increases to teachers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=4776)|
| 1:19:41| it puts us in a bit of a bind for a number of reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=4781)|
| 1:19:49| One is that we lose ground.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=4789)|
| 1:19:54| Presumably if other districts did give step increases,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=4794)|
| 1:19:56| we would lose ground on our average teacher pay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=4796)|
| 1:19:59| That would be one thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=4799)|
| 1:20:00| Number two, it hurts us when we're recruiting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=4800)|
| 1:20:05| So if we're recruiting someone with X number of years of experience,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=4805)|
| 1:20:09| we would hire them in at that level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=4809)|
| 1:20:11| We would have an existing teacher when we didn't grant that years of experience to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=4811)|
| 1:20:15| So we would be hiring somebody in with the same amount of experience| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=4815)|
| 1:20:18| at a higher level than what our existing teacher has.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=4818)|
| 1:20:21| So you kind of have to deal with some of those struggles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=4821)|
| 1:20:24| I'm not saying that we couldn't do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=4824)|
| 1:20:26| I'm just saying that there were a number of factors that weighed into our decision here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=4826)|
| 1:20:33| So I certainly understand what you're saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=4833)|
| 1:20:36| I appreciate your comments, and I do understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=4836)|
| 1:20:44| But, you know, I mean, they might go somewhere else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=4844)|
| 1:20:50| But if we – there's no reason, since this is a one-time event,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=4850)|
| 1:20:58| that we couldn't skip them next year and not just raise them one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=4858)|
| 1:21:07| but we could raise them on up where they should be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=4867)|
| 1:21:12| Is there anything to prevent that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=4872)|
| 1:21:15| There's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=4875)|
| 1:21:17| I can tell you it would be an $8 million lift, obviously, if we tried to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=4877)|
| 1:21:22| So a lot of times once you – I remember – Bob will remember this probably better than I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=4882)|
| 1:21:28| It may have been 10 years ago or more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=4888)|
| 1:21:31| We did not pass on a step raise to our classified employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=4891)|
| 1:21:37| And to this day, just probably two months ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=4897)|
| 1:21:41| I received an email from one of our employees wanting to know if we were ever going to restore that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=4901)|
| 1:21:49| And so what tends to happen is if you don't pass it on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=4909)|
| 1:21:53| budgets are so difficult from year to year that you never really find the money to make up the ground.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=4913)|
| 1:21:59| So, again, there's nothing I don't think that would stop us from doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=4919)|
| 1:22:02| I just think it would probably be a real heavy lift, number one, to try to get it back into the –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=4922)|
| 1:22:09| I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=4929)|
| 1:22:10| Thank you for your comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=4930)|
| 1:22:13| And, you know, again, it may just be me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=4933)|
| 1:22:18| but I have a really hard time explaining to somebody why – you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=4938)|
| 1:22:27| I don't know why you lost your job and can't find another one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=4947)|
| 1:22:31| But so-and-so was mowing their yard, and they never missed a paycheck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=4951)|
| 1:22:37| Or they went fishing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=4957)|
| 1:22:39| And I realize there are some teachers out there that were doing schoolwork while they were off, you know, on their own.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=4959)|
| 1:22:48| But a lot of them had a lot of what we will call leisure time, I guess, to do things they wanted to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=4968)|
| 1:23:01| Having said that, I'll probably make everybody mad and go nowhere,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=4981)|
| 1:23:07| but I will make a motion that we drop the step raises for the certified people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=4987)|
| 1:23:28| Can we have a motion on the floor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=5008)|
| 1:23:33| Mr. McMillan, is that an amendment to the current motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=5013)|
| 1:23:38| Well, yeah, that would be fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=5018)|
| 1:23:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=5020)|
| 1:23:41| That would be fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=5021)|
| 1:23:46| Do I hear a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=5026)|
| 1:23:47| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=5027)|
| 1:23:48| Okay, we have a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=5028)|
| 1:23:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=5030)|
| 1:23:51| And so we'll consider that amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=5031)|
| 1:23:57| Yeah, do we have discussion on that now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=5037)|
| 1:23:59| I know I had several people with mics down, so let me just go in order that I've taken them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=5039)|
| 1:24:05| I think Ms. Hill was first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=5045)|
| 1:24:07| Yeah, Ms. Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=5047)|
| 1:24:10| Addressing specifically the amended motion is what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=5050)|
| 1:24:16| For the most part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=5056)|
| 1:24:17| The list I have of people who wanted to speak was actually prior to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=5057)|
| 1:24:21| I got you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=5061)|
| 1:24:22| I will just address the motion at this point and then come back to some other comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=5062)|
| 1:24:25| Sure, that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=5065)|
| 1:24:28| Mr. McMillan, I really do hear what you're saying and appreciate some of your comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=5068)|
| 1:24:38| In addition to some of the things that Mr. McPherson said about that, though,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=5078)|
| 1:24:44| what concerns me in taking such a drastic step is that we already struggle with our pay compared to our surrounding counties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=5084)|
| 1:24:57| and I'm guessing probably most other counties, I don't know what they're going to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=5097)|
| 1:25:03| but probably they're not going to take an action like not giving a step increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=5103)|
| 1:25:11| And honestly, I think that just digs us into a hole even deeper than really we find ourselves in already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=5111)|
| 1:25:20| So much of that goes back to Ms. Owens' point about from the top-down trickle that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=5120)|
| 1:25:30| we can only do so much with what we are given here locally,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=5130)|
| 1:25:34| and we kind of need to look beyond ourselves for some of that thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=5134)|
| 1:25:39| So for that reason, I would not be able to vote for that amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=5139)|
| 1:25:44| They probably wouldn't be able to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=5144)|
| 1:25:47| I realize what you're saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=5147)|
| 1:25:49| They probably wouldn't be able to go there and get a job if they were unhappy here, even under these circumstances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=5149)|
| 1:26:01| Ms. Satterfield?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=5161)|
| 1:26:02| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=5162)|
| 1:26:03| I have more to say after we get through this motion, but Mr. McMillan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=5163)|
| 1:26:07| that was definitely something that jumped out to me when the budget was presented,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=5167)|
| 1:26:11| that we have people in our communities that do not have jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=5171)|
| 1:26:16| I mean, my own family, my friends, they don't have jobs, but we're giving raises.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=5176)|
| 1:26:20| And so you're not alone in thinking, how do you explain that to someone who's just struggling on unemployment right now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=5180)|
| 1:26:27| And so I completely, 100 percent agree with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=5187)|
| 1:26:30| I hear the explanation as to it will be significantly harder to continue to dig ourselves out of the hole,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=5190)|
| 1:26:38| and I do hope that we take Board Member Owen's suggestion, as standing as a board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=5198)|
| 1:26:44| to be very vocal about how much we are actually missing from the state level of money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=5204)|
| 1:26:49| so we will not have to continue to dig in the hole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=5209)|
| 1:26:52| There are things that I will address after this motion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=5212)|
| 1:26:56| but you're not along with us with seeing that people are getting raises when people don't have jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=5216)|
| 1:27:03| And that's no discredit to educators' work, but that does definitely send a precedent out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=5223)|
| 1:27:10| Hi, Ms. Spabs. I'm sorry, you don't have a comment on that one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=5230)|
| 1:27:14| Ms. Bounds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=5234)|
| 1:27:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=5235)|
| 1:27:17| One of the things I want people to keep in mind, because I've been on the Board now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=5237)|
| 1:27:22| and when I came on the Board, the collaborative conferencing was not very effective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=5242)|
| 1:27:29| We started before most school systems,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=5249)|
| 1:27:32| and we were at the deadline in getting our memorandum of understanding signed and sent in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=5252)|
| 1:27:41| And with the change in leadership, I think this district's made great strides in improving that culture| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=5261)|
| 1:27:48| and developing a positive culture, which is one of the superintendent's main points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=5268)|
| 1:27:54| And while it may not be legally binding, it is in good faith that we develop a memorandum of understanding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=5274)|
| 1:28:03| through the PECA as a team with both the administration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=5283)|
| 1:28:08| That team's made up of our educators, our principals, our central office staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=5288)|
| 1:28:14| and they worked for, I guess, over a year to collaborate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=5294)|
| 1:28:19| and to come up with an agreement that both sides feel is adequate and they can live with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=5299)|
| 1:28:26| And so it has larger ramifications of just a race.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=5306)|
| 1:28:32| It's also about how we work as a system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=5312)|
| 1:28:36| and how that whole collaborative conferencing that our state legislature passed works| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=5316)|
| 1:28:45| and how we develop that memorandum of understanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=5325)|
| 1:28:49| So given that, and having talked to teachers out in the field,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=5329)|
| 1:28:55| that was one of the questions they asked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=5335)|
| 1:28:57| They were more than willing to give up their 4%,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=5337)|
| 1:29:00| which is also a part of the memorandum of understanding that we're supposed to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=5340)|
| 1:29:07| I guess it was 4%, was it 4, every year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=5347)|
| 1:29:10| and that had not happened until last year, and that did not seem to bother them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=5350)|
| 1:29:16| But the step increases was a source of contention,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=5356)|
| 1:29:20| and I heard from more than one teacher asking, Will we get our step increases?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=5360)|
| 1:29:25| Like, I'm willing to forego a 1%, 2%, 3%, 4% raise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=5365)|
| 1:29:31| I understand times are hard, but will we get our step?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=5371)|
| 1:29:34| So I will not be supporting this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=5374)|
| 1:29:36| because I think it speaks to a larger issue of our good faith effort as a system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=5376)|
| 1:29:44| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=5384)|
| 1:29:46| Thank you, Ms. Founds. Ms. Owen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=5386)|
| 1:29:48| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=5388)|
| 1:29:49| I agree with that good faith effort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=5389)|
| 1:29:52| When the PECA team, I happened to be on that first PECA team,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=5392)|
| 1:29:55| and when we first started talking about what we needed to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=5395)|
| 1:30:00| to make Knox County a place that teachers wanted to teach| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=5400)|
| 1:30:05| and to bring our pay in line with surrounding counties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=5405)|
| 1:30:11| we would have needed to increase pay by 20%, and that was in 2013.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=5411)|
| 1:30:17| So that 4% each year was so that we could maybe eventually catch up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=5417)|
| 1:30:24| with those surrounding counties and then figure out how to actually stay there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=5424)|
| 1:30:30| But we've only done that once.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=5430)|
| 1:30:32| So how far behind they already are is a significant consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=5432)|
| 1:30:47| If one group of people loses something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=5447)|
| 1:30:54| taking it from another group of people doesn't help the group that lost something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=5454)|
| 1:30:59| So I think looking at it that way might help some community members feel better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=5459)|
| 1:31:07| It doesn't improve their situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=5467)|
| 1:31:10| While if their neighbors do still have income,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=5470)|
| 1:31:14| their neighbors may be in a situation where they can help them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=5474)|
| 1:31:19| So that's something to look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=5479)|
| 1:31:23| Because if I can help family members who may not be working,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=5483)|
| 1:31:31| then that makes a difference in the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=5491)|
| 1:31:35| But if my salary is decreased to match what someone else's has been decreased,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=5495)|
| 1:31:43| then I can't help them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=5503)|
| 1:31:46| So all of those things have to work together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=5506)|
| 1:31:50| But the overall thing is we could decrease salaries a ton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=5510)|
| 1:31:57| It would be totally legal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=5517)|
| 1:31:59| But it doesn't help the people who are struggling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=5519)|
| 1:32:04| So I think that's the point that is very hard to get across to people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=5524)|
| 1:32:09| Yes, they are in a difficult situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=5529)|
| 1:32:14| But putting someone else in that same difficult situation isn't going to help them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=5534)|
| 1:32:19| So we need to figure out how to help those folks who need it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=5539)|
| 1:32:22| instead of bringing other people to match that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=5542)|
| 1:32:26| Mr. McMillan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=5546)|
| 1:32:28| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=5548)|
| 1:32:30| I understand that, Ms. Owen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=5550)|
| 1:32:33| But what I'm saying is that it's the public perception.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=5553)|
| 1:32:41| It's the perception when you see your neighbor get a raise and you're out of a job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=5561)|
| 1:32:50| Now, I'm sure they probably would help them if they thought they were really dire straits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=5570)|
| 1:32:57| But ordinarily they're not going to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=5577)|
| 1:33:01| What I was talking about was the perception that as a board that we send to the general public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=5581)|
| 1:33:11| Remember, we exist because the public pays the money with its state dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=5591)|
| 1:33:21| or local dollars for us to operate on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=5601)|
| 1:33:27| And the kids are the number one item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=5607)|
| 1:33:32| It's not, and since I was a teacher I can say this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=5612)|
| 1:33:37| it's not that we should protect teachers at all costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=5617)|
| 1:33:43| Every time when you hit a, I've supported as much as anybody,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=5623)|
| 1:33:50| but when you hit a one-time situation, then I think it calls for possibly other measures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=5630)|
| 1:34:00| That's all I'm saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=5640)|
| 1:34:02| I don't think it will go anywhere, but I just wanted to at least bring it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=5642)|
| 1:34:09| Madam Chair, I think it's important to differentiate between protecting teachers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=5649)|
| 1:34:15| and protecting the classrooms because what we're looking at is keeping our teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=5655)|
| 1:34:24| And if we're losing teachers and we're increasing class sizes, that's not good for students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=5664)|
| 1:34:33| It's the students that this protects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=5673)|
| 1:34:36| So anything we can do to ensure that we have staff in those classrooms,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=5676)|
| 1:34:43| we need to look at that because we can't have classrooms with nobody there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=5683)|
| 1:34:50| Do you really believe that $1,000 is going to keep somebody from taking that job,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=5690)|
| 1:34:59| taking their old job back?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=5699)|
| 1:35:01| I don't think it's going to keep somebody from taking a job,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=5701)|
| 1:35:05| but it certainly might be demeaning enough to cause someone to leave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=5705)|
| 1:35:10| Okay, thank you both for your comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=5710)|
| 1:35:12| I just wanted to make a couple of comments and then we'll have the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=5712)|
| 1:35:16| I agree with a lot of what's been said, and, Mr. McMillan, I think we all understand your point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=5716)|
| 1:35:23| I think that, as Ms. Bounds pointed out, partnerships are important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=5723)|
| 1:35:29| Our staff sees this as a part of their salary that they just haven't gotten yet, essentially.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=5729)|
| 1:35:34| And when you look at it, if I'm doing the math correctly, it's less than 1%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=5734)|
| 1:35:39| So it's very minuscule, but the goodwill that comes with it, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=5739)|
| 1:35:46| outweighs the possible negative optics of the fact that they got a minuscule step increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=5746)|
| 1:35:54| So in the scheme of things, $4 million in our budget is very small,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=5754)|
| 1:36:00| but it really does go a long way with teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=5760)|
| 1:36:03| And I think that, you know, it does goówe go in the opposite direction than we need to be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=5763)|
| 1:36:09| which is increasing salaries if we did not do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=5769)|
| 1:36:14| So I will not be supporting the amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=5774)|
| 1:36:18| And so with that, Ms. Coatney, if we can have the vote onó| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=5778)|
| 1:36:23| do we need to have Mr. McMillan restate the motion, or do you have it, Ms. Coatney?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=5783)|
| 1:36:33| I believe the motion was for an amendment to the original motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=5793)|
| 1:36:37| to drop step raises for certified employees, Mr. McMillan, and Ms. Siderfield seconded that motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=5797)|
| 1:36:42| So this vote would be on the amendment, correct, Mr. Dupre?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=5802)|
| 1:36:46| Okay, and we've had discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=5806)|
| 1:36:48| Okay, all in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=5808)|
| 1:36:51| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=5811)|
| 1:36:52| All opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=5812)|
| 1:36:54| Nay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=5814)|
| 1:36:56| Okay, and so motion fails 1, 2óor 1, 7, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=5816)|
| 1:37:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=5823)|
| 1:37:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=5824)|
| 1:37:05| Thank you foró| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=5825)|
| 1:37:07| A comment on the health insurance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=5827)|
| 1:37:10| How many employees take that insurance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=5830)|
| 1:37:13| How many of our employees?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=5833)|
| 1:37:15| Mr. Bolton, you want to take that one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=5835)|
| 1:37:22| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=5842)|
| 1:37:24| Ms. Hill, I believe it's somewhere in the neighborhood of aboutóin the 82 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=5844)|
| 1:37:28| We haven't ran those numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=5848)|
| 1:37:30| It's a constant flux, and our membership continues to grow in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=5850)|
| 1:37:35| So I think we're somewhere in the neighborhood of about 82 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=5855)|
| 1:37:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=5858)|
| 1:37:39| I can get those numbers and get them to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=5859)|
| 1:37:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=5861)|
| 1:37:42| I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=5862)|
| 1:37:47| As I know, the whole board did just get some kickback on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=5867)|
| 1:37:50| And, you know, I hate to say everybody probably is just going to have to feel a little bit of pain in all of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=5870)|
| 1:37:59| And that's one area that, again, I don't think there's a lot of alternative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=5879)|
| 1:38:08| However, I do hope that our teachers are hearing or reiterate what Mr. McPherson said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=5888)|
| 1:38:15| that we are very hopeful that by the time January rolls around,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=5895)|
| 1:38:20| that the amount of money that's currently not covered in the increase willóthat they'll be able to pick that up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=5900)|
| 1:38:28| Mr. Bolton?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=5908)|
| 1:38:30| I'm sorry, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=5910)|
| 1:38:31| I just wanted to say one more thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=5911)|
| 1:38:34| Our most expensive insurance coverage is the premier plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=5914)|
| 1:38:37| We do have a lower alternative to that, which is the standard plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=5917)|
| 1:38:41| So for those that have that issue of that 2 percent premium increase can drop to that lower plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=5921)|
| 1:38:47| And it's not a significant drop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=5927)|
| 1:38:48| You're talking about a 90 percent coinsurance down to an 80 percent coinsurance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=5928)|
| 1:38:53| But it can help kind of ease that transition if we're not able to overcome that employer match this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=5933)|
| 1:39:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=5941)|
| 1:39:02| Thank you for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=5942)|
| 1:39:03| Can I ask a follow-up to hers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=5943)|
| 1:39:05| What are we seeing if we're able to do that employer match?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=5945)|
| 1:39:09| I mean, I know we're not able to do it now, but now that we know that the insurance is down to 2 percent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=5949)|
| 1:39:14| what do we think the hit to our budget will be with that amount?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=5954)|
| 1:39:20| Do we know?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=5960)|
| 1:39:21| I thinkóJoe can correct me here if I'm wrongóI think we're looking at about between $150,000 to $200,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=5961)|
| 1:39:28| Total for the budget?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=5968)|
| 1:39:30| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=5970)|
| 1:39:31| Originallyóand this has just come in yesterday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=5971)|
| 1:39:34| This came in just yesterday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=5974)|
| 1:39:35| Originally we were sitting at about maybe a million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=5975)|
| 1:39:38| So when we got that yesterday, that was very encouraging.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=5978)|
| 1:39:42| So it's very hopeful if the economy can have a little bump so everybody goes spend money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=5982)|
| 1:39:47| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=5987)|
| 1:39:48| More hopeful now than it was just even two days ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=5988)|
| 1:39:51| No, that's very good news.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=5991)|
| 1:39:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=5992)|
| 1:39:53| It's amazing how fast your perspective can change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=5993)|
| 1:39:56| Yeah, right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=5996)|
| 1:39:58| Thank you, Mr. McPherson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=5998)|
| 1:40:01| The only other comment I haveóand I hope you'll appreciate the effort of just having a little humor in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=6001)|
| 1:40:15| Are we going to get lambasted with phone calls again from our teachers about not having copy paper this year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=6015)|
| 1:40:27| I mean I'm very serious with the cut in the amount of allotment to each school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=6027)|
| 1:40:38| I justóthat is suchóon the surface appears to be such a little thing, but it turned out to be huge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=6038)|
| 1:40:48| It turned out to be huge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=6048)|
| 1:40:49| So would you have any feel for that at all?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=6049)|
| 1:40:53| We use this word a lot, hopeful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=6053)|
| 1:40:58| What I can say is there, again, there is a considerable amount of dollars residing at the schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=6058)|
| 1:41:07| Not that they've mismanaged it or not used it when they should have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=6067)|
| 1:41:11| That's not what I'm saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=6071)|
| 1:41:12| But their hope is that a lot of this reduction can be supplemented with existing dollars on hand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=6072)|
| 1:41:20| They've also probably saved some, obviously, just through the closure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=6080)|
| 1:41:23| So we hope that doesn't happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=6083)|
| 1:41:28| It could, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=6088)|
| 1:41:30| And one more question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=6090)|
| 1:41:32| The actual cut of the 20 positions is what I'm hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=6092)|
| 1:41:39| Of those 20, do you have a feel for how many will actually walk out of here without a job| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=6099)|
| 1:41:49| as opposed to being absorbed into another position or reassigned because of retirement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=6109)|
| 1:41:55| We're still grappling with that because there are a few positions that I think departments are still trying to determine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=6115)|
| 1:42:05| For instance, system-wide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=6125)|
| 1:42:06| There are some system-wide positions that we just don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=6126)|
| 1:42:12| I hate to guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=6132)|
| 1:42:14| I'm going to say possibly half a dozen or maybe less.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=6134)|
| 1:42:18| But this is not finalized yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=6138)|
| 1:42:23| And I won't hold you to it, but my point is that is remarkable with 8,000 employees plus that if we can weather this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=6143)|
| 1:42:36| It's been a combination of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=6156)|
| 1:42:38| We've had some folks that are retiring, and as tough as it is, we're just going to take existing staff and make up the difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=6158)|
| 1:42:45| We have some positions that are approved but vacant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=6165)|
| 1:42:49| We're just not going to fill them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=6169)|
| 1:42:51| So we've tried to minimize that impact as much as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=6171)|
| 1:42:54| But the reality of it is it could genuinely affect folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=6174)|
| 1:43:03| And now we do have a handful where we've been able to creatively look at maybe grant dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=6183)|
| 1:43:08| We can move them into there because any time you cut, somebody's got to do the work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=6188)|
| 1:43:16| And I remember this was my first go-around here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=6196)|
| 1:43:21| It was probably 10 years or more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=6201)|
| 1:43:23| At one point, I had even my own department, I had cut it up to over the span of a few years, had cut it 20%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=6203)|
| 1:43:31| And so I began to lose employees because the workload was just too much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=6211)|
| 1:43:36| And so then I had to come back to the board and beg for more positions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=6216)|
| 1:43:40| So there is a point where you can overcut, and so we're really sensitive to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=6220)|
| 1:43:45| And so we don't believe that we're going to be in that position necessarily,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=6225)|
| 1:43:49| but we do know that we're going to have to grit our teeth and get after it a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=6229)|
| 1:43:55| Well, thank you really.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=6235)|
| 1:43:58| I do think that's remarkable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=6238)|
| 1:44:00| And just in closing, again, back to Ms. Owens' point about where the lack of funding overall may tend to come from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=6240)|
| 1:44:12| and the planning ahead, it would do us no good at this point, in my opinion, to not pass this budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=6252)|
| 1:44:20| We could certainly ask for more money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=6260)|
| 1:44:23| but we will be giving it to our funding body who is facing the very same issues and problems that we are facing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=6263)|
| 1:44:32| So the truth of the matter is they don't have it either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=6272)|
| 1:44:36| So to do anything different really would just be futile at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=6276)|
| 1:44:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=6284)|
| 1:44:46| Thank you, Ms. Jones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=6286)|
| 1:44:47| Ms. Patterfield?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=6287)|
| 1:44:48| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=6288)|
| 1:44:49| First I want to start off with saying thank you for reallocating the $1.1 million to the priority schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=6289)|
| 1:44:58| That is crucial for those priority schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=6298)|
| 1:45:01| And I want the board to think about that as we move forward in the coming years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=6301)|
| 1:45:09| If that reallocation doesn't exist, the importance of funding those schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=6309)|
| 1:45:15| I was elected by District 1, but I serve Knox County schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=6315)|
| 1:45:19| I sit on this board and serve all of Knox County schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=6319)|
| 1:45:22| And so when we're not fully supporting the schools that rank the lowest, that's a ding on Knox County schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=6322)|
| 1:45:32| And that, while it brings District 1 down, it brings Knox County schools down as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=6332)|
| 1:45:38| So I just want us to be mindful of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=6338)|
| 1:45:42| I want to represent an excellent school system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=6342)|
| 1:45:45| I want Knox County schools to be the number one school system in the state of Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=6345)|
| 1:45:49| and make our way to the number one school system in the United States.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=6349)|
| 1:45:52| And we only do that by supporting the schools that need it the most.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=6352)|
| 1:45:56| So thank you for finding the funding this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=6356)|
| 1:45:59| And I want the board to remember that as we move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=6359)|
| 1:46:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=6363)|
| 1:46:05| I want to go back and revisit the Magnet conversation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=6365)|
| 1:46:09| because we did receive, within the last 24 hours, over 160 emails from community members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=6369)|
| 1:46:16| Yes, it was yesterday, and Terry was overwhelmed, I know, and I apologize, Terry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=6376)|
| 1:46:23| But that probably has something to do with the budget being published on Friday on a three-day weekend,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=6383)|
| 1:46:28| and they're just now catching it and seeing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=6388)|
| 1:46:32| It has been said multiple times that this money is not attached to positions, but it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=6392)|
| 1:46:39| This money is attached to positions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=6399)|
| 1:46:42| And when I think about our Magnet schools, I wasn't on the board when we were at this place before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=6402)|
| 1:46:51| but three years ago, Magnet was on the chopping block, and people spoke up about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=6411)|
| 1:46:57| So I'm not really understanding, and feel free to enlighten me why Magnet continues to come up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=6417)|
| 1:47:02| when it's such a small amount of money in the bigger picture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=6422)|
| 1:47:08| So feel free to enlighten me on that, season board members, on why it continues to come up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=6428)|
| 1:47:12| But when we think about the two schools that got recognized from the national level this year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=6432)|
| 1:47:18| they're our Magnet schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=6438)|
| 1:47:20| Beaumont, we were all together taking pictures with Mr. Frank Beaumont.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=6440)|
| 1:47:26| What's that man's name?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=6446)|
| 1:47:27| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=6447)|
| 1:47:28| U.S. Assistant Secretary of Education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=6448)|
| 1:47:31| We were all together smiling and excited at Beaumont.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=6451)|
| 1:47:34| They're able to do that because of the Magnet funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=6454)|
| 1:47:39| LNN STEM Academy has been the forerunner of Knox County Schools since its inception.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=6459)|
| 1:47:46| They're knocking it out the park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=6466)|
| 1:47:48| That is a model school that people from across the nation looks at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=6468)|
| 1:47:53| We have that in our Knox County school system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=6473)|
| 1:47:56| And for us to deliberately cut, and I get the 50% cut across the board, I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=6476)|
| 1:48:03| But when you look deeper, that cuts from our top schools that got national recognition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=6483)|
| 1:48:09| It does not make sense to me for us to let this budget, the downsides of this budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=6489)|
| 1:48:21| overshadow the academic excellence that we're getting from LNN and Beaumont,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=6501)|
| 1:48:25| and our other Magnet schools, and all of our schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=6505)|
| 1:48:27| But these two schools got specific attention this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=6507)|
| 1:48:31| And I think we're forgetting that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=6511)|
| 1:48:33| So I'm here to remind you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=6513)|
| 1:48:35| Then also, LNN is number nine in the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=6515)|
| 1:48:39| If you cut this part of the budget, which is, we just had a conversation about the raises.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=6519)|
| 1:48:46| Four million is a very small number, I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=6526)|
| 1:48:49| 120,000 is an even smaller number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=6529)|
| 1:48:52| That's pennies that will definitely hurt our top achievement school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=6532)|
| 1:48:58| and one of our top achievement schools in Knox County schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=6538)|
| 1:49:01| So really think past what's presented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=6541)|
| 1:49:09| And you're hearing emotion from me because I'm literally having to advocate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=6549)|
| 1:49:17| for $1.2 million out of this budget for our priority schools and our Magnet program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=6557)|
| 1:49:24| And I don't understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=6564)|
| 1:49:26| I really don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=6566)|
| 1:49:30| And so I will need some more explanation as we move forward with this budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=6570)|
| 1:49:34| But I will, if we need suggestions on where to find the 120,000, because I'm all about solutions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=6574)|
| 1:49:41| we add it to the budget, so increase the budget by $120,000 and put that through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=6581)|
| 1:49:47| Identify central office positions that can be a limit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=6587)|
| 1:49:50| 120,000 is two positions or one position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=6590)|
| 1:49:54| Or we can look at the athletic budget that was only cut by 4%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=6594)|
| 1:49:58| With COVID being rampant, we don't even know if athletics is going to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=6598)|
| 1:50:02| So we can find 120,000 from that budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=6602)|
| 1:50:06| So those are just the solutions that I recommend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=6606)|
| 1:50:09| Nowhere near a budget mastermind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=6609)|
| 1:50:12| So if there's other places that we can find 120,000, that would be great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=6612)|
| 1:50:16| But I think we're going to do more harm to our schools that are getting national recognition by cutting this 120,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=6616)|
| 1:50:25| So I would like to make a motion to pass the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=6625)|
| 1:50:29| I would like to make a motion to add the $120,000 back to the magnet fund into this budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=6629)|
| 1:50:36| I'll second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=6636)|
| 1:50:39| Okay. Do we have discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=6639)|
| 1:50:47| I guess I have a question for Mr. McPherson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=6647)|
| 1:50:52| You know, I don't want any of the cuts, obviously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=6652)|
| 1:51:00| I mean, you know, nothing wants to be cut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=6660)|
| 1:51:02| But 120,000 is not a lot of money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=6662)|
| 1:51:05| If we did something like that, how would 120,000 – I mean, could we just present a budget $120,000 higher?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=6665)|
| 1:51:14| Or are we going to have to find a $120,000 cut somewhere?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=6674)|
| 1:51:17| I mean, it would be preferable if we could identify the – and, you know, I will say, you know, none of these cuts are pleasant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=6677)|
| 1:51:26| So for L&N, you know, I think we're looking at – what it would amount to them would be 15 – make sure I'm saying this right – $15,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=6686)|
| 1:51:34| They would receive $15,000 less this year than what they've gotten – next year than what they've gotten this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=6694)|
| 1:51:42| They probably have about 12,000 on hand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=6702)|
| 1:51:45| Well, I was going to say, Ron, if you'd let me – can I?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=6705)|
| 1:51:47| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=6707)|
| 1:51:48| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=6708)|
| 1:51:49| Just looking at L&M, I think they had almost $10,000 of their allocation this year unspent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=6709)|
| 1:51:55| So if we cut it 50 percent, they were getting 30, so they'll get 15.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=6715)|
| 1:52:00| So 15 and 10 is 25.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=6720)|
| 1:52:02| So if we supplemented them $5,000, they would be back to $30,000 for this coming year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=6722)|
| 1:52:09| And Beaumont had – they spent more money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=6729)|
| 1:52:11| They had about $2,000 remaining in their allocation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=6731)|
| 1:52:16| So if we supplemented them 15, they'd get them to 17.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=6736)|
| 1:52:20| Then they would need $13,000 to be made whole, if you will, to be back to $30,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=6740)|
| 1:52:26| So I think – and, Joe, you help me if I'm wrong on this, but we looked at it this morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=6746)|
| 1:52:31| For $30,000, based on every magnet school that's got an account left, for $30,000 more, we make them whole for this next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=6751)|
| 1:52:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=6761)|
| 1:52:42| So, I mean, that's a possible solution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=6762)|
| 1:52:45| So what you're saying, instead of having to do 120,000, because they've got money on hand –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=6765)|
| 1:52:50| and this is not just looking at the two schools, it's looking at all the magnet programs –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=6770)|
| 1:52:55| $30,000 with what they've still got on hand, plus the money they would get, would make them whole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=6775)|
| 1:53:02| For this coming year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=6782)|
| 1:53:03| For this coming year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=6783)|
| 1:53:05| I guess I'm – which is obviously a lot more palatable to $30,000 added to the budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=6785)|
| 1:53:12| but obviously I didn't make the amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=6792)|
| 1:53:14| So, I mean, I totally – I want everybody to be happy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=6794)|
| 1:53:20| But you've got a different amendment on the floor, so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=6800)|
| 1:53:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=6804)|
| 1:53:25| Did you want to respond to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=6805)|
| 1:53:26| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=6806)|
| 1:53:27| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=6807)|
| 1:53:28| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=6808)|
| 1:53:29| Yes, I hear that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=6809)|
| 1:53:30| I'm coming from a perspective of I hear what you say, but I see what you do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=6810)|
| 1:53:34| Three years ago, magnet was on the chopping block.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=6814)|
| 1:53:37| So once we chop this and cut this budget, we never – it's hard to build that budget back in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=6817)|
| 1:53:42| We just had that full conversation about steps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=6822)|
| 1:53:44| And so with us cutting – and I appreciate you, Board Member Babb, for trying to find that middle ground.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=6824)|
| 1:53:52| But once this is cut, it continues to be cut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=6832)|
| 1:53:55| It never stays the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=6835)|
| 1:53:56| We were – the Board of Education for Knox County Schools was here three years ago with the same type of cut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=6836)|
| 1:54:02| So my fear is that we cut it now, then it stays at that level, and we continue to cut, and it no longer exists.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=6842)|
| 1:54:08| And LNN no longer is the number one innovation school of the nation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=6848)|
| 1:54:14| They're down at the bottom as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=6854)|
| 1:54:16| That's my fear with making this cut today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=6856)|
| 1:54:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=6861)|
| 1:54:23| And I think – I'll turn it to Ms. Owen, but I think that part of the point is that Ms. Owen stated earlier that we've had cuts in so many places.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=6863)|
| 1:54:33| I think that plays into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=6873)|
| 1:54:34| I think we have – I don't have the figures with me, but if you look at spending by district, that kind of plays into some of that conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=6874)|
| 1:54:43| So, anyway, Ms. Owen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=6883)|
| 1:54:47| I would like to – what I need to say and what I want to say are different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=6887)|
| 1:54:56| I want to caution us against going through and looking at advocating for each small piece because the allocations that we're looking at are $400,000, unless I'm mistaken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=6896)|
| 1:55:17| So if I want to go and say, but look at the instrumental music department, it's just $11,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=6917)|
| 1:55:23| And look at the choral music department, it's just $13,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=6923)|
| 1:55:27| And by the time we go through those allocations and look at these things that we really need, then we're $400,000 down again and we have to find somewhere else to cut it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=6927)|
| 1:55:42| There's a page somewhere in here that compares something that's not really comparable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=6942)|
| 1:55:53| It compares these departmental budgets and looks at the percentage of the total.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=6953)|
| 1:55:59| But some of the departmental budgets have a very tiny allocation and a huge amount in personnel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=6959)|
| 1:56:08| And so it's not really accurate to compare those things when we're looking at keeping personnel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=6968)|
| 1:56:15| So looking at it that way, I think it may be that we need to look more carefully at all of the pieces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=6975)|
| 1:56:31| Because if we try to drill down into each thing that we want to keep, we want to keep everything here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=6991)|
| 1:56:39| So it's a very, I really hate that term slippery slope, but that's what it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=6999)|
| 1:56:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=7007)|
| 1:56:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=7008)|
| 1:56:49| Ms. Satterfield?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=7009)|
| 1:56:50| Yes, kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=7010)|
| 1:56:51| I don't, I can't see past that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=7011)|
| 1:56:54| I can't see past this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=7014)|
| 1:56:57| This is the money that goes towards creating the innovation that I want for all of our schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=7017)|
| 1:57:04| I can't wait until the day that everybody has that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=7024)|
| 1:57:07| And yes, it might be in my district, District 1, but Beaumont and L&N, they pull from kids all over this district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=7027)|
| 1:57:13| Magnet Program, Magnet Schools pull from kids all over this district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=7033)|
| 1:57:17| And if we don't treat our Magnet Schools like they're supposed to be treated, then what's the point of having an open transfer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=7037)|
| 1:57:24| What's the point of all this, the innovation that Knox County provides to students if we're not fully supporting the innovation that's in our schools?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=7044)|
| 1:57:33| L&N has done exactly what we want our high schools to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=7053)|
| 1:57:37| Beaumont has done exactly what we want our Magnet Program to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=7057)|
| 1:57:41| Cutting it by pennies of $120,000 is not a good faith effort or goodwill that we're, that we said we're doing because we have partners or whatever it may be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=7061)|
| 1:57:54| The good faith effort is to keep the Magnet funding for our Magnet Schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=7074)|
| 1:57:59| And we can call for the question, unless there's...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=7079)|
| 1:58:02| Well, I just have a comment to make first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=7082)|
| 1:58:04| I'm bothered by the decrease in supplies across the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=7084)|
| 1:58:08| So, but my issue with the Magnet is that that's funding that's over and above anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=7088)|
| 1:58:15| So, you know, the schools in my district don't get that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=7095)|
| 1:58:19| And so if Bob's saying that we're only $30,000 from making those budgets what they were last year, then that means that those schools would get an increase in their budget this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=7099)|
| 1:58:33| So they would get, if $120,000 minus $30,000 is $90,000, that means they would get a $90,000 increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=7113)|
| 1:58:40| Meanwhile, the rest of our schools and everybody else is all, what do we have, 15 Magnet Schools?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=7120)|
| 1:58:46| So all the other schools would get a decrease and they would get an increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=7126)|
| 1:58:51| So I can't support that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=7131)|
| 1:58:52| I don't want any of our, I don't want to, I don't want the Magnet Schools, I don't want them to have any kind of cut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=7132)|
| 1:58:58| And I don't want any of our budgets to have cuts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=7138)|
| 1:59:02| I specifically, I've made note of every single cut of how much it is, specifically with the music and the art.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=7142)|
| 1:59:09| So that bothers me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=7149)|
| 1:59:11| I've emailed Ron and Joe and Bob, and so they already know how much I'm bothered by that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=7151)|
| 1:59:17| But it's not fair for Magnet to get an, well, but it's not, it would be, so it would be getting a,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=7157)|
| 1:59:27| if they would be getting an increase, meanwhile, all the other schools would be getting a decrease.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=7167)|
| 1:59:33| So I can't support that amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=7173)|
| 1:59:36| So the same increase that we're giving to the step raises and the decrease that everyone else is getting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=7176)|
| 1:59:42| I hear you and I get that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=7182)|
| 1:59:45| We can do whatever we want to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=7185)|
| 1:59:47| Just know that 161 people commented and emailed the board within less than 24 hours about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=7187)|
| 1:59:55| I get the conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=7195)|
| 1:59:57| I promise you I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=7197)|
| 1:59:59| The funding that goes into these schools, the increase that you're saying is going to come to these schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=7199)|
| 2:00:04| are the reason why we get national recognition for Knox County Schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=7204)|
| 2:00:08| And that's just really what it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=7208)|
| 2:00:10| I want to be a part of excellence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=7210)|
| 2:00:12| I represent excellence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=7212)|
| 2:00:14| We have excellence in our schools, and we have high expectations for our kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=7214)|
| 2:00:18| Excellence comes with funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=7218)|
| 2:00:20| So, yes, there's an increase, and that's what you get with excellence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=7220)|
| 2:00:24| There's only $30,000 to get them to their current budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=7224)|
| 2:00:27| I hear you, and I do, Susan, and we can call for the question and just be done with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=7227)|
| 2:00:33| But once it's cut, it's cut, and you know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=7233)|
| 2:00:36| Once it's cut, it's cut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=7236)|
| 2:00:38| Next year, it's going to be zero.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=7238)|
| 2:00:40| I mean, my plan for next year is to have this sheet of paper that has all the cuts on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=7240)|
| 2:00:44| and we look at those first, and we see what do we need to add back for everything, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=7244)|
| 2:00:50| not for that, but for everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=7250)|
| 2:00:53| And I appreciate you advocating for your district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=7253)|
| 2:00:55| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=7255)|
| 2:00:56| It's Knox County Schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=7256)|
| 2:00:57| L&M is not its own district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=7257)|
| 2:00:59| They pull from everywhere, and so does Beaumont.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=7259)|
| 2:01:01| It's everybody's district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=7261)|
| 2:01:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=7263)|
| 2:01:04| So, any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=7264)|
| 2:01:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=7266)|
| 2:01:07| All in favor of the amendment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=7267)|
| 2:01:10| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=7270)|
| 2:01:11| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=7271)|
| 2:01:12| And all opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=7272)|
| 2:01:14| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=7274)|
| 2:01:15| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=7275)|
| 2:01:16| Okay, so we have two to five motion fails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=7276)|
| 2:01:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=7279)|
| 2:01:20| And, Ms. Babb, do you have a question on the original motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=7280)|
| 2:01:23| I'm back to the original.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=7283)|
| 2:01:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=7285)|
| 2:01:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=7286)|
| 2:01:27| I am, I want to get back to Ms. Owen's earlier comment, because I'm not, you know, none of us are happy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=7287)|
| 2:01:34| I mean, we're all unhappy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=7294)|
| 2:01:35| I think everybody needs to think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=7295)|
| 2:01:37| We have got, and I've brought this up before, and I know Ron's going to be like, oh, God, here she goes again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=7297)|
| 2:01:44| But we have to present a realistic budget, because the money is what it is, and it's bad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=7304)|
| 2:01:52| But we have got to show our mayor and our county commissioners why we are so bad off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=7312)|
| 2:02:00| And a lot of it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=7320)|
| 2:02:01| I mean, speech pathologists, they are, the state is funding us zero speech pathologists.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=7321)|
| 2:02:07| We are paying for 63.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=7327)|
| 2:02:09| I mean, things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=7329)|
| 2:02:10| I mean, the state doesn't pay for a finance department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=7330)|
| 2:02:14| Guess what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=7334)|
| 2:02:15| We've got to have you guys figuring this stuff out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=7335)|
| 2:02:17| I mean, it is costing us a lot of money to fund our school system at any level of even where we're trying to get more excellent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=7337)|
| 2:02:26| And I think there's two things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=7346)|
| 2:02:28| There's the state level that we have got to keep going back to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=7348)|
| 2:02:31| And I had a community member contact me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=7351)|
| 2:02:33| How do I help you on the state?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=7353)|
| 2:02:34| And Jennifer's probably better at this than I am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=7354)|
| 2:02:36| But the one thing I say is, you know, it gets down to, like, their ratios.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=7356)|
| 2:02:40| I mean, it just does not fully support our community and the way we want to teach our children the way the state is funding us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=7360)|
| 2:02:48| And we have got to continually go back to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=7368)|
| 2:02:51| But then on the local level, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=7371)|
| 2:02:53| I mean, our property taxes, I think Mr. McMillan talked about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=7373)|
| 2:02:58| I mean, somebody did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=7378)|
| 2:02:59| Our property tax is actually one of our speakers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=7379)|
| 2:03:02| Our property tax has not gone up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=7382)|
| 2:03:04| There is room in the sales tax to go up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=7384)|
| 2:03:07| We are in dire conditions that we have got to get more revenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=7387)|
| 2:03:11| And it is not just a schools issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=7391)|
| 2:03:13| This is a community issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=7393)|
| 2:03:15| It is about our, you know, it's about our road systems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=7395)|
| 2:03:19| It's about our sheriffs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=7399)|
| 2:03:20| It's about our health department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=7400)|
| 2:03:22| And that's what I've tried to explain to people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=7402)|
| 2:03:24| If we ask for more this year, we're taking away from someone else in our community because the pie is not getting any bigger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=7404)|
| 2:03:30| And, actually, this year it has shrunk dramatically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=7410)|
| 2:03:33| And so we have got to work on, as a community, how to make this pie bigger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=7413)|
| 2:03:37| And I really hope that we will show the mayor and the county commissioners where we are making the cuts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=7417)|
| 2:03:44| not only from where we thought we were going to be in March, but even in March was not where we wanted to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=7424)|
| 2:03:50| We were still not at the mental health workers that we wanted, still not at the nurses that we wanted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=7430)|
| 2:03:56| And, honestly, I mean, I fully support the one-to-one effort that we're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=7436)|
| 2:04:00| But there is no way our tech support is going to be able to fully support it the way it needs to be supported to fully do it the way we need to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=7440)|
| 2:04:07| And we need to be showing them we're going to limp by, and we do, and we band-aid it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=7447)|
| 2:04:12| And, I mean, I think you all do better than anybody I know with band-aids and stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=7452)|
| 2:04:16| But we're really limping by, and we have got to show them, okay, we're being realistic on our budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=7456)|
| 2:04:22| We know it's dire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=7462)|
| 2:04:23| We are, you know, pulling in our belts and stuff like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=7463)|
| 2:04:27| But we, to be the excellent school system that everybody wants us to be, that we all want it to be, we have got to have more funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=7467)|
| 2:04:34| And I just hope that we can really show that to the county commission while giving them a realistic budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=7474)|
| 2:04:41| I mean, this year we've got to ask for what we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=7481)|
| 2:04:43| It's bad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=7483)|
| 2:04:44| We all know it's bad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=7484)|
| 2:04:45| But, you know, we want to fund teachers better than just the step increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=7485)|
| 2:04:49| I mean, we want to do everything that's in this budget and even not in the original budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=7489)|
| 2:04:53| But I'm just really calling for, I hope that we can sort of show that when we go to the county commission in a nice, gentle way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=7493)|
| 2:05:00| You know, I mean, you know, we've got to work with them on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=7500)|
| 2:05:03| But we've got to point out where we're not funding correctly in the future to start getting us where we need to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=7503)|
| 2:05:10| Because it's really evident when we've got a crisis how bad things are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=7510)|
| 2:05:15| So that's my little speech.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=7515)|
| 2:05:19| Ms. Christine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=7519)|
| 2:05:21| I just have a comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=7521)|
| 2:05:22| I have a comment and a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=7522)|
| 2:05:25| I'm not feeling overly confident that we're going to get these positions back in magnet right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=7525)|
| 2:05:31| I would hope that we would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=7531)|
| 2:05:34| And my next question is about the aspiring principal program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=7534)|
| 2:05:38| How much money are we spending on that exactly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=7538)|
| 2:05:42| Do we know?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=7542)|
| 2:05:44| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=7544)|
| 2:05:45| Well, on the aspiring principals, Mr. McPherson, too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=7545)|
| 2:05:48| I think there's, what, $26,000 or $7,000 budgeted for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=7548)|
| 2:05:52| And we can certainly put that on hold for this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=7552)|
| 2:05:57| So that would help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=7557)|
| 2:05:58| And let me just say, you know, back to what I said about magnet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=7558)|
| 2:06:02| We're going to do, we'll do what I said we would do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=7562)|
| 2:06:05| and make sure that they're put back to the level of funding that they had this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=7565)|
| 2:06:13| You know, and I understand what Ms. Satterfield is saying, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=7573)|
| 2:06:18| You know, and then next year, look, I'm for putting it back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=7578)|
| 2:06:21| The $70 million we send to other school districts for sales taxes and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=7581)|
| 2:06:28| So, yeah, I'm for all of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=7588)|
| 2:06:30| But I just want you to know we are committed to magnet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=7590)|
| 2:06:33| And you're right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=7593)|
| 2:06:34| I mean, L&N is a star.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=7594)|
| 2:06:36| Beaumont is a star.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=7596)|
| 2:06:37| All of our magnet schools do a really good job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=7597)|
| 2:06:40| So I'll make a commitment, too, that, hey, we'll put that back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=7600)|
| 2:06:44| And we did not intend to cut anything that was funding for positions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=7604)|
| 2:06:49| I mean, gosh, when was it, back in early April or March, I said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=7609)|
| 2:06:52| we're not going to cut schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=7612)|
| 2:06:55| We're just not going to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=7615)|
| 2:06:56| We'll find it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=7616)|
| 2:06:57| You know, if we have to have nobody left in this building, that's what it will be so we can have schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=7617)|
| 2:07:02| I don't know how we'd do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=7622)|
| 2:07:04| But, you know, this thing started out, it was a train wreck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=7624)|
| 2:07:08| It's still right now is a major car wreck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=7628)|
| 2:07:12| But it was a train wreck a couple of months ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=7632)|
| 2:07:15| So I just want you to understand, and you're right, Ms. Horne, too, you know, I've sweated, I've grieved over this budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=7635)|
| 2:07:25| what we do to our employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=7645)|
| 2:07:27| You know, my whole goal was to move this school district forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=7647)|
| 2:07:30| You know, and this year we're taking a step backwards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=7650)|
| 2:07:33| And I don't like it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=7653)|
| 2:07:37| Unfortunately, I can't do anything about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=7657)|
| 2:07:39| You know, $20 million would have helped us back in March.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=7659)|
| 2:07:43| But everybody's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=7663)|
| 2:07:46| Ms. Babb said, you know, we need $40 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=7666)|
| 2:07:49| That's what we were looking for when we first started, $40 million, to try to help us get to that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=7669)|
| 2:07:55| So, you know, look at the swing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=7675)|
| 2:07:57| But, you know, we'll do what I said we'll do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=7677)|
| 2:08:01| We'll make sure that the magnet schools get what they need in order to perform this next year like they performed this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=7681)|
| 2:08:09| So I'm committed to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=7689)|
| 2:08:10| And I think, Joe, and you help me if I'm wrong on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=7690)|
| 2:08:15| but we looked at the total school allocations that were left out there in the schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=7695)|
| 2:08:22| And, you know, good financial management to the credit of the schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=7702)|
| 2:08:27| But there, let's see, there was $259,000 left in school allocations out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=7707)|
| 2:08:39| So for another $30,000, we can restore those allocations to put them back to where they were.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=7719)|
| 2:08:47| So for $60,000, you know, we can make the school allocations what they were for this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=7727)|
| 2:08:55| So, you know, in $60,000, you know, finding any money is going to be hard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=7735)|
| 2:08:59| But finding $60,000 is a lot easier than, you know, finding hundreds of thousands, obviously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=7739)|
| 2:09:05| So I didn't mean to get on a soapbox, too, with the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=7745)|
| 2:09:10| But you all are all right, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=7750)|
| 2:09:12| Gosh, and I've been, you know, you know how long I've been here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=7752)|
| 2:09:15| I've been here 47 years plus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=7755)|
| 2:09:17| So 30 years in this position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=7757)|
| 2:09:19| So, you know, I've seen about everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=7759)|
| 2:09:22| I have to admit, what I saw this year I've never seen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=7762)|
| 2:09:24| I hope to never see that again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=7764)|
| 2:09:26| But, you know, we're going to do everything we can to treat our students like they needed to be treated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=7766)|
| 2:09:31| and give them the very best, you know, from an educational opportunity standpoint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=7771)|
| 2:09:35| And our teachers, Lord have mercy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=7775)|
| 2:09:38| You know, and our principals, they work so hard every day for our students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=7778)|
| 2:09:42| And, you know, it just kills me to not be able to do any more than we're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=7782)|
| 2:09:47| And I, you know, Scott, you can help me with this, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=7787)|
| 2:09:50| But I think on the TEA survey that came out, our teacher pay was, we were like 31st, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=7790)|
| 2:09:56| You know, out of all the school districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=7796)|
| 2:09:58| 31st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=7798)|
| 2:09:59| We've not made hardly any ground now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=7799)|
| 2:10:01| What that doesn't consider is the 4% raise we got last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=7801)|
| 2:10:04| So, hopefully, maybe we moved up a little bit, you know, with that 4%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=7804)|
| 2:10:08| But, you know, our teachers, they deserve better than 31st in the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=7808)|
| 2:10:14| You know, we're, what, third largest school district, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=7814)|
| 2:10:18| We're probably the first in terms of board pay or up to the top.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=7818)|
| 2:10:23| You know, I'm fourth in pay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=7823)|
| 2:10:25| Our teachers deserve to be up there, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=7825)|
| 2:10:28| They need to be, you know, I'd love to be third or fourth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=7828)|
| 2:10:30| But, unfortunately, we don't compete with Alcoa.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=7830)|
| 2:10:32| We don't compete with Maryville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=7832)|
| 2:10:34| We don't compete with Oak Ridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=7834)|
| 2:10:36| And just, you know, we had a principal left just recently, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=7836)|
| 2:10:40| and we got, what, Ms. Christie, $14,000, $15,000 raise for driving 15 miles or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=7840)|
| 2:10:49| So, you know, we can't compete with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=7849)|
| 2:10:51| So, again, I haven't said much tonight, so I apologize for getting on my soapbox.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=7851)|
| 2:10:56| But just wanted to let you know we're going to do everything we can to make this right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=7856)|
| 2:11:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=7861)|
| 2:11:02| Thank you so much, Mr. Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=7862)|
| 2:11:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=7864)|
| 2:11:05| What other questions or comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=7865)|
| 2:11:06| Ms. Owen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=7866)|
| 2:11:08| I have some math questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=7868)|
| 2:11:12| Well, I made a commitment to myself not to do math in public anymore,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=7872)|
| 2:11:17| but I'm looking at what Ms. Babb was looking at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=7877)|
| 2:11:22| And I used a calculator.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=7882)|
| 2:11:26| Looking at the BEP formula and the KCS total, the difference there is 1,585.6 positions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=7886)|
| 2:11:35| So, 24% of our staff not funded in the BEP at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=7895)|
| 2:11:39| And that doesn't sound like a lot, except that 76% that is funded, that's not funded fully.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=7899)|
| 2:11:48| Is it 72% of or is it lower?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=7908)|
| 2:11:51| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=7911)|
| 2:11:52| 72% of the 76%?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=7912)|
| 2:11:55| I'm thinking it's less.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=7915)|
| 2:11:56| 60.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=7916)|
| 2:11:57| 60?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=7917)|
| 2:11:58| So, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=7918)|
| 2:11:59| So what it means, I very much appreciate you making this point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=7919)|
| 2:12:03| because what you see there, the 49.49, it's really 60% of that cost is what we receive from the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=7923)|
| 2:12:14| So the state funds 60% of, I hope I said this right, Joe, 75% of our people or something like that, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=7934)|
| 2:12:23| I'm just rounding it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=7943)|
| 2:12:24| So the state funds 60% of 75% of our teachers, right, or are certified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=7944)|
| 2:12:31| And then locally we have to fund the remaining 40% of that 75% and 100% of the 25%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=7951)|
| 2:12:40| Yes, so it actually, as bad as it looks on paper, the reality of it is it's even worse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=7960)|
| 2:12:47| And BEP used to fund significantly more, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=7967)|
| 2:12:53| Well, not necessarily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=7973)|
| 2:12:56| I mean, at least in the 20 years that I've looked at this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=7976)|
| 2:12:59| I remember, I will say 20 years ago, when Mr. Thomas was in the position I'm in now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=7979)|
| 2:13:08| he had me break down, I just remember this because it was staggering to me when I saw it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=7988)|
| 2:13:15| to break down actual funding on a per-people basis from the state versus the other 135 school districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=7995)|
| 2:13:22| And I remember that time because I remember we were 136.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=8002)|
| 2:13:27| And a lot of that comes in at that fiscal capacity formula.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=8007)|
| 2:13:31| I don't think we're dead last now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=8011)|
| 2:13:33| We still have folks, Joe's got some folks that take a look at that for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=8013)|
| 2:13:38| I'm thinking we've probably made a little bit of ground.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=8018)|
| 2:13:41| I'm going to say we've probably moved up about three or four spots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=8021)|
| 2:13:44| It's still lousy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=8024)|
| 2:13:45| Is the 60% based on fiscal capacity?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=8025)|
| 2:13:49| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=8029)|
| 2:13:50| Yes, that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=8030)|
| 2:13:51| And so the fiscal capacity component basically just boils down to the state looks at a district's ability to fund education on its own| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=8031)|
| 2:14:04| or with its own resources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=8044)|
| 2:14:05| It does not look at what's actually happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=8045)|
| 2:14:09| It looks at the district's or the county's ability to do what they do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=8049)|
| 2:14:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=8055)|
| 2:14:17| And I'll just point out that every January this board meets with our state legislators.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=8057)|
| 2:14:23| And this year we specifically went through all of these numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=8063)|
| 2:14:27| And I'll give you another fact that I remember from that meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=8067)|
| 2:14:31| Knox County has 6% of the state's students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=8071)|
| 2:14:34| We have 4.5% of the state's budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=8074)|
| 2:14:36| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=8076)|
| 2:14:37| So that's $70 million every single year that goes to other districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=8077)|
| 2:14:44| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=8084)|
| 2:14:45| To other districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=8085)|
| 2:14:46| So that's significant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=8086)|
| 2:14:47| $70 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=8087)|
| 2:14:48| Look at the numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=8088)|
| 2:14:49| We just wish we could find $40 million and that's $70.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=8089)|
| 2:14:53| So anyway, it's significant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=8093)|
| 2:14:54| Ms. Satterfield?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=8094)|
| 2:14:55| Can you speak to that a little bit on what changes to make that change?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=8095)|
| 2:14:59| I don't know if you know or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=8099)|
| 2:15:01| What will need to happen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=8101)|
| 2:15:03| Mr. McPherson could probably speak to more of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=8103)|
| 2:15:05| But it goes back to the BEP allocations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=8105)|
| 2:15:08| And so if you look at this last page that Ms. Babb pointed out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=8108)|
| 2:15:12| all of these places that are not funded through the BEP,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=8112)|
| 2:15:18| and then in addition to the fiscal capacity to pay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=8118)|
| 2:15:22| which we'll let him talk about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=8122)|
| 2:15:24| I guess my question is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=8124)|
| 2:15:25| what needs to be done to maintain that $70 million in our district?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=8125)|
| 2:15:30| Well, it fundamentally speaks to the methodology behind the BEP| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=8130)|
| 2:15:34| and the philosophy behind the BEP formula.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=8134)|
| 2:15:37| So I think it would actually take law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=8137)|
| 2:15:41| And I was going to say, Shelby County and Nashville Metro,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=8141)|
| 2:15:45| they have lawsuits against the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=8145)|
| 2:15:46| Okay, so that's part of the law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=8146)|
| 2:15:47| That's part of that lawsuit, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=8147)|
| 2:15:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=8148)|
| 2:15:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=8149)|
| 2:15:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=8150)|
| 2:15:51| Ms. Owen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=8151)|
| 2:15:52| It also came from a lawsuit many years ago from funding counties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=8152)|
| 2:15:58| And it's really easy to look at it and say, well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=8158)|
| 2:16:01| if we just give them the money, they're not going to try.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=8161)|
| 2:16:03| But if we look at, let's say we look at Morgan County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=8163)|
| 2:16:06| which is largely federal land,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=8166)|
| 2:16:09| they don't have the property tax base that we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=8169)|
| 2:16:12| But their community members shop in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=8172)|
| 2:16:16| So looking at that kind of capacity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=8176)|
| 2:16:20| we are getting sales tax from counties that don't have the same kind of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=8180)|
| 2:16:28| infrastructure that we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=8188)|
| 2:16:30| And so kind of equalizing that a little bit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=8190)|
| 2:16:34| because there's nowhere for them to build the same things that we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=8194)|
| 2:16:39| And if they did, then that would take away from us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=8199)|
| 2:16:42| So it's sort of that give and take in different places.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=8202)|
| 2:16:46| I don't think the legislature will do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=8206)|
| 2:16:50| That's what I'm trying to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=8210)|
| 2:16:51| And Mr. Kelly, did you have a comment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=8211)|
| 2:16:55| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=8215)|
| 2:16:56| I'm so sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=8216)|
| 2:16:57| You probably had your mic down for an hour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=8217)|
| 2:17:00| It's totally random.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=8220)|
| 2:17:01| I don't know who this goes to, but it does involve the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=8221)|
| 2:17:04| And the reason that I ask is that I only have a little bit of time left| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=8224)|
| 2:17:06| here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=8226)|
| 2:17:07| And so if there was a golden buzzer moment for know where to speak,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=8227)|
| 2:17:09| this is something I'm passionate about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=8229)|
| 2:17:11| So I was looking at the specific cut for like the psychology,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=8231)|
| 2:17:15| mental health area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=8235)|
| 2:17:16| And that was really concerning because a couple of months ago when we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=8236)|
| 2:17:19| were sitting in a boardroom across the street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=8239)|
| 2:17:21| I heard you all promising this continual growth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=8241)|
| 2:17:26| And I know that times are warranting these drastic measures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=8246)|
| 2:17:30| But what kind of fueled me saying this was my experience over the last| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=8250)|
| 2:17:34| three years working on the student advisory council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=8254)|
| 2:17:36| hand in hand with Project U.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=8256)|
| 2:17:38| And can I just remind you when I was working with Mrs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=8258)|
| 2:17:40| Dew and Ms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=8260)|
| 2:17:41| Campbell, some of the stuff we did,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=8261)|
| 2:17:43| we did the anti-vaping campaign here in Knoxville that had over 50| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=8263)|
| 2:17:46| entries into the video contest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=8266)|
| 2:17:48| We did stuff preparing presentations for the DEO and that task force.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=8268)|
| 2:17:53| There's so much going on behind the scenes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=8273)|
| 2:17:55| And I know that in this time that we've been shut down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=8275)|
| 2:17:58| I could be totally wrong,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=8278)|
| 2:18:00| but I'm pretty sure that we haven't been offering counseling services or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=8280)|
| 2:18:03| any kind of other outlets for students to get the help that they need as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=8283)|
| 2:18:07| a traditional in-school building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=8287)|
| 2:18:09| So I know it's so uncertain whether or not we're going back and what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=8289)|
| 2:18:13| that's going to look like in the fall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=8293)|
| 2:18:14| But if we do go back and we have these reduced cuts or excuse me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=8294)|
| 2:18:18| if we don't go back, what's in place?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=8298)|
| 2:18:20| Are we still going to have this front of no counseling services are being| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=8300)|
| 2:18:23| offered or at least a limited amount?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=8303)|
| 2:18:25| Like what's available?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=8305)|
| 2:18:27| Because it's really concerning, especially as a senior in high school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=8307)|
| 2:18:30| who has like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=8310)|
| 2:18:32| I've gone through puberty and my brain is working a little bit different| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=8312)|
| 2:18:35| than an elementary schooler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=8315)|
| 2:18:36| And even I have severe anxiety from this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=8316)|
| 2:18:39| And that's not to say the other 60,000 kids in the district don't feel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=8319)|
| 2:18:43| the same way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=8323)|
| 2:18:44| And what like elementary schoolers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=8324)|
| 2:18:46| they're in a completely different environment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=8326)|
| 2:18:48| They're still developing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=8328)|
| 2:18:49| They're not having these crucial time periods where they're getting social| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=8329)|
| 2:18:52| skills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=8332)|
| 2:18:53| So it's really disheartening that something so theoretical is just like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=8333)|
| 2:18:57| being pushed through,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=8337)|
| 2:18:59| because I'm just really concerned for the butterfly effect that such a small| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=8339)|
| 2:19:03| decrease or the small lack of planning could create a huge effect for our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=8343)|
| 2:19:07| students in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=8347)|
| 2:19:09| That's a good question, Mr. Kelly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=8349)|
| 2:19:11| And I also had a question about school culture that I,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=8351)|
| 2:19:14| that I sent to Ron and Joe, because it's hard to tell with this budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=8354)|
| 2:19:18| So my question was, are we decreasing school culture?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=8358)|
| 2:19:21| So who would like to take on this question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=8361)|
| 2:19:24| Mr. McPherson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=8364)|
| 2:19:27| This, I think this, I don't think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=8367)|
| 2:19:29| I wouldn't characterize it necessarily as decreasing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=8369)|
| 2:19:32| unless somebody corrects me, unless I'm missing something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=8372)|
| 2:19:35| I would say those were some of the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=8375)|
| 2:19:39| there was a good part of the initiatives in March that we were working| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=8379)|
| 2:19:43| towards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=8383)|
| 2:19:44| These would have been part of those enhancements that we wanted to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=8384)|
| 2:19:48| implement, to enhance mental supports.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=8388)|
| 2:19:53| So there were a considerable amount of positions that we just are not able| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=8393)|
| 2:20:01| to find.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=8401)|
| 2:20:02| So I wouldn't call it a cut, but I think Mr. Kelly's,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=8402)|
| 2:20:06| it's pretty well spot on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=8406)|
| 2:20:10| Just even staying where you are is not where we want to be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=8410)|
| 2:20:13| because we wanted to, obviously we wanted, we need to put some effort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=8413)|
| 2:20:18| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=8418)|
| 2:20:21| We don't have the money to fix that mic, Ron.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=8421)|
| 2:20:27| That's a budget cut too, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=8427)|
| 2:20:29| Yeah, that was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=8429)|
| 2:20:32| So anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=8432)|
| 2:20:35| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=8435)|
| 2:20:36| I mean.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=8436)|
| 2:20:37| You put that in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=8437)|
| 2:20:38| This is probably going to make you two, probably.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=8438)|
| 2:20:44| Mr. Thomas, would you want to speak to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=8444)|
| 2:20:48| I just wanted to say too that part of the move to the TVA tower,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=8448)|
| 2:20:52| the county was going to pick up our space costs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=8452)|
| 2:20:55| but we were hoping to take that money to enhance our supports for mental,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=8455)|
| 2:21:01| emotional, social issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=8461)|
| 2:21:04| So, you know, again, with the budget that we're faced with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=8464)|
| 2:21:07| Also, I'm not sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=8467)|
| 2:21:08| I'm not looking at that page.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=8468)|
| 2:21:09| I don't know if there's a vacant position that's a part of that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=8469)|
| 2:21:13| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=8473)|
| 2:21:14| So there are a number of positions that we're not going to be able to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=8474)|
| 2:21:19| that was part of the increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=8479)|
| 2:21:21| There is also a vacant position, which was actually going to be an increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=8481)|
| 2:21:27| So what happened is we reallocated some contracted services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=8487)|
| 2:21:31| The board approved that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=8491)|
| 2:21:33| We were going to do some of those in-house,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=8493)|
| 2:21:35| so we reallocated some of those dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=8495)|
| 2:21:37| I think they were originally to UT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=8497)|
| 2:21:39| We reallocated that into additional personnel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=8499)|
| 2:21:43| because we were going to manage that in-house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=8503)|
| 2:21:45| I think we've added some of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=8505)|
| 2:21:46| There was one other position we wanted to add that is actually a cut| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=8506)|
| 2:21:50| because it was a vacant position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=8510)|
| 2:21:53| So, you know, that technically is a cut because it was in the budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=8513)|
| 2:21:59| but it was not a position that we had ever actually, that we had not filled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=8519)|
| 2:22:04| We were in the process of doing it, and then the COVID hit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=8524)|
| 2:22:07| So, you know, I will also say that when we, in the TVA, you know, the move,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=8527)|
| 2:22:16| our hope at that time was to take the dollars that were saved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=8536)|
| 2:22:20| in operating costs here at the AJ.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=8540)|
| 2:22:23| And we had made a commitment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=8543)|
| 2:22:25| And, you know, I remember at the time we were careful to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=8545)|
| 2:22:27| you know, we probably ought to say, you know, pending available resources,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=8547)|
| 2:22:31| you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=8551)|
| 2:22:34| You know, Bob said, you know, we always need to say that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=8554)|
| 2:22:36| You never know what's coming down the road, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=8556)|
| 2:22:38| And I thought, well, this is what we're going to do, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=8558)|
| 2:22:40| But anyway, we said, you know, pending available resources,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=8560)|
| 2:22:42| we're going to channel that money into these additional supports,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=8562)|
| 2:22:45| mental health supports.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=8565)|
| 2:22:47| And then who would have ever thought something like this would come along.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=8567)|
| 2:22:50| So, anyway, that's, I think Noah's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=8570)|
| 2:22:54| You know, this is somewhere, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=8574)|
| 2:22:56| these are things that were really high on our list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=8576)|
| 2:22:59| And we just were unable to get there this year because of what's happened,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=8579)|
| 2:23:03| kind of blindsided by all this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=8583)|
| 2:23:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=8587)|
| 2:23:08| Do we have other questions or comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=8588)|
| 2:23:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=8591)|
| 2:23:12| Probably do need to add $100 for a new microphone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=8592)|
| 2:23:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=8596)|
| 2:23:17| Thank you for a good discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=8597)|
| 2:23:18| I have a very tiny one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=8598)|
| 2:23:19| The folks that we are looking at from central office and system-wide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=8599)|
| 2:23:25| that may be RIFT, would they be eligible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=8605)|
| 2:23:30| or would they be first consideration for school-level positions if they came open?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=8610)|
| 2:23:38| Sorry, I was trying to multitask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=8618)|
| 2:23:40| The RIFT, the 20 positions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=8620)|
| 2:23:43| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=8623)|
| 2:23:44| Well, you know, obviously people would be certainly allowed to apply for whatever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=8624)|
| 2:23:51| you know, whatever came open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=8631)|
| 2:23:54| You know, one of the questions we had got earlier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=8634)|
| 2:23:56| I need to adjust this but I'm afraid to touch it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=8636)|
| 2:23:59| Whatever, you know, whatever becomes available,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=8639)|
| 2:24:02| obviously we would love for people not to lose their jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=8642)|
| 2:24:06| The dilemma that we're faced with is you kind of don't really know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=8646)|
| 2:24:12| if revenue is coming in better than expected| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=8652)|
| 2:24:14| until you're several months down the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=8654)|
| 2:24:17| And so, obviously, once people leave, they're not, if they're losing their job,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=8657)|
| 2:24:21| they're going to be looking for a job somewhere else, obviously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=8661)|
| 2:24:24| And so, but yes, I mean, we would consider, I think anyone that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=8664)|
| 2:24:29| that had been RIFT, that position, we would definitely, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=8669)|
| 2:24:33| if that person wanted to reapply at some other position| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=8673)|
| 2:24:36| or if a position came back, then most certainly we would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=8676)|
| 2:24:39| Yeah, and let me jump, Scott may jump in here too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=8679)|
| 2:24:42| but if they're a certified person with tenure, then, you know, vacancies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=8682)|
| 2:24:47| we would, they would have a position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=8687)|
| 2:24:50| Right, like so for instance, and I appreciate you saying that, Mr. Thomas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=8690)|
| 2:24:53| like for instance, there was a, you know, a couple of classrooms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=8693)|
| 2:24:56| that would be affected with pre-K, and I know Scott and his folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=8696)|
| 2:25:00| have worked hard to make sure that those instructional positions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=8700)|
| 2:25:04| there is, we found a place for those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=8704)|
| 2:25:06| So, obviously, that's our first objective is to place teachers, if that happens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=8706)|
| 2:25:16| Can I add something to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=8716)|
| 2:25:17| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=8717)|
| 2:25:18| Sorry, Board Chair, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=8718)|
| 2:25:20| I was just going to say that was the purpose of our hiring pause that we were under| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=8720)|
| 2:25:23| so that we could, as best as possible, have places for the displaced people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=8723)|
| 2:25:29| that were affected by any of those positions that were lost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=8729)|
| 2:25:32| And so I think we've been pretty successful in trying to do that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=8732)|
| 2:25:35| to the greatest extent possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=8735)|
| 2:25:37| Great, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=8737)|
| 2:25:38| Mr. Dupley, would you like to weigh in on the BEP conversation, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=8738)|
| 2:25:42| I sure can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=8742)|
| 2:25:44| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=8744)|
| 2:25:45| The lawsuit that Ms. Owen talked about was small school districts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=8745)|
| 2:25:51| across Tennessee versus McWhirter, who was the governor at the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=8751)|
| 2:25:55| And she accurately described what happened,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=8755)|
| 2:25:59| which was that the BEP is slanted to better support those small school districts now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=8759)|
| 2:26:07| the rural school districts versus UR pending.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=8767)|
| 2:26:11| There were three at one time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=8771)|
| 2:26:13| Hamilton County bowed out of their lawsuit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=8773)|
| 2:26:16| but Metro Nashville and Shelby County Schools are still pursuing their lawsuits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=8776)|
| 2:26:22| And I believe what they're looking at,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=8782)|
| 2:26:25| and what this board may want to consider advocating for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=8785)|
| 2:26:29| but probably not through a lawsuit, is raising the entire BEP| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=8789)|
| 2:26:35| and asking that these other positions be paid, such as social workers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=8795)|
| 2:26:41| such as nurses, and those areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=8801)|
| 2:26:45| Raise it for everybody so that everybody benefits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=8805)|
| 2:26:49| So I just wanted to add that in there so that you all have that information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=8809)|
| 2:26:53| Thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=8813)|
| 2:26:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=8815)|
| 2:26:56| Ms. Coatney, can we go for the question, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200527?start=8816)|
