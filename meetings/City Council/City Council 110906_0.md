| 0:03:01| Under the Mayor's report, I have a few things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110906?start=181)|
| 0:03:09| Let me first talk about the Booms Day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110906?start=189)|
| 0:03:11| We had a successful Booms Day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110906?start=191)|
| 0:03:13| The rain let up for a while, and a lot of city employees were involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110906?start=193)|
| 0:03:18| And we, as always, appreciate the good work along with that of the Tourism| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110906?start=198)|
| 0:03:23| and Sports Corporation for all their efforts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110906?start=203)|
| 0:03:27| Also, I want to congratulate our fleet department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110906?start=207)|
| 0:03:31| Deputy Director Keith Shields and his staff have earned the ASE Blue Seal Award.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110906?start=211)|
| 0:03:38| This is the third year in a row that Knoxville has received the award.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110906?start=218)|
| 0:03:43| Our fleet department does an outstanding job, and without this great service,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110906?start=223)|
| 0:03:48| key city departments could not do their jobs nearly as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110906?start=228)|
| 0:03:52| Congratulations, Keith, for this recognition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110906?start=232)|
| 0:03:56| And I also want to congratulate our Risk Management Department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110906?start=236)|
| 0:04:00| for another outstanding accomplishment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110906?start=240)|
| 0:04:03| Knoxville was this year's winner for the fifth annual National Underwriter Award for Excellence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110906?start=243)|
| 0:04:10| in Worker Compensation Risk Management Programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110906?start=250)|
| 0:04:14| Again, I want to thank Gary Eastis for the fine work of the department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110906?start=254)|
| 0:04:18| And I believe there is someone here from the fleet department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110906?start=258)|
| 0:04:25| If you want to come down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110906?start=265)|
| 0:04:32| Yes, if you would come down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110906?start=272)|
| 0:04:35| Why don't you all come down to the mic and give your name, if you would like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110906?start=275)|
| 0:04:50| Keith Shields, Deputy Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110906?start=290)|

| 0:04:57| Roger Rainey, Light Shop Supervisor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110906?start=297)|
| 0:05:00| All right, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110906?start=300)|
| 0:05:01| Now we can recognize you properly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110906?start=301)|
| 0:05:15| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110906?start=315)|
| 0:05:16| And also we talk about our carts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110906?start=316)|
| 0:05:20| Friday, September the 9th, the city of Knoxville will host a cart rollout event at 1030| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110906?start=320)|
| 0:05:29| Friday, September the 9th, in the 1,000 block of Luttrell Street in the 4th and Gill neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110906?start=329)|
| 0:05:38| to celebrate the city's new household recycling program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110906?start=338)|
| 0:05:42| David Brace and his team have worked very long and hard to bring this about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110906?start=342)|
| 0:05:47| I see Mr. Brace here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110906?start=347)|
| 0:05:49| Did you want to come down and say anything?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110906?start=349)|
| 0:05:51| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110906?start=351)|
| 0:05:54| Also, let me mention early voting, which begins tomorrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110906?start=354)|
| 0:05:59| And it continues until September the 22nd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110906?start=359)|
| 0:06:03| And you can vote at a variety of locations, Monday through Friday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110906?start=363)|
| 0:06:08| Times will be from 11 a.m. to 7 p.m. and Saturday from 11 to 5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110906?start=368)|
| 0:06:17| Are there any reports of council?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110906?start=377)|
| 0:06:21| Councilman Pavlis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110906?start=381)|
| 0:06:22| Yes, I'd just like to bring attention to the event being held this Sunday at the Knoxville Turkish Cultural Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110906?start=382)|
| 0:06:30| It's their second annual fundraising event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110906?start=390)|
| 0:06:36| We have Turkish food, baked goods, crafts, door prizes, unique gifts, Turkish handcrafts, entertainment, live music.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110906?start=396)|
| 0:06:46| It really sounds like it's going to be a great event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110906?start=406)|
| 0:06:48| And I particularly want to bring attention to it because the beneficiary of this is the Tennessee School for the Deaf,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110906?start=408)|
| 0:06:55| which obviously is in my district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110906?start=415)|
| 0:06:59| And they'd be the beneficiary of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110906?start=419)|
| 0:07:01| So from 1 to 6 this Sunday, 7035 Middlebrook Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110906?start=421)|
| 0:07:08| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110906?start=428)|
| 0:07:09| Thank you, Councilman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110906?start=429)|
| 0:07:10| Councilwoman Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110906?start=430)|
| 0:07:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110906?start=431)|
| 0:07:12| I'd just like to call attention to the fact that we actually have an early voting location in the 3rd District for the first time ever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110906?start=432)|
| 0:07:19| And so we're very excited about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110906?start=439)|
| 0:07:21| And it's also convenient for people in the 5th and the 4th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110906?start=441)|
| 0:07:24| And the location is on Clinton Highway in the retail center behind Blockbuster Video and in front of the Expo Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110906?start=444)|
| 0:07:32| And we're very excited in the 3rd District for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110906?start=452)|
| 0:07:35| And as the mayor pointed out, vote early.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110906?start=455)|
| 0:07:39| And if you lived in Chicago, you would say to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110906?start=459)|
| 0:07:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110906?start=462)|
| 0:07:44| Vice Mayor Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110906?start=464)|
| 0:07:45| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110906?start=465)|
| 0:07:47| The co-chairmen of the Pension Task Force are with us tonight, and I'd like to ask them to come to the podium, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110906?start=467)|
| 0:07:54| As you may remember, when we formed the Pension Task Force,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110906?start=474)|
| 0:07:58| we suggested that they come to us every 90 days or within 90 days and give us an update.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110906?start=478)|
| 0:08:05| And so they are with us here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110906?start=485)|
| 0:08:07| And I believe that co-chairman, Madam Chairman Dennis Moretz, is going to do the honor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110906?start=487)|
| 0:08:14| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110906?start=494)|
| 0:08:15| We've had two meetings so far, one July 12th and the other August 18th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110906?start=495)|
| 0:08:21| Summer schedules made it a little bit difficult for us to get started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110906?start=501)|
| 0:08:26| July was merely our organizational meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110906?start=506)|
| 0:08:28| and our August meeting we heard from Bud Gilbert, Legal Counsel for the Pension Board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110906?start=508)|
| 0:08:34| Alan Pennington, who is the actuary, and Mike Cherry, the Executive Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110906?start=514)|
| 0:08:39| Our next meeting is scheduled for September 15th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110906?start=519)|
| 0:08:43| and we have requested that the Pension Board Investment Advisor attend and present at that meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110906?start=523)|
| 0:08:51| We have not gotten yet a confirmation, but hope to hear back about that soon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110906?start=531)|
| 0:08:58| We think the fact-gathering will continue for the Pension Board probably through November,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110906?start=538)|
| 0:09:05| and then we'll get down to the business of evaluating the facts as they've been presented to us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110906?start=545)|
| 0:09:13| and proceeding with recommendations to City Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110906?start=553)|
| 0:09:20| Any questions from Council members while we've got them here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110906?start=560)|
| 0:09:23| I know our General Counsel, Charles Swanson, gave us an update a little earlier this evening,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110906?start=563)|
| 0:09:28| but we really appreciate all your hard work and look forward to the finale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110906?start=568)|
| 0:09:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110906?start=574)|
| 0:09:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110906?start=575)|
| 0:09:37| Councilman Woodall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110906?start=577)|
| 0:09:38| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110906?start=578)|
| 0:09:40| I've been on the Food Policy Council for about eight years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110906?start=580)|
| 0:09:43| and Food Policy Council was actually the first of its kind in the nation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110906?start=583)|
| 0:09:48| and it was asked to study the access to food and the quality of food within our city limits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110906?start=588)|
| 0:09:55| Tomorrow at noon, the Food Policy Council is going to have a candidate forum, not a debate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110906?start=595)|
| 0:10:01| There won't be any arguing going on, just a lot of good conversation about food policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110906?start=601)|
| 0:10:06| And this will take place September 7th, that's tomorrow, at noon at the Bill Lyons Pavilion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110906?start=606)|
| 0:10:13| Does anybody know where that is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110906?start=613)|
| 0:10:16| That's Market Square Mall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110906?start=616)|
| 0:10:17| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110906?start=617)|
| 0:10:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110906?start=618)|
| 0:10:19| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110906?start=619)|

| 0:14:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110906?start=868)|
| 0:14:29| I read the report from MPC and I've talked to a couple of the neighbors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110906?start=869)|
| 0:14:33| and I just wanted to find out for sure what are the plans for the additional property once it's given over to you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110906?start=873)|
| 0:14:43| Well, there's no plans for it except to close it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110906?start=883)|
| 0:14:46| We run a school right there where that alley comes through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110906?start=886)|
| 0:14:50| As a matter of fact, I just left there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110906?start=890)|
| 0:14:52| We have about 70-something apprentices that go in and out of the bottom of the building right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110906?start=892)|
| 0:14:58| And sometimes there's traffic flying through there just to cut off going up to the stop sign and going left or right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110906?start=898)|
| 0:15:04| There's no plans as far as anything to do with the alley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110906?start=904)|
| 0:15:08| Well, I mean, what about the property that adjoins the alley?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110906?start=908)|
| 0:15:11| Is it going to be future parking?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110906?start=911)|
| 0:15:12| Are you going to continue your access on to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110906?start=912)|
| 0:15:15| We can use it for parking if we can stop the traffic right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110906?start=915)|
| 0:15:21| We have a parking lot that's big.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110906?start=921)|
| 0:15:23| Right, I realize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110906?start=923)|

| 0:15:25| W-A-T-E-T-V.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110906?start=925)|
| 0:15:27| And when they come around from behind the building, we have kids parking there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110906?start=927)|
| 0:15:31| Right now the parking lot's full.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110906?start=931)|
| 0:15:33| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110906?start=933)|
| 0:15:34| But they come flying through there, and these kids come out, and they've got their mind on something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110906?start=934)|
| 0:15:38| And I'm just afraid one of these days we're going to have an accident there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110906?start=938)|
| 0:15:40| It could be avoided.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110906?start=940)|
| 0:15:41| Right, I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110906?start=941)|
| 0:15:42| But is there any plan for the property that adjoins the alley that's across the alley from your place?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110906?start=942)|
| 0:15:49| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110906?start=949)|
