| 0:01:28| Knoxville's short-term rental ordinance was passed before any of the members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=88)|
| 0:01:31| who are serving on Council right now were in office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=91)|
| 0:01:35| It's been four years since the ordinance went into effect in January of 2018,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=95)|
| 0:01:39| so Council is interested in hearing an update on this topic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=99)|
| 0:01:43| In advance of our workshop, I wanted to recognize a few folks who had reached out to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=103)|
| 0:01:47| Council has heard from Community Forum, West Hills Community Association,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=107)|
| 0:01:52| the Kingston Pikes Sequoia Hills Association's Advisory Board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=112)|
| 0:01:56| the Norwood Homeowners Group, and the Homeowners on Holloway Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=116)|
| 0:02:00| So we thank you for submitting some information for us from your perspective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=120)|
| 0:02:05| Also tonight, we want to welcome Deputy to the Mayor Gill,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=125)|
| 0:02:10| Christina Magrans from the Law Department, Stephanie O'Hara from MTAS,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=130)|
| 0:02:16| which is the Municipal Technical Advisory Service,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=136)|
| 0:02:19| for those of you who don't know what MTAS stands for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=139)|
| 0:02:22| Fiona McAnally, and Donna Dyer is here as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=142)|
| 0:02:25| So we thank you all for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=145)|
| 0:02:28| We look forward to hearing your presentation, so I'll turn it over to Deputy to the Mayor Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=148)|
| 0:02:33| Great. Thank you, Vice Mayor, and good to see everyone tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=153)|
| 0:02:36| I know this is a topic that we've had some conversations about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=156)|
| 0:02:39| but it is new to you in terms of your not being here when it was passed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=159)|
| 0:02:43| and it's also new largely to our team in that we took this over as an administration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=163)|
| 0:02:50| I was working at the city when this was passed, but not in my current role.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=170)|
| 0:02:54| I don't know that the mic is working.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=174)|
| 0:02:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=176)|
| 0:02:59| Do I need to unmute myself?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=179)|
| 0:03:01| Can you all hear us in the back? No?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=181)|
| 0:03:06| Can you hear me okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=186)|
| 0:03:08| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=188)|
| 0:03:09| Okay. Maybe try to speak more directly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=189)|
| 0:03:11| Testing, testing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=191)|
| 0:03:12| Is that better?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=192)|
| 0:03:13| I just need to get really close.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=193)|
| 0:03:14| There you go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=194)|
| 0:03:15| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=195)|
| 0:03:16| So in any case, this is something that we have had to learn as well as a new administration and as a new team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=196)|
| 0:03:20| So I want to appreciate Council for asking for this workshop,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=200)|
| 0:03:24| and what I would propose we do, if you'll indulge us, is that we move quickly through the slides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=204)|
| 0:03:30| You do have them printed in front of you, and you'll see that they are pretty technical and nuanced,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=210)|
| 0:03:35| and that is a reflection of the ordinance itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=215)|
| 0:03:38| So my recommendation is that we move through the slides and then ask as much questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=218)|
| 0:03:43| and discussion as you'd like at the end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=223)|
| 0:03:45| I'll also note that you'll know me, my normal style is more conversational.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=225)|
| 0:03:49| You will see me reading slides a bit more than I like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=229)|
| 0:03:52| and that, again, is a reflection of the nuance that this ordinance demands,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=232)|
| 0:03:56| and especially as it interacts with state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=236)|
| 0:03:59| So, again, with those caveats, I am looking forward to the discussion this evening,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=239)|
| 0:04:04| and I want to recognize in addition to Ms. McGrons, Ms. McAnally, Ms. Dyer, and Ms. O'Hara from MTAS,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=244)|
| 0:04:11| that also Cheryl Ball on my team, Deputy Policy Officer, was also very instrumental in putting this together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=251)|
| 0:04:16| So thank you to the team who helped assist with this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=256)|
| 0:04:18| and we are looking forward to hopefully answering most, if not all, of your questions tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=258)|
| 0:04:24| So without much further ado, a little quick history.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=264)|
| 0:04:29| Again, it's been quite a few years the ordinance took effect in 2018,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=269)|
| 0:04:33| and a year later state law went into effect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=273)|
| 0:04:36| and defined some aspects of what and how local governments are allowed to regulate short-term rentals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=276)|
| 0:04:41| You can find more information about that process and the steps involved on our ordinance on the city's website.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=281)|
| 0:04:49| And the operations of short-term rentals in the city has evolved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=289)|
| 0:04:53| from when the city and those state laws took effect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=293)|
| 0:04:56| So in the year or two following that, city staff established more solid operating procedures,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=296)|
| 0:05:01| and we've learned a lot as we've gotten underway with this ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=301)|
| 0:05:04| So our focus for today's workshop is going to be on how the STR rentals are handled in the city today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=304)|
| 0:05:11| We're not going to go back in time and talk about how we used to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=311)|
| 0:05:14| We're going to talk about what we're doing today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=314)|
| 0:05:19| So let's start with an overview of the rental ordinance itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=319)|
| 0:05:23| You'll hear us use a couple terms and definitions to kind of set us off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=323)|
| 0:05:29| So we define a short-term rental as properties or a portion of a property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=329)|
| 0:05:35| that is rented for less than 30 days at a time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=335)|
| 0:05:38| and that less than 30 days is important because otherwise it is no longer a short-term rental.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=338)|
| 0:05:43| So if you hear us use the term STR, that's talking about the unit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=343)|
| 0:05:47| and if you hear us use the term STR platform,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=347)|
| 0:05:50| that is one of these websites or promotional platforms such as Airbnb, VRBO, HomeAway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=350)|
| 0:05:56| These are your commercial entities that many of us are familiar with based on our own travel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=356)|
| 0:06:04| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=364)|
| 0:06:06| The city does require operators of short-term rentals to apply for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=366)|
| 0:06:10| and obtain a permit through the tax office, and you have a copy of the application in front of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=370)|
| 0:06:15| It is also on the city website, and we have two types of permits you'll see referenced,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=375)|
| 0:06:21| and those types of permits are based primarily on how the property itself is zoned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=381)|
| 0:06:28| So type one, operating permit, these are for properties in a residential district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=388)|
| 0:06:35| and properties zoned residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=395)|
| 0:06:38| So these are operating permits that are owner-occupied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=398)|
| 0:06:42| Only one permit per person, and that is a natural person, can be permitted to someone in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=402)|
| 0:06:48| The owner is not required to be present while the unit is rented,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=408)|
| 0:06:52| and owner-occupied means the property where the short-term rental unit must be located| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=412)|
| 0:06:57| or, excuse me, is located must be the owner's principal residence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=417)|
| 0:07:01| and that's the term that we use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=421)|
| 0:07:03| It's principal residence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=423)|
| 0:07:08| The second type of permit, these are for areas that are non-residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=428)|
| 0:07:14| but they allow residential use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=434)|
| 0:07:16| So if you think about our current zones, those could be, for example, the DK zone downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=436)|
| 0:07:21| It could be commercial zones that allow a residential use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=441)|
| 0:07:25| It could be the industrial mixed-use IMU zone, for example, that allows residential use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=445)|
| 0:07:29| So anything that is not a residential zone but that allows a residential use within that zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=449)|
| 0:07:37| Here, the owner is not required to have the property as their principal residence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=457)|
| 0:07:42| However, the property and the entity must be in good standing, which means they're current on taxes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=462)|
| 0:07:48| and they have to have the permission of the owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=468)|
| 0:07:53| I'll get to that later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=473)|
| 0:07:55| Again, additional qualifications on the Type 2 that can be issued to an owner or a lessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=475)|
| 0:08:02| So, again, if you are the renter of a property within one of these zones, you can get a permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=482)|
| 0:08:09| You don't have to be the actual property owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=489)|
| 0:08:11| It is available to a person or an entity, so not limited to natural persons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=491)|
| 0:08:17| And here, a person or an entity can hold two permits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=497)|
| 0:08:22| The application will require the name and contact info for both the operator and the owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=502)|
| 0:08:27| So not just one person, but it could be two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=507)|
| 0:08:30| And if the owner is not the operator, you do have to have the owner's written permission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=510)|
| 0:08:37| All right, so you hear, again, these terms of occupancy, residency, ownership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=517)|
| 0:08:42| Let's pause here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=522)|
| 0:08:44| Ownership is specifically established by the recorded property deed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=524)|
| 0:08:51| That's information that's found on KGIS, and that is required for both Type 1 and Type 2 permits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=531)|
| 0:08:57| Residency, which is only required for Type 1, is established.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=537)|
| 0:09:03| This is from our ordinance, is established by at least two of the following, listing the address of the STR.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=543)|
| 0:09:10| It could be a motor vehicle registration of the owner, a valid driver's license or Tennessee ID card,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=550)|
| 0:09:17| school registration, voter registration, or an owner's W-2 mailing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=557)|
| 0:09:24| So this is how residency is established in our code, and it is similar,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=564)|
| 0:09:29| and sometimes the same, in fact, as other Tennessee cities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=569)|
| 0:09:32| So this is a very common way of defining residency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=572)|
| 0:09:39| Just additional application highlights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=579)|
| 0:09:40| Again, you have this in front of you, but it does also require compliance with life safety considerations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=580)|
| 0:09:46| It requires a city and county business license, and it requires notification of neighbors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=586)|
| 0:09:52| and the application includes a map that the applicant must fill out to show which properties they have notified| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=592)|
| 0:10:01| based on where the unit is located.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=601)|
| 0:10:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=606)|
| 0:10:07| Now I'm going to turn it over to Ms. McGrawns to talk about the State of Tennessee Rental Act.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=607)|
| 0:10:13| Good evening, Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=613)|
| 0:10:14| Can everyone hear me okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=614)|
| 0:10:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=616)|
| 0:10:17| My name is Christina McGrawns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=617)|
| 0:10:18| As Ms. Gill stated, I work for the City of Knoxville Law Department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=618)|
| 0:10:21| and I want to give you a little bit of information on the Short-Term Rental Unit Act, if you'll go to the next slide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=621)|
| 0:10:27| I have printed in here for you the citations if you want to go and do any additional research,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=627)|
| 0:10:33| but as we have noted, this statute became effective in May of 2018.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=633)|
| 0:10:38| The first thing that's very important that I want to point out is that there is a preemption clause in the state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=638)|
| 0:10:45| Now this is a clause which basically states that if there is a conflict between the state law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=645)|
| 0:10:53| and the city ordinance or any kind of local requirements at the legislative level,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=653)|
| 0:10:59| the state law is going to be controlling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=659)|
| 0:11:02| So the main area that we have identified a conflict with is in our revocation section of our city ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=662)|
| 0:11:09| We will discuss that in great detail later on in this presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=669)|
| 0:11:15| And this I want to point out as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=675)|
| 0:11:17| This is true even though the state law was enacted after the city enacted our ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=677)|
| 0:11:22| so it is still preempted to that effect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=682)|
| 0:11:25| The state law does authorize us to issue permits at the local level,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=685)|
| 0:11:30| and of course we have a permitting procedure, as Ms. Gill has already started going through with you all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=690)|
| 0:11:36| and it also establishes revocation requirements that we must operate within.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=696)|
| 0:11:41| And again, with revocation being one of the areas that we have identified there being a conflict with state law,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=701)|
| 0:11:48| we do have to defer to the state on that aspect, and we will discuss this later in the presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=708)|
| 0:11:53| And next I'd like to turn it over to Stephanie O'Hara,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=713)|
| 0:11:57| the legal consultant in the East Tennessee region with MTAS to cover legacy protections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=717)|
| 0:12:05| Good evening. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=725)|
| 0:12:07| Again, my name is Stephanie O'Hara, and I'm an MTAS legal consultant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=727)|
| 0:12:11| MTAS, if you're not familiar with it, serves Tennessee cities across the state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=731)|
| 0:12:15| and was established in 1949.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=735)|
| 0:12:17| I just want to tell you a little bit about us, and we serve all cities across the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=737)|
| 0:12:22| One of the areas that Vice Mayor asked me to talk about was the legacy provision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=742)|
| 0:12:27| So part of the Short-Term Rental Unit Act establishes a legacy clause,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=747)|
| 0:12:33| also known as grandfathering, but we prefer the language legacy clause,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=753)|
| 0:12:38| that any new local regulations will not apply to a unit if it meets certain criteria.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=758)|
| 0:12:46| And that criteria is that the unit was being used as a short-term rental unit prior to the ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=766)|
| 0:12:53| and one of the next two following things is true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=773)|
| 0:12:57| If a permit or approval of application was previously required,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=777)|
| 0:13:03| then the permit was issued or the application was approved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=783)|
| 0:13:06| which is the case for some of Knoxville's,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=786)|
| 0:13:09| anything established after the effective date of Knoxville's ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=789)|
| 0:13:13| Or if the permit was not previously required,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=793)|
| 0:13:16| the provider remitted the sales and use taxes for six of the 12 months| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=796)|
| 0:13:21| immediately preceding Knoxville's ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=801)|
| 0:13:25| So you have two types of legacy permits that you may have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=805)|
| 0:13:32| And so they may continue to operate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=812)|
| 0:13:34| If you are covered under the legacy provisions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=814)|
| 0:13:37| those units may continue to operate until the property is sold, transferred,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=817)|
| 0:13:43| ceases being used as a short-term rental unit for 30 continuous months,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=823)|
| 0:13:48| or has been in violation of a generally applicable law for three or more separate times,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=828)|
| 0:13:54| and it cannot be specific to a short-term rental unit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=834)|
| 0:13:56| but it has to be in relation to a short-term rental unit as adopted by the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=836)|
| 0:14:03| So I'm going to have a little visual effect on the next slide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=843)|
| 0:14:07| I'm trying to put a visual of what this would do for your city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=847)|
| 0:14:14| So anything prior to the effective date of January of 2018 of your ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=854)|
| 0:14:21| any of those cities, the legacy status only applies if they were paying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=861)|
| 0:14:25| applicable taxes for six of the previous 12 months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=865)|
| 0:14:30| But there is a carve-out in the statute that you can still require a permit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=870)|
| 0:14:34| and revocation may apply if they have three violations of a generally applicable law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=874)|
| 0:14:41| We'll go over revocation later in the presentation about how that works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=881)|
| 0:14:46| Anything after that ordinance, the current ordinance would apply,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=886)|
| 0:14:51| and only if they received a permit would the ordinance apply to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=891)|
| 0:14:57| So whatever law was in effect at the time that they became an operating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=897)|
| 0:15:03| or they held themselves out as an operating unit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=903)|
| 0:15:05| that law stays for that unit as long as they operate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=905)|
| 0:15:09| So any unit established prior to January of 2018 when there was not an ordinance in place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=909)|
| 0:15:15| can only have two requirements, a permit and then the revocation clause.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=915)|
| 0:15:20| Anything established after the effective date of this ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=920)|
| 0:15:24| continues having the ordinance regulations as long as they continue operating as a unit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=924)|
| 0:15:31| If you amend this ordinance or adopt a new ordinance at that time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=931)|
| 0:15:36| those regulations will only apply going forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=936)|
| 0:15:40| So what does this mean for your staff?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=940)|
| 0:15:42| It means that they could be applying three different ordinances or regulations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=942)|
| 0:15:49| at any one time based on when the unit was being held out as a short-term rental unit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=949)|
| 0:16:08| All right, and I want to point out at the time that our STR ordinance was passed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=968)|
| 0:16:14| we did go through and check and see if we would have any properties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=974)|
| 0:16:19| that would fall under the legacy protections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=979)|
| 0:16:22| We did that to sort of anticipate enforcement questions that might arise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=982)|
| 0:16:27| so that we could handle them smoothly and efficiently on the front end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=987)|
| 0:16:32| We were not able to see any that had paid the appropriate taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=992)|
| 0:16:38| Therefore, at least within the city of Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=998)|
| 0:16:41| we do not have any legacy or, again, as typically referred to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=1001)|
| 0:16:45| grandfathered in short-term rental properties in our city limits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=1005)|
| 0:16:50| All are required to follow the local ordinance as it is written today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=1010)|
| 0:16:55| And, of course, we have the state law that will apply and supersede| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=1015)|
| 0:16:59| to the extent that there are any conflicts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=1019)|
| 0:17:02| All right, thank you, ladies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=1022)|
| 0:17:04| So now let's shift to talk about various processes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=1024)|
| 0:17:07| related to the short-term rental ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=1027)|
| 0:17:11| So, first, taxes. We do require taxes to be paid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=1031)|
| 0:17:15| We have an occupancy tax, and that is collected| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=1035)|
| 0:17:18| and paid by the promotional platforms as well as sales tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=1038)|
| 0:17:21| So those come to us through those third-party booking agencies, if you will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=1041)|
| 0:17:28| That tax, occupancy and sales, that is collected on all short-term platforms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=1048)|
| 0:17:33| regardless of permit status.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=1053)|
| 0:17:34| Those Airbnbs, they don't interact with our permit system to know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=1054)|
| 0:17:38| so they just send us the money regardless of the permit status.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=1058)|
| 0:17:43| Of course, if an individual is renting outside of one of those traditional platforms,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=1063)|
| 0:17:49| then that operator would be responsible under our law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=1069)|
| 0:17:52| for collecting and paying that occupancy and sales tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=1072)|
| 0:17:57| All right, for noncompliant properties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=1077)|
| 0:18:00| and you've maybe heard us talk about our contract with Host Compliance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=1080)|
| 0:18:04| This is the contract that we have with a private company for monitoring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=1084)|
| 0:18:08| If you've heard and talked about this, you might have also heard us use the term Granicus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=1088)|
| 0:18:13| They acquired Host Compliance, so they're connected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=1093)|
| 0:18:15| They're the same contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=1095)|
| 0:18:18| Host Compliance is the term that we will use in this PowerPoint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=1098)|
| 0:18:21| So Host Compliance executes software,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=1101)|
| 0:18:24| and they can pair our list of permit holders, which they get from us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=1104)|
| 0:18:29| so they know who has a permit in the city of Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=1109)|
| 0:18:31| and they can pair those permit addresses with the properties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=1111)|
| 0:18:35| that are being advertised on the various platforms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=1115)|
| 0:18:38| And their goal is to identify properties that are being advertised that are not on our list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=1118)|
| 0:18:45| So if you've used one of these agencies, Airbnb, for example,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=1125)|
| 0:18:49| you'll know that they do not always list the actual property address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=1129)|
| 0:18:55| That's for a number of reasons, but you'll see until you book,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=1135)|
| 0:18:58| oftentimes, and maybe sometimes after you book,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=1138)|
| 0:19:00| you don't know the actual address of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=1140)|
| 0:19:03| You know generally the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=1143)|
| 0:19:05| And so I want to acknowledge that this is not necessarily a perfect system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=1145)|
| 0:19:08| This is a system that is highly reliant on human help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=1148)|
| 0:19:13| It is not a fully automated process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=1153)|
| 0:19:16| and so it does require quite a bit of human analysis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=1156)|
| 0:19:21| both on the side of Host Compliance, they do the heavy lifting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=1161)|
| 0:19:24| but then we do some work on our side as well to assure accuracy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=1164)|
| 0:19:28| I'll talk a little bit more about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=1168)|
| 0:19:30| So Host Compliance sends us the list of export of properties that they've flagged| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=1170)|
| 0:19:39| that are flagged as being noncompliant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=1179)|
| 0:19:43| We send letters based, or excuse me, Host Compliance, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=1183)|
| 0:19:48| Yeah, Host Compliance, not us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=1188)|
| 0:19:50| mails each of those noncompliant property owners a notice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=1190)|
| 0:19:55| They cast intentionally a wide net.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=1195)|
| 0:19:57| Again, they're often not able to identify the specific address,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=1197)|
| 0:20:00| so they send it to a wider set of properties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=1200)|
| 0:20:03| oftentimes in the vicinity of those addresses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=1203)|
| 0:20:06| or excuse me, properties where not an address is listed for the first letter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=1206)|
| 0:20:09| So if your neighbor, for example,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=1209)|
| 0:20:11| is operating a noncompliant short-term rental, you may get a letter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=1211)|
| 0:20:16| So we're casting a wide net trying to hone in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=1216)|
| 0:20:19| to find the noncompliant property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=1219)|
| 0:20:21| So generally, either the operator or the neighbor who received the letter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=1221)|
| 0:20:26| will contact the city, and if it's your neighbor and not you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=1226)|
| 0:20:30| you say, hey, that's not me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=1230)|
| 0:20:32| You may not know whether it's your neighbor either,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=1232)|
| 0:20:35| but you say it's not me, and we move on from there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=1235)|
| 0:20:38| So typically, the address is narrowed to one or two properties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=1238)|
| 0:20:42| by the second letter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=1242)|
| 0:20:43| So again, you're kind of funneling the list down as it goes through,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=1243)|
| 0:20:47| and sometimes we can resolve that quickly before the second letter goes out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=1247)|
| 0:20:51| because the property that was notified calls us and says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=1251)|
| 0:20:54| oh, I just got this letter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=1254)|
| 0:20:56| I guess I need a permit, and they get a permit, and we move on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=1256)|
| 0:20:59| So again, this does require human analysis to assure accuracy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=1259)|
| 0:21:03| and what we are doing in our team at the tax office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=1263)|
| 0:21:05| is comparing the list that host compliance sends us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=1265)|
| 0:21:09| just to double-check that we're not sending a noncompliance letter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=1269)|
| 0:21:12| to someone that does have a permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=1272)|
| 0:21:16| All right, so I'm going to walk through a case study,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=1276)|
| 0:21:18| kind of a flow chart, if you will, of how this would work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=1278)|
| 0:21:21| So again, host compliance is going to identify those noncompliant properties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=1281)|
| 0:21:26| and they're going to send a mailed notice to potential property owners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=1286)|
| 0:21:32| of that property that they've identified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=1292)|
| 0:21:34| There's two paths here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=1294)|
| 0:21:36| First path, ideally, is that the owner becomes compliant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=1296)|
| 0:21:38| They call and say, great, let me get a permit, and they become compliant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=1298)|
| 0:21:42| Second, if they don't, then we would send a second notification| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=1302)|
| 0:21:46| to that property owner, and it would be a second notice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=1306)|
| 0:21:49| That happens about 30 days afterwards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=1309)|
| 0:21:51| so we're keeping the process moving through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=1311)|
| 0:21:53| Again, another decision point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=1313)|
| 0:21:54| They can become compliant, and if they don't,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=1314)|
| 0:21:56| then they would get a third letter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=1316)|
| 0:21:58| Again, this is all written via mailed notice to the owner of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=1318)|
| 0:22:04| If they remain in noncompliance after that third letter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=1324)|
| 0:22:08| then they would be issued a citation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=1328)|
| 0:22:12| So I want to talk about becoming compliant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=1332)|
| 0:22:16| So again, we've used kind of the best case example| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=1336)|
| 0:22:18| that someone gets a permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=1338)|
| 0:22:19| They call and say, oh, I didn't realize this was required.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=1339)|
| 0:22:21| Let me get a permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=1341)|
| 0:22:23| I want to be clear, though, that they could also stop advertising| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=1343)|
| 0:22:26| for less than 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=1346)|
| 0:22:27| They could turn themselves into a long-term rental on the Airbnb platform,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=1347)|
| 0:22:30| and Airbnb doesn't preclude someone from using their platform| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=1350)|
| 0:22:34| to advertise a longer-term rental.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=1354)|
| 0:22:37| They could stop advertising at all, kind of go underground, so to speak,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=1357)|
| 0:22:40| in which we no longer have a way to know that they're continuing to operate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=1360)|
| 0:22:44| and they could then move to a long-term rental.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=1364)|
| 0:22:47| It's kind of synonymous with that 30-day line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=1367)|
| 0:22:51| Just a couple stats that folks pulled for me here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=1371)|
| 0:22:55| Approximately 72% of the advertising STR units do have addresses listed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=1375)|
| 0:23:01| So again, we're doing that human analysis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=1381)|
| 0:23:04| but 72% roughly are the number that we can more precisely identify.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=1384)|
| 0:23:09| And I think you know this too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=1389)|
| 0:23:10| If we were to issue a citation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=1390)|
| 0:23:12| that would be a citation of $50 per day per municipal code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=1392)|
| 0:23:19| All right, so our contract with Host Compliance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=1399)|
| 0:23:24| allows us use of a reporting hotline that is available 24-7,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=1404)|
| 0:23:29| and this is designed specifically to allow for in-the-moment reporting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=1409)|
| 0:23:33| So if you are having an issue with a short-term rental,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=1413)|
| 0:23:37| the hope is that you call this number in the moment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=1417)|
| 0:23:40| and you can get access to report that issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=1420)|
| 0:23:43| You don't have to wait until Monday morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=1423)|
| 0:23:45| That number is listed on the website.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=1425)|
| 0:23:47| It's a local number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=1427)|
| 0:23:48| It's not a 1-800 number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=1428)|
| 0:23:49| It's specific to us, and Host Compliance has real people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=1429)|
| 0:23:53| who will help work through a series of questions with the caller| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=1433)|
| 0:23:57| to establish the situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=1437)|
| 0:24:01| What happens next is Host Compliance provides a report| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=1441)|
| 0:24:04| to the city's tax office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=1444)|
| 0:24:06| and at that point the city follows up with the operator| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=1446)|
| 0:24:09| about the situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=1449)|
| 0:24:10| We send an email, but then we also follow up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=1450)|
| 0:24:12| with a written mailed notification of that complaint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=1452)|
| 0:24:15| And depending on the nature of the complaint,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=1455)|
| 0:24:17| various departments could be involved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=1457)|
| 0:24:19| depending on what's at issue here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=1459)|
| 0:24:21| The operator has 30 days to respond,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=1461)|
| 0:24:24| present evidence, and demonstrate compliance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=1464)|
| 0:24:31| Once they respond and present their evidence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=1471)|
| 0:24:34| our team, the city, will research the issues involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=1474)|
| 0:24:37| So examples of this would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=1477)|
| 0:24:39| if the content of the Airbnb ad complies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=1479)|
| 0:24:42| they have to list their permit, for example, permit number,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=1482)|
| 0:24:44| whether the operator making sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=1484)|
| 0:24:46| that they can currently establish residency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=1486)|
| 0:24:49| And city representatives determine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=1489)|
| 0:24:51| whether a violation has occurred| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=1491)|
| 0:24:52| and whether a citation should be issued,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=1492)|
| 0:24:54| and we'll talk more about those terms of violation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=1494)|
| 0:24:56| and citation later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=1496)|
| 0:24:57| Again, representatives, depending on the nature of the issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=1497)|
| 0:25:00| for these we are working| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=1500)|
| 0:25:02| very specifically with the tax office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=1502)|
| 0:25:04| the law department, policy and zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=1504)|
| 0:25:06| and we would bring in other departments as needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=1506)|
| 0:25:11| All right, so another case study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=1511)|
| 0:25:12| These are, you know, based on things that we've seen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=1512)|
| 0:25:16| So we would receive a report,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=1516)|
| 0:25:18| maybe someone called host compliance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=1518)|
| 0:25:19| and we received a report from the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=1519)|
| 0:25:21| that indicated that the short-term rental occupants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=1521)|
| 0:25:25| had not maintained trash| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=1525)|
| 0:25:26| in the appropriate containers for collection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=1526)|
| 0:25:29| City law would follow up with the operator.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=1529)|
| 0:25:31| They would mail them a written notice after an email| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=1531)|
| 0:25:35| and say, hey, this issue was flagged.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=1535)|
| 0:25:37| You need to respond to this complaint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=1537)|
| 0:25:39| In this case study, within 30 days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=1539)|
| 0:25:41| so within the timeline,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=1541)|
| 0:25:42| the operator acknowledged the receipt| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=1542)|
| 0:25:44| and they showed evidence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=1544)|
| 0:25:45| that they can have stronger communication| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=1545)|
| 0:25:48| with their tenants or their occupants,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=1548)|
| 0:25:51| and they acknowledged,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=1551)|
| 0:25:52| they required acknowledgement by their guests| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=1552)|
| 0:25:55| of the trash requirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=1555)|
| 0:25:56| So again, we've been those guests| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=1556)|
| 0:25:57| if you've booked on these platforms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=1557)|
| 0:25:58| where you have to say, I will take the trash out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=1558)|
| 0:26:00| I will not leave it in the bathroom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=1560)|
| 0:26:01| So again, they're strengthening the language here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=1561)|
| 0:26:03| to show their intention| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=1563)|
| 0:26:05| of really trying to address that issue that had been flagged.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=1565)|
| 0:26:10| All right, revoking permits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=1570)|
| 0:26:12| I'm going to turn this back over to Ms. O'Hara from MTAS| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=1572)|
| 0:26:16| to walk us through this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=1576)|
| 0:26:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=1581)|
| 0:26:22| So revoking permits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=1582)|
| 0:26:24| and it's used in the statute as saying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=1584)|
| 0:26:27| prohibiting the continued use of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=1587)|
| 0:26:30| So it doesn't actually say revoking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=1590)|
| 0:26:31| if you're looking for that language in the statute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=1591)|
| 0:26:34| But the Short-Term Rental Unit Act| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=1594)|
| 0:26:35| allows cities to adopt an ordinance to revoke permits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=1595)|
| 0:26:39| only if, as a direct result of the operation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=1599)|
| 0:26:43| of the short-term rental unit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=1603)|
| 0:26:44| there have been three or more separate violations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=1604)|
| 0:26:47| of generally applicable local laws.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=1607)|
| 0:26:50| And it has to be in direct relation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=1610)|
| 0:26:53| to them operating as a short-term rental unit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=1613)|
| 0:26:56| Some examples might be a noise ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=1616)|
| 0:27:00| Say there's a call,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=1620)|
| 0:27:02| there's loud noises coming from a short-term rental unit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=1622)|
| 0:27:06| and the officers respond,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=1626)|
| 0:27:09| and they're in violation of the noise ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=1629)|
| 0:27:12| that can be proved that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=1632)|
| 0:27:13| That would be a generally applicable law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=1633)|
| 0:27:16| because the noise ordinance applies to all people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=1636)|
| 0:27:19| within Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=1639)|
| 0:27:21| And if it's a unit that frequently has parties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=1641)|
| 0:27:25| and loud parties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=1645)|
| 0:27:26| that might be a violation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=1646)|
| 0:27:29| that is directly related to the use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=1649)|
| 0:27:31| as a short-term rental unit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=1651)|
| 0:27:33| It also could be parking if they're violating,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=1653)|
| 0:27:36| if they're parking in front of a driveway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=1656)|
| 0:27:37| or having lots of cars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=1657)|
| 0:27:40| Perhaps that might be one of the examples.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=1660)|
| 0:27:43| And the operator, after those violations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=1663)|
| 0:27:45| they have no more appeal rights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=1665)|
| 0:27:46| At that point, you could proceed to revoke their permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=1666)|
| 0:27:51| The burden, however, is on the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=1671)|
| 0:27:53| to prove these violations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=1673)|
| 0:27:55| so a complaint itself would be more difficult| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=1675)|
| 0:27:58| for the city to prove that this is a violation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=1678)|
| 0:28:00| It would need to be a citation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=1680)|
| 0:28:02| or some other type of proof that the city has itself| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=1682)|
| 0:28:05| that these violations have occurred.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=1685)|
| 0:28:11| All right, thank you, Stephanie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=1691)|
| 0:28:12| So, again, you're hearing a couple different terms here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=1692)|
| 0:28:15| so I want to pause and walk through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=1695)|
| 0:28:16| some of these definitions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=1696)|
| 0:28:17| for the sake of having a shared language.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=1697)|
| 0:28:20| So the term citation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=1700)|
| 0:28:22| that is the term that you'll see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=1702)|
| 0:28:23| in our local Knoxville ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=1703)|
| 0:28:26| and this can be issued| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=1706)|
| 0:28:27| when a local ordinance has not been followed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=1707)|
| 0:28:29| and has a possibility of fees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=1709)|
| 0:28:31| So, again, these are terms you're familiar with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=1711)|
| 0:28:32| We issue citations for many things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=1712)|
| 0:28:34| We could issue it specific to the short-term rental.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=1714)|
| 0:28:38| We could issue it for other things as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=1718)|
| 0:28:40| but that is a local term| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=1720)|
| 0:28:42| and relates to our local ability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=1722)|
| 0:28:43| to charge the possibility of fees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=1723)|
| 0:28:47| The term violation is a state of Tennessee term,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=1727)|
| 0:28:51| and that can be issued, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=1731)|
| 0:28:53| if the city can prove that the local ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=1733)|
| 0:28:57| that was not followed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=1737)|
| 0:28:59| was specifically a direct result| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=1739)|
| 0:29:02| of the operation of the short-term rental.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=1742)|
| 0:29:07| Revocation, that is a term you'll see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=1747)|
| 0:29:10| both from the state of Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=1750)|
| 0:29:11| and the local Knoxville term,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=1751)|
| 0:29:14| and that can be issued if the operator,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=1754)|
| 0:29:17| as Ms. Herrera just described,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=1757)|
| 0:29:19| can be issued only when| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=1759)|
| 0:29:20| the operator has received three violations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=1760)|
| 0:29:23| as defined above,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=1763)|
| 0:29:24| for the same short-term rental unit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=1764)|
| 0:29:27| And then you'll also see an appeal reference| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=1767)|
| 0:29:30| in both of the state of Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=1770)|
| 0:29:32| and the local Knoxville code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=1772)|
| 0:29:33| If a revocation is issued,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=1773)|
| 0:29:35| the operator can appeal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=1775)|
| 0:29:37| and the process is outlined in our code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=1777)|
| 0:29:40| And, again, the burden of proof| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=1780)|
| 0:29:41| to prove the violations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=1781)|
| 0:29:42| is on the city in that appeal process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=1782)|
| 0:29:49| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=1789)|
| 0:29:50| Now we will talk a bit more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=1790)|
| 0:29:52| about the process for situations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=1792)|
| 0:29:54| that may require additional action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=1794)|
| 0:29:56| So, should a situation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=1796)|
| 0:29:58| warrant further consideration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=1798)|
| 0:30:00| for a citation, a violation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=1800)|
| 0:30:02| or a revocation, any of the three,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=1802)|
| 0:30:04| then the city law department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=1804)|
| 0:30:05| would convene a group| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=1805)|
| 0:30:06| to review the situation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=1806)|
| 0:30:07| and determine next steps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=1807)|
| 0:30:09| So, again, depending on what the issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=1809)|
| 0:30:11| the potential citations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=1811)|
| 0:30:12| or violations are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=1812)|
| 0:30:13| this group could include| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=1813)|
| 0:30:15| a variety of folks from tax,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=1815)|
| 0:30:16| policy, zoning, codes, engineering,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=1816)|
| 0:30:19| KPD, fire, solid waste.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=1819)|
| 0:30:20| We would pull in the appropriate people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=1820)|
| 0:30:23| to determine whether| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=1823)|
| 0:30:25| a situation requires additional action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=1825)|
| 0:30:30| So, very quickly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=1830)|
| 0:30:33| we'll walk through another case study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=1833)|
| 0:30:35| So, this is a report| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=1835)|
| 0:30:37| received by the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=1837)|
| 0:30:38| that indicates the property is operating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=1838)|
| 0:30:40| as a short-term rental| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=1840)|
| 0:30:41| with a Type 1 permit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=1841)|
| 0:30:42| but the person who is reporting it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=1842)|
| 0:30:45| says that this is not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=1845)|
| 0:30:47| the principal residence of the owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=1847)|
| 0:30:49| So, they're saying this person| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=1849)|
| 0:30:50| doesn't live in this unit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=1850)|
| 0:30:51| but they're renting it anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=1851)|
| 0:30:53| The city, again, per code,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=1853)|
| 0:30:54| we follow up with that operator| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=1854)|
| 0:30:55| about the situation via email,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=1855)|
| 0:30:57| and we follow that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=1857)|
| 0:30:58| with a written mail notification| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=1858)|
| 0:31:00| of the complaint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=1860)|
| 0:31:04| Within 30 days, they respond,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=1864)|
| 0:31:06| and they provide the evidence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=1866)|
| 0:31:08| of residency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=1868)|
| 0:31:09| And, again, per our code,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=1869)|
| 0:31:10| residency is defined| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=1870)|
| 0:31:12| by providing two of the following| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=1872)|
| 0:31:14| that show the STR address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=1874)|
| 0:31:16| So, I want to be clear here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=1876)|
| 0:31:18| that, yes, they showed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=1878)|
| 0:31:21| their driver's license before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=1881)|
| 0:31:23| They could show their driver's license again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=1883)|
| 0:31:25| So, they may provide the same items| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=1885)|
| 0:31:27| with that submitted application,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=1887)|
| 0:31:29| but I will note that often| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=1889)|
| 0:31:31| those operators,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=1891)|
| 0:31:32| when we have pursued this conversation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=1892)|
| 0:31:34| they are often willing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=1894)|
| 0:31:35| to provide additional documentation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=1895)|
| 0:31:37| above and beyond just what the state,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=1897)|
| 0:31:39| or that the law would consider| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=1899)|
| 0:31:41| for compliance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=1901)|
| 0:31:42| So, as such, the city would consider| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=1902)|
| 0:31:45| this complaint resolved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=1905)|
| 0:31:49| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=1909)|
| 0:31:50| So, as we'll wrap up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=1910)|
| 0:31:51| and get into closer to questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=1911)|
| 0:31:52| I want to leave you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=1912)|
| 0:31:53| with a couple of just basic stats| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=1913)|
| 0:31:56| and details.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=1916)|
| 0:31:57| So, as of right at the end of last month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=1917)|
| 0:32:00| we had a total of 447 operating permits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=1920)|
| 0:32:04| 293 were Type I's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=1924)|
| 0:32:06| and 154 were Type II's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=1926)|
| 0:32:08| And a list of each of these permits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=1928)|
| 0:32:10| is publicly available on our website.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=1930)|
| 0:32:15| This is a breakdown of the occupancy tax| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=1935)|
| 0:32:18| that we have received to date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=1938)|
| 0:32:20| So, again, note that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=1940)|
| 0:32:21| that is from the beginning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=1941)|
| 0:32:22| of the ordinance effectiveness at 2018| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=1942)|
| 0:32:26| and all the way through,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=1946)|
| 0:32:27| again, as of today in 2022,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=1947)|
| 0:32:30| just under $900,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=1950)|
| 0:32:33| In terms of hotline calls and violations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=1953)|
| 0:32:38| so we have received,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=1958)|
| 0:32:39| you can see there at the top,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=1959)|
| 0:32:41| to date in 2022,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=1961)|
| 0:32:42| we've received two hotline calls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=1962)|
| 0:32:45| In 2021, we received 16,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=1965)|
| 0:32:48| and in 2020, we received 18.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=1968)|
| 0:32:50| I note this next section, however,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=1970)|
| 0:32:52| because in 2021,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=1972)|
| 0:32:55| we provided you a sampling here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=1975)|
| 0:32:56| 10 of the 16 calls were received| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=1976)|
| 0:33:00| and we received a report on them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=1980)|
| 0:33:01| but they were for items and situations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=1981)|
| 0:33:04| that had nothing to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=1984)|
| 0:33:05| with a short-term rental.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=1985)|
| 0:33:06| So, again, the hotline| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=1986)|
| 0:33:08| is going to give us a report| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=1988)|
| 0:33:10| and log that call,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=1990)|
| 0:33:12| regardless of whether this person| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=1992)|
| 0:33:14| has kind of found the hotline by accident.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=1994)|
| 0:33:17| And you can see they wanted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=1997)|
| 0:33:18| to rent a pavilion at Victor Ashe Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=1998)|
| 0:33:20| Well, that's not really related| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2000)|
| 0:33:21| to the short-term rental,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2001)|
| 0:33:22| but we still flag it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2002)|
| 0:33:23| and still note it as a call| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2003)|
| 0:33:25| through host compliance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2005)|
| 0:33:27| So, again, in terms of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2007)|
| 0:33:29| the number of violations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2009)|
| 0:33:30| that have been issued to date,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2010)|
| 0:33:32| all the complaints have been resolved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2012)|
| 0:33:34| to comply to code and closed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2014)|
| 0:33:36| and that's a result of the outreach| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2016)|
| 0:33:38| to the operators| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2018)|
| 0:33:39| and working directly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2019)|
| 0:33:40| with the folks involved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2020)|
| 0:33:41| to get those issues resolved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2021)|
| 0:33:46| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2026)|
| 0:33:47| Very quickly, just a breakdown| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2027)|
| 0:33:48| of the size of these units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2028)|
| 0:33:49| You can see they range| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2029)|
| 0:33:51| from one-bedroom to five-bedroom,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2031)|
| 0:33:53| different varying levels of bathroom,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2033)|
| 0:33:55| the room type.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2035)|
| 0:33:56| Some of them are the entire home,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2036)|
| 0:33:57| but a few are just a portion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2037)|
| 0:33:59| of a home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2039)|
| 0:34:01| Again, single-family, multifamily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2041)|
| 0:34:03| Those don't break down neatly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2043)|
| 0:34:05| between type 1 and type 2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2045)|
| 0:34:06| You can imagine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2046)|
| 0:34:07| how you might have varying degrees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2047)|
| 0:34:09| Again, type 1 and type 2| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2049)|
| 0:34:10| is determined on zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2050)|
| 0:34:13| not single-family versus multifamily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2053)|
| 0:34:16| And then just very quickly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2056)|
| 0:34:18| a comparison with other Tennessee cities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2058)|
| 0:34:22| You can kind of see how we compare.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2062)|
| 0:34:24| Again, a lot of these cities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2064)|
| 0:34:25| because of the state law,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2065)|
| 0:34:27| they're not quite apples-to-apples.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2067)|
| 0:34:29| I'll be very clear,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2069)|
| 0:34:30| they're not apples-to-apples,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2070)|
| 0:34:31| but they share some similarities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2071)|
| 0:34:32| in terms of the general structure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2072)|
| 0:34:34| of how they delineate between permits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2074)|
| 0:34:37| Knoxville and Chattanooga,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2077)|
| 0:34:39| fairly neck-and-neck| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2079)|
| 0:34:40| when it comes to numbers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2080)|
| 0:34:41| and Nashville is a runaway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2081)|
| 0:34:43| with 6,500 permits as of today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2083)|
| 0:34:47| I will also note| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2087)|
| 0:34:48| that all the other peer cities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2088)|
| 0:34:50| are also using host compliance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2090)|
| 0:34:52| Again, host compliance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2092)|
| 0:34:53| is seen as kind of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2093)|
| 0:34:54| one of the industry standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2094)|
| 0:34:55| in the market,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2095)|
| 0:34:56| and we have felt| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2096)|
| 0:34:58| they've been a good partner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2098)|
| 0:35:00| All right, and then just before we close| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2100)|
| 0:35:03| and turn it over for questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2103)|
| 0:35:04| I will let Ms. McAnally| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2104)|
| 0:35:06| talk about the state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2106)|
| 0:35:07| of Tennessee legislative landscape.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2107)|
| 0:35:09| Thanks, Fiona.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2109)|
| 0:35:10| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2110)|
| 0:35:11| Fiona McAnally,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2111)|
| 0:35:12| Director of Legislative Affairs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2112)|
| 0:35:13| for the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2113)|
| 0:35:15| Regarding the legislative landscape| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2115)|
| 0:35:17| at the state,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2117)|
| 0:35:18| we won't know about any new bills| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2118)|
| 0:35:20| introduced for the next legislative session| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2120)|
| 0:35:23| until January or February.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2123)|
| 0:35:25| However, based on past years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2125)|
| 0:35:27| it's likely the short-term rental industry| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2127)|
| 0:35:29| will continue to introduce bills| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2129)|
| 0:35:31| that seek to limit local authority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2131)|
| 0:35:35| This past session,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2135)|
| 0:35:36| two bills were in play.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2136)|
| 0:35:38| Both provided for several measures| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2138)|
| 0:35:40| that would change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2140)|
| 0:35:41| how short-term rentals operated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2141)|
| 0:35:43| For example,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2143)|
| 0:35:44| one change would have increased| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2144)|
| 0:35:46| how ownership could be transferred| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2146)|
| 0:35:48| without forfeiting the ability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2148)|
| 0:35:50| to operate a short-term rental| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2150)|
| 0:35:51| under local ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2151)|
| 0:35:53| Currently, state law allows the owner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2153)|
| 0:35:55| to transfer the ability to operate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2155)|
| 0:35:57| to either a spouse or direct heir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2157)|
| 0:36:00| The legislation would have allowed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2160)|
| 0:36:02| for an unlimited number of transfers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2162)|
| 0:36:04| to anyone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2164)|
| 0:36:05| including a trust, LLC, or corporation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2165)|
| 0:36:09| Another feature in the bills| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2169)|
| 0:36:10| would have made enforcement more difficult| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2170)|
| 0:36:13| for local authorities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2173)|
| 0:36:15| Current law allows the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2175)|
| 0:36:17| to prevent a short-term rental| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2177)|
| 0:36:19| from continuing to operate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2179)|
| 0:36:20| after three violations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2180)|
| 0:36:22| of any city ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2182)|
| 0:36:24| The proposed bill| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2184)|
| 0:36:25| would have limited the three violations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2185)|
| 0:36:27| to a 12-month period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2187)|
| 0:36:29| While on the surface,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2189)|
| 0:36:30| this might sound better,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2190)|
| 0:36:32| the change would have limited our ability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2192)|
| 0:36:35| or the city's ability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2195)|
| 0:36:36| to shut down a bad actor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2196)|
| 0:36:38| if one of those three violations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2198)|
| 0:36:40| happened after the 12-month period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2200)|
| 0:36:42| An example of this might be football season.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2202)|
| 0:36:45| So somebody had a violation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2205)|
| 0:36:47| in August and September| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2207)|
| 0:36:49| and the next year in October.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2209)|
| 0:36:51| Since that third violation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2211)|
| 0:36:52| fell outside the 12-month period,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2212)|
| 0:36:55| only two violations were within the 12-month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2215)|
| 0:36:57| which would have made it more difficult| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2217)|
| 0:36:59| to shut down the operator.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2219)|
| 0:37:02| However, both of these bills were defeated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2222)|
| 0:37:06| The city of Knoxville works with other cities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2226)|
| 0:37:08| the Tennessee Municipal League,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2228)|
| 0:37:10| as well as our delegation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2230)|
| 0:37:11| to minimize the impact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2231)|
| 0:37:12| of short-term rental legislation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2232)|
| 0:37:15| A lot of time and energy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2235)|
| 0:37:16| is spent making sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2236)|
| 0:37:17| the proposed changes in legislation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2237)|
| 0:37:19| are adequately explained| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2239)|
| 0:37:21| and understood by members of the legislature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2241)|
| 0:37:25| Sometimes these proposed changes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2245)|
| 0:37:27| are minimized by the opposition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2247)|
| 0:37:29| as you can imagine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2249)|
| 0:37:30| We will continue to be vigilant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2250)|
| 0:37:32| and monitor any legislation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2252)|
| 0:37:34| that changes our ability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2254)|
| 0:37:35| at the local level| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2255)|
| 0:37:36| to manage short-term rentals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2256)|
| 0:37:40| All right, thank you, Fiona.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2260)|
| 0:37:41| And on that sunny note,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2261)|
| 0:37:44| let's turn it over to questions and discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2264)|
| 0:37:48| Thank you all very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2268)|
| 0:37:49| We'll open it up for council questions now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2269)|
| 0:37:55| Council Member Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2275)|
| 0:37:57| Thank you, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2277)|
| 0:37:58| Thank you for that good explanation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2278)|
| 0:37:59| and all the details.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2279)|
| 0:38:00| This is very technical, as you suggested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2280)|
| 0:38:03| I have a very specific question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2283)|
| 0:38:04| related to renters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2284)|
| 0:38:06| It's my understanding that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2286)|
| 0:38:10| using Option 1, or excuse me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2290)|
| 0:38:15| Type 1 renters in a residential area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2295)|
| 0:38:20| with the approval of the property owner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2300)|
| 0:38:23| are allowed to apply.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2303)|
| 0:38:28| Is that the case?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2308)|
| 0:38:30| So our interpretation of our code| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2310)|
| 0:38:33| is that Type 1 is limited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2313)|
| 0:38:37| The permit could only be issued| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2317)|
| 0:38:39| to the actual owner-occupant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2319)|
| 0:38:42| I think that one might read our code| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2322)|
| 0:38:45| and suggest that a tenant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2325)|
| 0:38:47| because we use the term elsewhere| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2327)|
| 0:38:49| around an operator, owner, or lessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2329)|
| 0:38:53| would be eligible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2333)|
| 0:38:54| But our policy interpretation on our code| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2334)|
| 0:38:57| is that based on the conversations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2337)|
| 0:38:59| that happened when this was created,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2339)|
| 0:39:01| that there was a very clear intent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2341)|
| 0:39:03| to limit Type 1 permits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2343)|
| 0:39:05| only to the owner-occupant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2345)|
| 0:39:07| And we are using that interpretation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2347)|
| 0:39:10| to implement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2350)|
| 0:39:12| And can you help me understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2352)|
| 0:39:13| why renters would be treated differently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2353)|
| 0:39:15| in that regard?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2355)|
| 0:39:17| I think the discussion that was had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2357)|
| 0:39:19| when this ordinance was being created,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2359)|
| 0:39:21| there were concerns,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2361)|
| 0:39:22| and I think if you received some of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2362)|
| 0:39:25| the discussion from neighborhoods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2365)|
| 0:39:27| who had provided it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2367)|
| 0:39:28| even just for this workshop,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2368)|
| 0:39:29| I think that there were concerns raised| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2369)|
| 0:39:31| and articulated to the council at the time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2371)|
| 0:39:35| that they felt allowing renters| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2375)|
| 0:39:38| to essentially sublet on a short-term basis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2378)|
| 0:39:41| would provide further risks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2381)|
| 0:39:44| to some of the, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2384)|
| 0:39:47| I don't know what the terms they used,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2387)|
| 0:39:48| but we've heard terms around, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2388)|
| 0:39:50| protecting the character of a neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2390)|
| 0:39:52| you know, this idea of we want to have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2392)|
| 0:39:53| a single family,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2393)|
| 0:39:54| we're a residential neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2394)|
| 0:39:56| we don't want to turn it into| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2396)|
| 0:39:57| a commercial situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2397)|
| 0:39:59| And so, again, that owner-occupancy requirement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2399)|
| 0:40:01| was one of the key considerations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2401)|
| 0:40:03| in defining what a Type 1 permit was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2403)|
| 0:40:05| and that is the interpretation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2405)|
| 0:40:06| that we continue to make today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2406)|
| 0:40:08| Okay, I appreciate the interpretation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2408)|
| 0:40:09| It's not clear to me why a renter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2409)|
| 0:40:11| in that regard, would provide more liability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2411)|
| 0:40:14| or risk to the neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2414)|
| 0:40:16| than a property owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2416)|
| 0:40:17| So I'm not asking for you to comment on that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2417)|
| 0:40:20| but if some of my colleagues may be familiar with this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2420)|
| 0:40:23| or maybe during public comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2423)|
| 0:40:24| And part of it in our research,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2424)|
| 0:40:26| you know, again, we have the history| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2426)|
| 0:40:27| of the short-term rental ordinance process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2427)|
| 0:40:30| on our website,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2430)|
| 0:40:31| and again, part of us affirming| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2431)|
| 0:40:32| that, yes, this is the interpretation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2432)|
| 0:40:34| we would continue to make today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2434)|
| 0:40:35| is based on some of those historical records| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2435)|
| 0:40:37| that we can still consult.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2437)|
| 0:40:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2440)|
| 0:40:41| I got different guidance from the legal department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2441)|
| 0:40:44| about a year ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2444)|
| 0:40:45| so it's important to me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2445)|
| 0:40:47| that we continue this conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2447)|
| 0:40:49| I'll pass the mic for now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2449)|
| 0:40:51| but somebody else has a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2451)|
| 0:40:53| Council Member Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2453)|
| 0:40:57| There was discussion of the Granicus technology| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2457)|
| 0:41:02| used in this process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2462)|
| 0:41:05| and when looking on, for us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2465)|
| 0:41:08| it's page 11 of the handout,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2468)|
| 0:41:14| the slide show, case study number one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2474)|
| 0:41:17| noncompliant properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2477)|
| 0:41:20| The first step is identify noncompliant properties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2480)|
| 0:41:26| and I believe I heard you say 72%| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2486)|
| 0:41:30| of addresses have been identified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2490)|
| 0:41:33| Did I hear that correctly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2493)|
| 0:41:34| Can you speak directly into the mic?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2494)|
| 0:41:35| It's hard to hear you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2495)|
| 0:41:36| I'm having a hard time hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2496)|
| 0:41:37| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2497)|
| 0:41:41| So for, we're on page 11 of the handout.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2501)|
| 0:41:45| This is the slide that has case study number one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2505)|
| 0:41:49| noncompliant properties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2509)|
| 0:41:52| and the first block says| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2512)|
| 0:41:55| identify noncompliant properties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2515)|
| 0:41:58| and there was discussion about there being difficulty| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2518)|
| 0:42:01| with the Granicus technology with identifying properties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2521)|
| 0:42:06| but I think I heard 72% of the addresses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2526)|
| 0:42:10| have been identified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2530)|
| 0:42:12| I wouldn't say they've been identified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2532)|
| 0:42:13| Approximately 72% of the advertising STRs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2533)|
| 0:42:17| have their addresses listed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2537)|
| 0:42:19| Oh, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2539)|
| 0:42:20| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2540)|
| 0:42:21| Do we know how many noncompliant properties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2541)|
| 0:42:26| identified by Granicus have their addresses identified?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2546)|
| 0:42:31| We don't have that breakdown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2551)|
| 0:42:33| So essentially if the address,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2553)|
| 0:42:34| if you're one of the 30, 28% of properties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2554)|
| 0:42:38| that don't have your address specifically listed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2558)|
| 0:42:40| that is where Granicus is using kind of this wide net| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2560)|
| 0:42:44| and sending letters to probably more owners than they should| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2564)|
| 0:42:48| because they're trying to figure out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2568)|
| 0:42:50| where exactly in this block is this property located.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2570)|
| 0:42:53| So again, that 72% makes their job easy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2573)|
| 0:42:56| but when it doesn't have their address listed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2576)|
| 0:42:58| then we go into this kind of cast a wide net| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2578)|
| 0:43:01| and try to hone in on the noncompliant property itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2581)|
| 0:43:04| And what I'm trying to get a better understanding of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2584)|
| 0:43:08| is what happens in that process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2588)|
| 0:43:10| because later on in the presentation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2590)|
| 0:43:12| we see that all investigations have been closed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2592)|
| 0:43:16| but for these residences| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2596)|
| 0:43:21| that we're still unable to identify,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2601)|
| 0:43:23| do we have an idea of how many properties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2603)|
| 0:43:27| Granicus has identified?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2607)|
| 0:43:29| So we would know how much,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2609)|
| 0:43:31| if it's going to take manpower| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2611)|
| 0:43:33| and we can't rely on the technology,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2613)|
| 0:43:35| how many properties have been identified as noncompliant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2615)|
| 0:43:38| that we can't, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2618)|
| 0:43:41| hone in on this specific address to move it through the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2621)|
| 0:43:46| I think when we say those cases have been resolved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2626)|
| 0:43:50| that's not us giving up on finding the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2630)|
| 0:43:54| It's that they have come into compliance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2634)|
| 0:43:56| or stopped advertising.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2636)|
| 0:43:58| So I'm not sure if I'm totally following it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2638)|
| 0:44:02| but what you're saying is we start with a mystery.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2642)|
| 0:44:06| We start with a block where we say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2646)|
| 0:44:08| we think there's an STR in this general area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2648)|
| 0:44:10| We're going to send letters to the five households| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2650)|
| 0:44:13| where we think this is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2653)|
| 0:44:15| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2655)|
| 0:44:16| And what I think you're asking is that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2656)|
| 0:44:18| have we ever had a property that got all the way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2658)|
| 0:44:20| through the three letters| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2660)|
| 0:44:21| and we still haven't figured out where it is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2661)|
| 0:44:23| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2663)|
| 0:44:24| I think we have never had that happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2664)|
| 0:44:26| We have figured out where it is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2666)|
| 0:44:28| and that property has become compliant in some way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2668)|
| 0:44:32| with the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2672)|
| 0:44:33| Thank you for that, Claire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2673)|
| 0:44:35| Council Member McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2675)|
| 0:44:37| Thank you, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2677)|
| 0:44:39| So I want to ask a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2679)|
| 0:44:42| Do we ever cross-reference calls| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2682)|
| 0:44:44| that may have been placed to 911 or non-emergency| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2684)|
| 0:44:48| regarding noises and parties in a residential area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2688)|
| 0:44:52| and the person may not be calling the hotline| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2692)|
| 0:44:56| but go directly to KPD?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2696)|
| 0:44:59| Are those ever cross-referenced?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2699)|
| 0:45:01| They are when there's an investigation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2701)|
| 0:45:03| So, for example, we don't get a report from KPD.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2703)|
| 0:45:06| They have 300,000 calls, I think we learned in a past workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2706)|
| 0:45:10| We're not getting a report from them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2710)|
| 0:45:12| because they don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2712)|
| 0:45:14| They're responding to an emergency in real time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2714)|
| 0:45:16| However, if there is a complaint that comes in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2716)|
| 0:45:18| that references a situation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2718)|
| 0:45:20| Ms. McGrath can weigh in here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2720)|
| 0:45:22| but we will then, in investigating that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2722)|
| 0:45:25| we will call KPD, we will call 911,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2725)|
| 0:45:28| we will say, do you have any record of an incident| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2728)|
| 0:45:30| that occurred on whatever date it was alleged to take place?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2730)|
| 0:45:34| So we will use those tools in our investigation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2734)|
| 0:45:38| to corroborate a complaint,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2738)|
| 0:45:42| but we don't have an automated process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2742)|
| 0:45:45| for any time the cops go out to a party| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2745)|
| 0:45:48| that may or may not be being used as an STR.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2748)|
| 0:45:50| We're not getting that information from them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2750)|
| 0:45:52| We are seeking it from them in regards to a particular property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2752)|
| 0:45:55| and a particular complaint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2755)|
| 0:45:57| So, with that said, it sounds like there is a possibility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2757)|
| 0:46:00| that there are some complaints that are falling through the cracks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2760)|
| 0:46:03| because there may not ever be that cross-reference| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2763)|
| 0:46:05| that this is an Airbnb or this is a short-term rental.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2765)|
| 0:46:09| You guys would not necessarily know that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2769)|
| 0:46:11| unless the person were to call it into the hotline as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2771)|
| 0:46:14| The hotline is definitely the best place to report| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2774)|
| 0:46:16| a concern with a short-term rental.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2776)|
| 0:46:18| The cops, again, they are there to respond to a situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2778)|
| 0:46:22| If they find out that there's...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2782)|
| 0:46:25| Again, I mean, I think, Christina, maybe you'll speak to some examples,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2785)|
| 0:46:28| but they're not going out to ask| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2788)|
| 0:46:32| if the unit is being used as a short-term rental.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2792)|
| 0:46:34| They're responding to the situation at hand in real time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2794)|
| 0:46:38| So, let me second question because I'm on the clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2798)|
| 0:46:41| When we talk about the two types of the short-term rentals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2801)|
| 0:46:44| and there was reference to the person gets the permit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2804)|
| 0:46:48| and then they have to go around to their neighbours| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2808)|
| 0:46:50| and make sure that their neighbours are aware,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2810)|
| 0:46:52| how do we verify that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2812)|
| 0:46:54| Do the neighbours sign a petition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2814)|
| 0:46:56| or do we just go on the honour system of what they say?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2816)|
| 0:47:00| They have to, as part of their application,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2820)|
| 0:47:02| tell us who they contacted and they sign an affidavit that they did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2822)|
| 0:47:06| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2826)|
| 0:47:08| OK, I think I had another question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2828)|
| 0:47:11| I'll see if there's other questions and maybe come back. Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2831)|
| 0:47:14| Council Member Hugot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2834)|
| 0:47:16| Thank you. Since I just got one of those letters,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2836)|
| 0:47:19| I will tell you, nobody comes to your door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2839)|
| 0:47:21| Somebody sends you a letter that says you're in the proximate area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2841)|
| 0:47:25| that we may have one of these and that's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2845)|
| 0:47:28| I can't... There's nothing to say or do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2848)|
| 0:47:31| It's just that that's them saying that they notified the neighbours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2851)|
| 0:47:35| I hope that doesn't count in my minutes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2855)|
| 0:47:37| but I'm just answering questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2857)|
| 0:47:39| So, my question to...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2859)|
| 0:47:43| Well, a couple of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2863)|
| 0:47:45| To Councilman Smith, I think one reason they may have tried to say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2865)|
| 0:47:50| that renters could not rent...could not do sub-rent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2870)|
| 0:47:55| because the owner of the property has the agreement with the renter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2875)|
| 0:47:59| and it could be to protect the owner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2879)|
| 0:48:01| so that their property was not being sublet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2881)|
| 0:48:04| and additional damage happening to their house, perhaps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2884)|
| 0:48:07| I'm just throwing that out as some logic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2887)|
| 0:48:09| that might have been used when Council wrote it the first time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2889)|
| 0:48:14| The next question I have is about proof of ownership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2894)|
| 0:48:20| It seems to me that there's a lot of opportunity for fraud in that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2900)|
| 0:48:26| because you can keep an old ID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2906)|
| 0:48:31| You could not live in a resident.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2911)|
| 0:48:33| You could move and you could say that it was your primary residence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2913)|
| 0:48:38| and prove to the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2918)|
| 0:48:40| you don't change your voter registration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2920)|
| 0:48:42| and you don't do those kind of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2922)|
| 0:48:44| It would be very hard to catch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2924)|
| 0:48:47| So, I do think there are instances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2927)|
| 0:48:49| when homes are not occupied by the owner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2929)|
| 0:48:55| but people present proof as though it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2935)|
| 0:48:58| And so I think that is...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2938)|
| 0:49:01| I don't know how we tighten that up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2941)|
| 0:49:03| but that is a legitimate frustration that happens in neighbourhoods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2943)|
| 0:49:09| because the neighbours know someone's not living there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2949)|
| 0:49:13| and yet they come before and present proof as though they are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2953)|
| 0:49:18| So, I don't know how we tighten that loophole,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2958)|
| 0:49:21| but that causes citizens to not have faith in the ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2961)|
| 0:49:25| and that we are not protecting and enforcing the ordinances that we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2965)|
| 0:49:30| So, I just want to speak to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2970)|
| 0:49:33| And my other question is how much a permit costs to get.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2973)|
| 0:49:39| Who sets that rate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2979)|
| 0:49:40| Is that by ordinance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2980)|
| 0:49:42| Does it rise for inflation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2982)|
| 0:49:44| Is it controlled by the state like everything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2984)|
| 0:49:50| We're confirming, but it's set by ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2990)|
| 0:49:53| By our local ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2993)|
| 0:49:55| So, if the permit fee has been this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=2995)|
| 0:50:00| we could raise the permit fee if we wanted to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=3000)|
| 0:50:02| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=3002)|
| 0:50:03| We could raise the permit fee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=3003)|
| 0:50:05| I would ask Ms. O'Hara how a fee would interact with our regulations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=3005)|
| 0:50:12| and whether there would be any legacy privileges,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=3012)|
| 0:50:15| but we could raise it, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=3015)|
| 0:50:17| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=3017)|
| 0:50:18| I mean, I understand we'd have to go through the law department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=3018)|
| 0:50:20| to see if it triggered anything else,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=3020)|
| 0:50:22| but there's nothing in the state statute that prevents us from raising| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=3022)|
| 0:50:26| permit fees as it stands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=3026)|
| 0:50:30| No, not that I'm aware of at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=3030)|
| 0:50:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=3032)|
| 0:50:33| And then following up on Councilwoman McKenzie's point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=3033)|
| 0:50:40| I would really like to see us find a way to cross-reference noise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=3040)|
| 0:50:46| and complaint calls from KPD by address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=3046)|
| 0:50:50| Because if we have permits and we know these things are ST,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=3050)|
| 0:50:53| short-term rentals, and I guarantee you 90% of citizens have no idea| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=3053)|
| 0:51:00| to call a hotline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=3060)|
| 0:51:03| They don't even know a hotline exists.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=3063)|
| 0:51:05| They are calling the police when they hear stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=3065)|
| 0:51:07| So, I also think that's where some frustration with neighbors come in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=3067)|
| 0:51:14| So, I just wish there would be a way that we could find the technology| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=3074)|
| 0:51:19| because we may find more problems than we think we have based on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=3079)|
| 0:51:24| anecdotal conversations from residents who live near these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=3084)|
| 0:51:32| Councilmember Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=3092)|
| 0:51:34| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=3094)|
| 0:51:36| I'm going to answer some questions and ask some questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=3096)|
| 0:51:39| Councilman Smith, I don't recall having conversations in 2017 because we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=3099)|
| 0:51:44| were campaigning at the time about why renters were omitted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=3104)|
| 0:51:48| But I can say as a landlord myself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=3108)|
| 0:51:51| I appreciate that the city does not offer permits to renters because I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=3111)|
| 0:51:57| would never be okay with my tenants renting short-term rental.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=3117)|
| 0:52:02| The liability of that scares the pants off of me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=3122)|
| 0:52:05| I know my tenants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=3125)|
| 0:52:08| I can do background checks on them before they move in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=3128)|
| 0:52:13| Yeah, there's just so many things that go into that as a landlord that I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=3133)|
| 0:52:16| just would not be okay with that at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=3136)|
| 0:52:19| So, I don't even want to get into that business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=3139)|
| 0:52:22| And I feel like the liability of that can run back on the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=3142)|
| 0:52:25| It's the same thing where we've had instances in the past,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=3145)|
| 0:52:28| not the city per se, but where somebody applies for a zoning change for a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=3148)|
| 0:52:32| property they don't own.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=3152)|
| 0:52:34| You have to get the property owner to sign off on something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=3154)|
| 0:52:37| That just goes into a strange territory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=3157)|
| 0:52:40| So, anyway, that's just my personal thoughts on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=3160)|
| 0:52:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=3165)|
| 0:52:47| Can we talk for a minute about the revocation part that you guys touched| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=3167)|
| 0:52:52| on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=3172)|
| 0:52:53| Because I think that complicates some things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=3173)|
| 0:52:57| So, the state law that was passed after the city ordinance that went into| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=3177)|
| 0:53:03| effect January 2018.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=3183)|
| 0:53:06| That's when the city law went into effect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=3186)|
| 0:53:09| So, Ms. McGraw, I don't know who wants to comment on the revocation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=3189)|
| 0:53:15| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=3195)|
| 0:53:16| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=3196)|
| 0:53:17| I missed the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=3197)|
| 0:53:18| So, yes, the city ordinance went into effect in January 2018.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=3198)|
| 0:53:21| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=3201)|
| 0:53:22| And then five months later, the state statute came into effect and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=3202)|
| 0:53:26| preempted the field except for what they have allowed in the statute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=3206)|
| 0:53:32| And one of those authorities that was granted to local governments was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=3212)|
| 0:53:37| to revoke or not allow the continued use of, as the language used in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=3217)|
| 0:53:43| statute, if they have violated three separate times of generally| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=3223)|
| 0:53:50| applicable laws and those violations have a direct relation to the use as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=3230)|
| 0:53:55| a short-term rental unit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=3235)|
| 0:53:57| It's very complicated and technical and coming up with examples of that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=3237)|
| 0:54:01| is fairly difficult.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=3241)|
| 0:54:02| That's why I use the noise ordinance because it applies to the entire city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=3242)|
| 0:54:06| and it's something that may happen more frequently if a house is being used| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=3246)|
| 0:54:09| for events or something like of that nature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=3249)|
| 0:54:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=3254)|
| 0:54:15| So, I'm not sure I'm understanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=3255)|
| 0:54:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=3259)|
| 0:54:20| So, let me back up or ask in a slightly different way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=3260)|
| 0:54:24| The FAQ that's on the city website, there were some recent changes to that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=3264)|
| 0:54:29| correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=3269)|
| 0:54:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=3270)|
| 0:54:31| So, one of the things that was changed is on the next to the last item of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=3271)|
| 0:54:38| FAQ, what is the process for renewing the permit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=3278)|
| 0:54:43| Notification of the need to renew will be sent by the city to each operator.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=3283)|
| 0:54:48| The operator will need to pay the $50 renewal fee by the appropriate date on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=3288)|
| 0:54:52| the notification to remain compliant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=3292)|
| 0:54:55| So, there was some language in there about proof you've maintained residency,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=3295)|
| 0:55:01| something about similar to the first time you applied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=3301)|
| 0:55:04| So, some of that language got removed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=3304)|
| 0:55:06| Can you explain to me why that got removed, what that's tied to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=3306)|
| 0:55:11| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=3311)|
| 0:55:12| I'd be happy to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=3312)|
| 0:55:13| So, this really stemmed from a discussion we had with some of the folks here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=3313)|
| 0:55:18| tonight, and I think you received some summary of our exchange with several| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=3318)|
| 0:55:23| internship members of the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=3323)|
| 0:55:25| But, in particular, they raised our attention to the fact that there was a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=3325)|
| 0:55:28| discrepancy between our FAQ and how it was described in terms of submitting an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=3328)|
| 0:55:33| application, a new application for renewal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=3333)|
| 0:55:36| And so, we acknowledge that, yes, that is a discrepancy, and we updated our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=3336)|
| 0:55:40| FAQ to reflect the current practice as it is done today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=3340)|
| 0:55:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=3345)|
| 0:55:46| So, let me go back to the revocation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=3346)|
| 0:55:49| If someone, I feel like I misheard something, or I just need you to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=3349)|
| 0:55:52| yes, you heard that correctly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=3352)|
| 0:55:54| If I own a property and I get a Type I permit for an Airbnb, but then let's say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=3354)|
| 0:56:02| I get married or I buy another property or whatever my situation changes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=3362)|
| 0:56:06| I move out, you can't revoke my Type I permit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=3366)|
| 0:56:11| I get to keep it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=3371)|
| 0:56:13| So, that's a little bit of a different question because that has to do with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=3373)|
| 0:56:16| eligibility related to permit status.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=3376)|
| 0:56:20| The things that we are talking about in terms of revocation specifically have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=3380)|
| 0:56:24| to do more with conduct issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=3384)|
| 0:56:26| So, for instance, trash and noise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=3386)|
| 0:56:28| Does that make sense?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=3388)|
| 0:56:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=3389)|
| 0:56:30| But once you give me a Type I permit and I declare to you that's my primary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=3390)|
| 0:56:34| residence and you look at my documentation and I got a permit, but then it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=3394)|
| 0:56:39| time for me to renew my permit, you're going to renew my permit because you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=3399)|
| 0:56:43| can't take my permit away as long as my conduct is good or my renter's conduct| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=3403)|
| 0:56:47| is good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=3407)|
| 0:56:48| Is that my misunderstanding?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=3408)|
| 0:56:49| If you failed to provide your documentation, then you would not be granted a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=3409)|
| 0:56:55| renewal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=3415)|
| 0:57:01| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=3421)|
| 0:57:02| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=3422)|
| 0:57:03| I'm Donna Dyer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=3423)|
| 0:57:04| I think you're – I understand your question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=3424)|
| 0:57:06| Unless we are – it's brought to our attention, you're only going to pay your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=3426)|
| 0:57:10| renewal fee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=3430)|
| 0:57:11| If we are –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=3431)|
| 0:57:12| You're not – even though our ordinance says you're re-looking at my documents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=3432)|
| 0:57:15| you're not re-looking at my documents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=3435)|
| 0:57:18| I don't –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=3438)|
| 0:57:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=3439)|
| 0:57:20| I'll go look.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=3440)|
| 0:57:21| I'll speak to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=3441)|
| 0:57:22| I think it says may.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=3442)|
| 0:57:23| I'm not sure about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=3443)|
| 0:57:24| But we are not looking at additional documents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=3444)|
| 0:57:27| If we receive a complaint that says they were not leaving there or there is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=3447)|
| 0:57:31| some issue, then we will start an investigation and look at the ownership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=3451)|
| 0:57:36| If the ownership has changed, then we would close the permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=3456)|
| 0:57:40| And if we – Christina may ask for additional residency requirements in that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=3460)|
| 0:57:49| situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=3469)|
| 0:57:50| So we would determine, based on what that complaint is, what our next steps are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=3470)|
| 0:57:54| in that investigation process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=3474)|
| 0:57:56| But without a complaint, a renewal is a payment of a fee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=3476)|
| 0:58:00| Two things, if I may.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=3480)|
| 0:58:02| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=3482)|
| 0:58:03| Our ordinance, first off, does not require us to re-verify residency as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=3483)|
| 0:58:09| currently written.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=3489)|
| 0:58:11| However, every time we get a complaint that someone is not actually residing in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=3491)|
| 0:58:15| the unit, we do, you know, open a file, we do an investigation, we reach out to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=3495)|
| 0:58:20| the operator or the owner, whoever is holding the permit, and we say, here are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=3500)|
| 0:58:24| the complaints made against you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=3504)|
| 0:58:26| Please provide us with additional evidence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=3506)|
| 0:58:28| And that was what Ms. Gill mentioned earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=3508)|
| 0:58:32| You know, frequently what we have found is that the short-term rental operators| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=3512)|
| 0:58:36| or owners, permit holders, they are willing not only to provide additional| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=3516)|
| 0:58:40| documentation above what was required in the ordinance, but then also additional| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=3520)|
| 0:58:46| documents, for instance, a utility bill or something of that nature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=3526)|
| 0:58:50| Well, of course the utility bill is going to be in their name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=3530)|
| 0:58:53| Well, that's just one example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=3533)|
| 0:58:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=3535)|
| 0:58:56| I've got other folks I can ask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=3536)|
| 0:58:57| I'm going to let other people ask questions, but a utility bill is not a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=3537)|
| 0:59:00| way to verify ownership or residency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=3540)|
| 0:59:03| They own it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=3543)|
| 0:59:04| Of course they're paying utilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=3544)|
| 0:59:07| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=3547)|
| 0:59:08| Council Member Testerman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=3548)|
| 0:59:10| Thank you, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=3550)|
| 0:59:12| So a couple of things, and obviously we've received a great deal of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=3552)|
| 0:59:17| information, so I have tried to comb through it as thoroughly as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=3557)|
| 0:59:24| So have we to date revoked any permits?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=3564)|
| 0:59:29| We have not revoked any permits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=3569)|
| 0:59:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=3572)|
| 0:59:33| And back to the renewal process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=3573)|
| 0:59:35| So the process is we send out a renewal notice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=3575)|
| 0:59:42| Is the onus on the owner to know when his renewal is up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=3582)|
| 0:59:49| We send out a renewal notice, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=3589)|
| 0:59:52| Via mail or?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=3592)|

| 0:59:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=3594)|
| 0:59:55| And then what's the time frame for them to comply?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=3595)|
| 1:00:03| The onus is on the permit holder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=3603)|
| 1:00:06| As a courtesy, because we want to notify them, we do send the notice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=3606)|
| 1:00:11| But that's not receiving a renewal notice is not a reason to not have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=3611)|
| 1:00:16| renewed your permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=3616)|
| 1:00:18| Your permit tells you when it expires and you have a period of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=3618)|
| 1:00:24| I believe it's 15 days from the expire date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=3624)|
| 1:00:27| If you do not renew it, then your permit is closed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=3627)|
| 1:00:30| Is there a method to do an auto renewal of some kind?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=3630)|
| 1:00:34| I'm sorry?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=3634)|
| 1:00:35| Like an auto renewal of some kind?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=3635)|
| 1:00:37| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=3637)|
| 1:00:38| And then they have how long to pay or, I mean, I guess where I'm going is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=3638)|
| 1:00:46| if they don't renew, let's just say it's just not on their radar| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=3646)|
| 1:00:51| and they continue to operate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=3651)|
| 1:00:54| Well, then we would notify our host compliance that they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=3654)|
| 1:00:59| no longer have a permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=3659)|
| 1:01:01| If they're continuing to advertise, then it would start the process again| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=3661)|
| 1:01:06| of receiving letters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=3666)|
| 1:01:08| And if they then say, oh, we didn't renew,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=3668)|
| 1:01:11| they would just have to start the application process again| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=3671)|
| 1:01:14| and obtain a new permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=3674)|
| 1:01:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=3677)|
| 1:01:18| And so in that period, 30 days or something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=3678)|
| 1:01:22| Yeah, it could take some time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=3682)|
| 1:01:24| Thirty days is the first letter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=3684)|
| 1:01:26| They have 30 days to respond on the first letter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=3686)|
| 1:01:29| And then a second letter goes out after 30 days?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=3689)|
| 1:01:32| It does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=3692)|
| 1:01:33| And then what's the waiting period for that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=3693)|
| 1:01:36| We typically wait 30 days between each letter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=3696)|
| 1:01:39| And then they get three letters, is that correct, or something of that nature?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=3699)|
| 1:01:43| Yes, so they could be operating without a permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=3703)|
| 1:01:46| I'm speaking out, but it is to note that they are still collecting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=3706)|
| 1:01:51| the occupancy tax and the sales tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=3711)|
| 1:01:53| If they're renting, even without a permit, all of that is still collected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=3713)|
| 1:01:58| So the revenue is still coming to the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=3718)|
| 1:02:00| even if they're operating without a permit in that time period| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=3720)|
| 1:02:04| while we are in the attempt to identify them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=3724)|
| 1:02:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=3727)|
| 1:02:09| Another question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=3729)|
| 1:02:11| I'm aware that some of the rental companies have shored up their language| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=3731)|
| 1:02:17| to, you know, try and do a better job saying, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=3737)|
| 1:02:24| certain STRs cannot advertise as party houses or, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=3744)|
| 1:02:30| a lot of times one night holiday, you know, popular holidays,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=3750)|
| 1:02:34| that type of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=3754)|
| 1:02:36| Is there any type of reporting structure that we have within our department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=3756)|
| 1:02:41| to say that there is a bad actor or a problem situation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=3761)|
| 1:02:47| that we have an added layer of accountability?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=3767)|
| 1:02:51| Is somebody communicating with the actual rental company themselves to say?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=3771)|
| 1:03:01| So I'm not sure if I'm following your question, but, yes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=3781)|
| 1:03:03| I mean, in all cases where we have documented that there's been an issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=3783)|
| 1:03:07| we are in communication with the permit operator| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=3787)|
| 1:03:10| to say that there has been an issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=3790)|
| 1:03:12| What steps are you going to take to resolve this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=3792)|
| 1:03:14| so that it doesn't happen in the future?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=3794)|
| 1:03:16| And that's that reference around, hey,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=3796)|
| 1:03:18| your neighbor's just accused you of leaving your trash all over the place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=3798)|
| 1:03:21| and the operator responded to that by saying, oh, I'm so sorry,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=3801)|
| 1:03:25| let me tighten up the language so that my guests know the rules around trash.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=3805)|
| 1:03:31| So I'm not sure if that's addressing your point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=3811)|
| 1:03:33| but we are in that communication,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=3813)|
| 1:03:35| and that is one of the ways that the permit holders| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=3815)|
| 1:03:39| have resolved these concerns when they have come up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=3819)|
| 1:03:42| because they have recognized that they can do better| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=3822)|
| 1:03:44| and they can hold their guests to a higher standard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=3824)|
| 1:03:47| and that's one of the opportunities to resolve a complaint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=3827)|
| 1:03:50| And I guess also adding into that factor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=3830)|
| 1:03:52| let's just say it's Airbnb or HomeAway or whatever it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=3832)|
| 1:03:57| Is there any communication with that platform| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=3837)|
| 1:04:01| if we encounter a bad actor or a problem situation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=3841)|
| 1:04:05| Do we talk to Airbnb directly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=3845)|
| 1:04:08| No. We don't work with the platforms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=3848)|
| 1:04:10| We work with the permit holders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=3850)|
| 1:04:12| Right. Okay. All right. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=3852)|
| 1:04:16| Council Member Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=3856)|
| 1:04:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=3860)|
| 1:04:23| So a couple of questions have come up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=3863)|
| 1:04:26| since the conversation has continued,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=3866)|
| 1:04:29| and I just want to go back briefly to the permit renewal process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=3869)|
| 1:04:35| and get a better understanding of why the language| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=3875)|
| 1:04:38| that's currently in the ordinance has not been sufficient| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=3878)|
| 1:04:43| to indicate that it was the intention of council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=3883)|
| 1:04:46| that an application be submitted for each renewal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=3886)|
| 1:04:51| not just the permit fee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=3891)|
| 1:04:55| Are you referencing ordinance language| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=3895)|
| 1:04:57| or are you referencing our FAQ language?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=3897)|
| 1:04:59| Yeah, the ordinance language.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=3899)|
| 1:05:01| The way I read it is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=3901)|
| 1:05:03| an application for renewal of a unit permit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=3903)|
| 1:05:06| shall be made through the business license and tax office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=3906)|
| 1:05:11| That's an application. I see what you're saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=3911)|
| 1:05:14| Okay. Yeah, and this is one of the conversations that we had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=3914)|
| 1:05:16| I mean, again, our standard practice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=3916)|
| 1:05:18| is that we want to renew the permits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=3918)|
| 1:05:20| If they're not a poorly performing property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=3920)|
| 1:05:23| we want to make it a customer-friendly experience| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=3923)|
| 1:05:26| to go through this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=3926)|
| 1:05:28| One of the things that we have talked about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=3928)|
| 1:05:30| is this idea of documentation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=3930)|
| 1:05:32| around the owner occupancy requirements specifically,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=3932)|
| 1:05:35| given that that, as we've experienced,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=3935)|
| 1:05:38| has been one of the most troubling aspects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=3938)|
| 1:05:42| And I want to go back to the fact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=3942)|
| 1:05:44| that it will not solve all of our problems| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=3944)|
| 1:05:47| to get those additional documentations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=3947)|
| 1:05:48| because we are really limited to how we define occupancy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=3948)|
| 1:05:52| being that documentation and the specific,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=3952)|
| 1:05:54| I think it's five, options that folks have to provide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=3954)|
| 1:05:58| So, again, even in a situation where the neighbors are saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=3958)|
| 1:06:02| this person doesn't live here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=3962)|
| 1:06:04| if they're still on the deed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=3964)|
| 1:06:06| and they're producing those documents...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=3966)|
| 1:06:08| Deputy Gill, can you talk into the mic?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=3968)|
| 1:06:09| Oh, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=3969)|
| 1:06:10| If they are still on the deed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=3970)|
| 1:06:11| and they're producing those documents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=3971)|
| 1:06:12| then that's going to be allowable under our ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=3972)|
| 1:06:16| But it sounds like that's not even being checked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=3976)|
| 1:06:19| We do not do that on a regular basis upon renewal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=3979)|
| 1:06:22| It is something we could do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=3982)|
| 1:06:24| I want to, again, recognize just the labor involved with this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=3984)|
| 1:06:27| and the staff that any trade-off| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=3987)|
| 1:06:30| between what you do versus what you take is good faith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=3990)|
| 1:06:34| So it is something that we've talked about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=3994)|
| 1:06:36| and that we continue to evaluate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=3996)|
| 1:06:38| But, again, I just want to recognize| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=3998)|
| 1:06:40| that some of the situations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=4000)|
| 1:06:44| that we have talked about with neighbors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=4004)|
| 1:06:46| has been around what I would call| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=4006)|
| 1:06:50| very difficult to prove| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=4010)|
| 1:06:53| around this occupancy piece and residency| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=4013)|
| 1:06:55| because we are very specific| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=4015)|
| 1:06:57| in how we define occupancy based on documentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=4017)|
| 1:07:01| It's not the number of days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=4021)|
| 1:07:03| that you lay your head on your pillow in a certain month| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=4023)|
| 1:07:06| or how many days your car is in the driveway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=4026)|
| 1:07:08| It's about can you produce| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=4028)|
| 1:07:10| two of these five pieces of paper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=4030)|
| 1:07:13| And I hear you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=4033)|
| 1:07:15| And it sounds like there is more work to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=4035)|
| 1:07:17| to make sure that this ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=4037)|
| 1:07:19| can be enforced as intended when adopted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=4039)|
| 1:07:25| But to not even implement part of the ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=4045)|
| 1:07:33| because it doesn't seem like a good use of time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=4053)|
| 1:07:38| it concerns me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=4058)|
| 1:07:41| because I don't feel that discretion is written in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=4061)|
| 1:07:44| I feel like the ordinance is clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=4064)|
| 1:07:46| But perhaps we do need to make some things more clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=4066)|
| 1:07:49| One question I do have is about Granicus| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=4069)|
| 1:07:53| and the cost of Granicus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=4073)|
| 1:07:55| Oh, that's a good question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=4075)|
| 1:07:58| I know originally it was around| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=4078)|
| 1:08:00| maybe a little less than $30,000 per year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=4080)|
| 1:08:04| We think it's around $25,000 a year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=4084)|
| 1:08:07| for that software performance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=4087)|
| 1:08:10| Because I wonder if we can look into ways| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=4090)|
| 1:08:14| we can expand our use of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=4094)|
| 1:08:18| I'm thinking about cross-referencing those 911 calls| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=4098)|
| 1:08:22| because if we're not doing that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=4102)|
| 1:08:25| I don't see how we're going to identify violations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=4105)|
| 1:08:28| except through the complaint process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=4108)|
| 1:08:31| when folks are calling the actual number provided.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=4111)|
| 1:08:35| But without doing some sort of cross-referencing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=4115)|
| 1:08:37| of the 911 calls| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=4117)|
| 1:08:40| I worry we won't be able to identify violations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=4120)|
| 1:08:43| And specifically, I think I'm using the right term,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=4123)|
| 1:08:46| the state's term| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=4126)|
| 1:08:51| for violations of our general ordinances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=4131)|
| 1:08:58| not necessarily against our short-term rental ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=4138)|
| 1:09:02| And then the last thing I just wanted to say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=4142)|
| 1:09:06| since I only have a few seconds left is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=4146)|
| 1:09:08| I am a little conflicted on the renters issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=4148)|
| 1:09:11| And I'm interested in more discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=4151)|
| 1:09:14| I was someone who was able to sublet my apartment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=4154)|
| 1:09:18| when I was a law student for a week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=4158)|
| 1:09:21| And I don't know if I followed regulations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=4161)|
| 1:09:23| but it was really easy to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=4163)|
| 1:09:25| And I imagine students here are probably already doing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=4165)|
| 1:09:29| So it would be good to allow students to get permits, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=4169)|
| 1:09:33| Possibly. It should be something to discuss.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=4173)|
| 1:09:37| Can I chime in and just make two very quick points?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=4177)|
| 1:09:40| So I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=4180)|
| 1:09:42| And I guess maybe as you all are discussing this 911 piece| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=4182)|
| 1:09:45| I want to emphasize, and the lawyers to my right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=4185)|
| 1:09:49| will correct me if this is incorrect,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=4189)|
| 1:09:51| but the law also is very clear that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=4191)|
| 1:09:53| it's not about cross-referencing calls on a particular property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=4193)|
| 1:09:59| Those calls have to be specific to its use as a short-term rental| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=4199)|
| 1:10:03| in order to be relevant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=4203)|
| 1:10:05| So it is very specific.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=4205)|
| 1:10:08| It's not just about, oh, yeah, the cops went to this address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=4208)|
| 1:10:10| Well, the cops went to this address because the owner was there having a party| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=4210)|
| 1:10:12| not because a short-term rental occupant was there having a party.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=4212)|
| 1:10:16| So I want to just be clear on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=4216)|
| 1:10:18| And then the other just kind of nuanced point around the ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=4218)|
| 1:10:21| and I appreciate, again, this is why we have talked about this internally,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=4221)|
| 1:10:24| is this option that we have to request documentation upon renewal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=4224)|
| 1:10:30| as something that we could pursue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=4230)|
| 1:10:32| But I also want to emphasize that the ordinance doesn't obligate us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=4232)|
| 1:10:35| to have an application for renewal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=4235)|
| 1:10:37| It's about the application process is spelled out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=4237)|
| 1:10:40| The renewal process is a little more open-ended, if you will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=4240)|
| 1:10:44| But I appreciate that perspective because I think it is an option| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=4244)|
| 1:10:48| that we have discussed around that additional documentation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=4248)|
| 1:10:54| being resubmitted as part of that renewal process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=4254)|
| 1:11:00| One member of the panel up here was actually here in 2018,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=4260)|
| 1:11:05| and he wanted to provide some perspective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=4265)|
| 1:11:07| Mr. Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=4267)|
| 1:11:08| Thank you, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=4268)|
| 1:11:11| I'm sure, yes, Mr. Johnson as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=4271)|
| 1:11:13| I'm sure actually Mr. Johnson could get the recording of the workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=4273)|
| 1:11:17| It was a very lengthy discussion on short-term rentals back in 2018.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=4277)|
| 1:11:22| My general recollection, knowing that it's been four years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=4282)|
| 1:11:25| is that there was a desire to have a smaller number of type 1 rentals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=4285)|
| 1:11:34| available versus a type 2 based on the type of zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=4294)|
| 1:11:40| Also, I would like to point out, members of council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=4300)|
| 1:11:44| if there is a complaint by somebody about a short-term rental,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=4304)|
| 1:11:50| whether or not they're in compliance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=4310)|
| 1:11:53| some neighborhoods have deed restrictions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=4313)|
| 1:11:57| Those deed restrictions will not be enforced by the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=4317)|
| 1:12:02| State law, not enforcing them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=4322)|
| 1:12:05| City ordinances, not enforcing them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=4325)|
| 1:12:08| For example, I'll just pick Holston Hills, for example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=4328)|
| 1:12:12| Even though a lot of people think of Holston Hills as one big neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=4332)|
| 1:12:15| it's probably developed in different parts, different periods of times,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=4335)|
| 1:12:20| with possibly different deed restrictions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=4340)|
| 1:12:24| Sometimes those deed restrictions will limit the use as a rental for short terms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=4344)|
| 1:12:33| Unfortunately, for most people, that will involve reviewing what's in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=4353)|
| 1:12:39| the Knox County Register of Deeds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=4359)|
| 1:12:41| It might take hiring of an attorney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=4361)|
| 1:12:44| It is possible that the city would grant a short-term rental permit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=4364)|
| 1:12:48| and not know about the deed restriction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=4368)|
| 1:12:50| and the city's not charged with knowing about the deed restrictions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=4370)|
| 1:12:54| But I'm aware of a situation, a fairly recent past,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=4374)|
| 1:12:58| outside the city of Knoxville where some neighbors did end a rental situation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=4378)|
| 1:13:04| because it was contrary to the deed restrictions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=4384)|
| 1:13:08| and that neighborhood had been around 50-plus years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=4388)|
| 1:13:12| So there might be another way that these short-term rentals might need to comply.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=4392)|
| 1:13:23| Council Member Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=4403)|
| 1:13:24| Thank you, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=4404)|
| 1:13:26| While STR platforms do not always provide or display the exact address for a property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=4406)|
| 1:13:32| when they're being marketed, they obviously have those addresses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=4412)|
| 1:13:37| And I was curious whether other cities require STR platforms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=4417)|
| 1:13:41| to provide them those exact addresses after a reservation is made, for example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=4421)|
| 1:13:52| I don't know of any authority for the city to be able to require a platform| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=4432)|
| 1:13:55| to provide that information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=4435)|
| 1:13:58| Doesn't STR platforms pay a fee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=4438)|
| 1:14:03| No?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=4443)|
| 1:14:05| They remit the taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=4445)|
| 1:14:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=4447)|
| 1:14:08| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=4448)|
| 1:14:09| I didn't know that other cities had required that for them to operate in the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=4449)|
| 1:14:12| that they're in or states.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=4452)|
| 1:14:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=4455)|
| 1:14:16| I don't know of any authority for the city of Knoxville to require that of a platform.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=4456)|
| 1:14:20| There's nothing granting you the authority to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=4460)|
| 1:14:24| At a state level, it might be out there somewhere, yeah?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=4464)|
| 1:14:30| I don't think the state has taken that action to require that for them to operate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=4470)|
| 1:14:36| And their business license would be through the state and just for the platform,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=4476)|
| 1:14:39| not necessarily for the individual units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=4479)|
| 1:14:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=4482)|
| 1:14:43| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=4483)|
| 1:14:44| And I want to follow up on the renters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=4484)|
| 1:14:45| And the reason I bring this up is because I've had a number of people in my district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=4485)|
| 1:14:48| that have asked me to do this legally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=4488)|
| 1:14:52| And so they're trying to follow the rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=4492)|
| 1:14:55| And one scenario is somebody that's in the military,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=4495)|
| 1:14:58| and so they rent a home in Knoxville and then they go away for a week or a month| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=4498)|
| 1:15:04| and would like to rent it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=4504)|
| 1:15:07| So that's a scenario where it's happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=4507)|
| 1:15:10| I've also – a traveling nurse has asked me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=4510)|
| 1:15:13| They rent to apply for this in a residential neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=4513)|
| 1:15:19| So that's why I bring it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=4519)|
| 1:15:22| I also know that in the code, at least for the commercial districts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=4522)|
| 1:15:25| the owner of the properties are required to sign a form that allows the lessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=4525)|
| 1:15:30| to apply for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=4530)|
| 1:15:34| So there's liability there that's taken care of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=4534)|
| 1:15:40| The city, as part of its code for the commercial districts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=4540)|
| 1:15:42| have taken care of its liability in that regard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=4542)|
| 1:15:46| And I think that if somebody in a commercial area that rents a property is able to do this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=4546)|
| 1:15:52| I don't see why in a residential area a renter should be limited from making money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=4552)|
| 1:15:58| on their property responsibly using these regulations to make a little extra income,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=4558)|
| 1:16:04| not any less safe for the property owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=4564)|
| 1:16:07| And actually the way this came to me was from the property owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=4567)|
| 1:16:11| So they own 10 or 15 property owners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=4571)|
| 1:16:13| They had a couple renters that this applied for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=4573)|
| 1:16:16| and he wanted to enable them to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=4576)|
| 1:16:18| And I don't think renters are any more a risk to the city or to the public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=4578)|
| 1:16:23| in a residential area as in a commercial area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=4583)|
| 1:16:26| So that's why I keep bringing it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=4586)|
| 1:16:29| Council Member Fugate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=4589)|
| 1:16:34| Lord, I listened to that and forgot my fault.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=4594)|
| 1:16:40| Come back to me, Andrew.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=4600)|
| 1:16:41| As soon as Charlie starts speaking, I'll remember.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=4601)|
| 1:16:45| Council Member Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=4605)|
| 1:16:48| More of a comment than anything else,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=4608)|
| 1:16:49| and I do this on behalf of constituents that have contacted me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=4609)|
| 1:16:54| and they are very frustrated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=4614)|
| 1:16:56| And looking at the statistics, of course, this has been in effect for four years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=4616)|
| 1:17:02| Currently we have 447 operating permits, and not a single permit has been revoked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=4622)|
| 1:17:10| And constituents tell me that they know, and I believe them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=4630)|
| 1:17:16| that too many of the people who have permits are not living on that property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=4636)|
| 1:17:22| They are not abiding by the residency requirement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=4642)|
| 1:17:27| and they feel like they're almost just flaunting it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=4647)|
| 1:17:32| that they're openly not living there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=4652)|
| 1:17:36| And it's really, really frustrating for these neighbors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=4656)|
| 1:17:41| who are having to, of course, put up with these permit holders| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=4661)|
| 1:17:47| who aren't abiding by the requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=4667)|
| 1:17:51| And you get the whole litany of traffic and noise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=4671)|
| 1:17:55| and kind of disruption in the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=4675)|
| 1:17:59| And I don't know what the answer is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=4679)|
| 1:18:02| And I do know that there's an obstacle there with the hoops| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=4682)|
| 1:18:07| that the city has to jump through by the requirements of the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=4687)|
| 1:18:11| It's a process to revoke a permit, and it's not easy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=4691)|
| 1:18:15| And it would be easier if we had all that authority was in our domain, but it's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=4695)|
| 1:18:22| So I do understand these obstacles that we don't have control of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=4702)|
| 1:18:30| but I don't have the answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=4710)|
| 1:18:33| But we are going to have to do something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=4713)|
| 1:18:35| and look really, really hard at enforcing these mainly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=4715)|
| 1:18:40| I think the number one problem is the residency requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=4720)|
| 1:18:43| That's what I'm hearing from my constituents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=4723)|
| 1:18:46| And I don't know if there's some way we can put something punitive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=4726)|
| 1:18:51| in the ordinance where there would be other consequences| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=4731)|
| 1:18:58| other than just revoking the permit for falsifying information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=4738)|
| 1:19:04| or presenting documents of residency when they aren't living there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=4744)|
| 1:19:08| or if it has to go back to, for example, the election commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=4748)|
| 1:19:13| if somebody's claiming that they're living at a particular residence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=4753)|
| 1:19:18| and they have their voter ID from that residence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=4758)|
| 1:19:23| when they're not living there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=4763)|
| 1:19:25| But that's kind of a separate authority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=4765)|
| 1:19:27| I'm just kind of brainstorming ways that we can more effectively enforce this problem| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=4767)|
| 1:19:34| that's obviously out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=4774)|
| 1:19:38| I mean, people know their neighborhoods,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=4778)|
| 1:19:41| and they know when people aren't living there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=4781)|
| 1:19:44| So this is more of a comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=4784)|
| 1:19:47| This is really complex.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=4787)|
| 1:19:49| It's not easy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=4789)|
| 1:19:51| But I don't think we can go on just like this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=4791)|
| 1:19:55| because the enforcement mechanism is not working as much as it should.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=4795)|
| 1:20:02| So I'll turn it over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=4802)|
| 1:20:04| I know that, Council, one of the reasons we wanted to make sure you're aware of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=4804)|
| 1:20:06| host compliance, I want to be clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=4806)|
| 1:20:08| Please share that with your constituents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=4808)|
| 1:20:10| but I also want to recognize if they call 311,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=4810)|
| 1:20:13| they will get directed to host compliance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=4813)|
| 1:20:15| and also they can contact you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=4815)|
| 1:20:17| I mean, we will investigate in terms of that request for documentation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=4817)|
| 1:20:21| based on a number of reports.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=4821)|
| 1:20:23| So, again, in terms of this is not the only pathway to provide,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=4823)|
| 1:20:28| especially the concern around residency,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=4828)|
| 1:20:30| which is one that we can follow up and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=4830)|
| 1:20:32| hey, it has come to our attention that you may not be living here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=4832)|
| 1:20:35| Can you please produce the documentation required| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=4835)|
| 1:20:37| that you are a resident of this property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=4837)|
| 1:20:40| Christina does that regularly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=4840)|
| 1:20:45| Council Member Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=4845)|
| 1:20:48| That's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=4848)|
| 1:20:49| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=4849)|
| 1:20:50| I'll keep thinking and working on my list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=4850)|
| 1:20:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=4851)|
| 1:20:52| I remembered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=4852)|
| 1:20:53| I told you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=4853)|
| 1:20:54| Thank you for speaking, Charlie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=4854)|
| 1:20:56| My question is the proof of residency are the five things that we list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=4856)|
| 1:21:04| The only things that we list, who picks those five?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=4864)|
| 1:21:09| Is that in state statute,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=4869)|
| 1:21:11| or was that in our ordinance that we could change?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=4871)|
| 1:21:15| They are in our ordinance as the documentation allowable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=4875)|
| 1:21:20| to prove residency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=4880)|
| 1:21:22| So they align oftentimes with the state and other cities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=4882)|
| 1:21:27| but that is defined by code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=4887)|
| 1:21:29| That's not defined by the tax office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=4889)|
| 1:21:31| But what I spoke to earlier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=4891)|
| 1:21:34| and I think what Councilman Thomas is talking about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=4894)|
| 1:21:37| is sometimes those documents don't mean much| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=4897)|
| 1:21:41| about whether you're actually living there or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=4901)|
| 1:21:45| You can get married, move in, still own your house,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=4905)|
| 1:21:50| say you're living there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=4910)|
| 1:21:52| still be able to produce all the documents that say you live there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=4912)|
| 1:21:55| and you're not living there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=4915)|
| 1:21:57| So I'm just reiterating what I know people are experiencing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=4917)|
| 1:22:03| I also feel strongly that whether it is burdensome for the city or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=4923)|
| 1:22:12| we owe it to constituents to have to make people prove every year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=4932)|
| 1:22:17| the occupancy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=4937)|
| 1:22:20| I think that's what people expect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=4940)|
| 1:22:22| And if you're getting a permit, you know, when I renew other things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=4942)|
| 1:22:27| I have to prove all over again that what I said the first time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=4947)|
| 1:22:30| is still true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=4950)|
| 1:22:32| Heck, I can't go to the doctor without verifying that I still live at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=4952)|
| 1:22:35| the house I live at and my insurance hasn't changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=4955)|
| 1:22:39| So I think that's the least we can do to help citizens feel like we,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=4959)|
| 1:22:44| as the city, are doing all the due diligence we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=4964)|
| 1:22:48| And so if it's not clear in the ordinance, that's what we required,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=4968)|
| 1:22:53| I would encourage, I'd like to work with you, Mr. Frost,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=4973)|
| 1:22:58| to make sure we make that language clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=4978)|
| 1:23:01| I'm not a lawyer, but I'm just, you know, either we need to have confidence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=4981)|
| 1:23:06| that the city's going to do that or we need to tighten up the language| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=4986)|
| 1:23:10| so there's no question that it's what we expect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=4990)|
| 1:23:14| I think knowing that we would have some legacy provisions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=4994)|
| 1:23:18| if you change the ordinance, we would rather try to work proactively.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=4998)|
| 1:23:21| Again, that's a practice that we can implement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=5001)|
| 1:23:23| and one that we have discussed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=5003)|
| 1:23:25| So again, I think I want to recognize that the documentation limits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=5005)|
| 1:23:28| are somewhat challenging and it's very hard to prove residency| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=5008)|
| 1:23:31| if not by paperwork.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=5011)|
| 1:23:34| So that is a harder challenge to solve, but in terms of our exploration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=5014)|
| 1:23:38| of saying, hey, let's look at that renewal process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=5018)|
| 1:23:41| and what is required to submit alongside your $50,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=5021)|
| 1:23:44| that's something that we've been open and willing to explore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=5024)|
| 1:23:47| And can we raise the fee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=5027)|
| 1:23:50| What would happen if we raised the fee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=5030)|
| 1:23:51| To renew.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=5031)|
| 1:23:54| You could raise the fee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=5034)|
| 1:23:55| Again, I don't know what the implications of the state law,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=5035)|
| 1:23:57| but that is an option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=5037)|
| 1:24:00| That's not really an ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=5040)|
| 1:24:02| That's a fee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=5042)|
| 1:24:03| Okay, so as far as fees, there's nothing in state law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=5043)|
| 1:24:05| that authorizes the city to charge a fee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=5045)|
| 1:24:07| And the way that's been interpreted for across all units,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=5047)|
| 1:24:10| not just short-term rental units,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=5050)|
| 1:24:12| is it needs to reflect the actual cost of regulating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=5052)|
| 1:24:16| or implementing the short-term rental.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=5056)|
| 1:24:18| So any fee that you charge would need to reflect the actual cost of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=5058)|
| 1:24:23| and I would encourage you to have documentation for it so it's not challenged.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=5063)|
| 1:24:26| Well, then I think that I would encourage us to find out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=5066)|
| 1:24:29| what it actually cost us to do what the ordinance says to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=5069)|
| 1:24:34| about an application and then create a fee that supports that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=5074)|
| 1:24:40| The state, for example, does limit what local governments can charge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=5080)|
| 1:24:44| for a beer permit application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=5084)|
| 1:24:47| I'm just posing the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=5087)|
| 1:24:49| I'm not going to violate the state law,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=5089)|
| 1:24:51| but what I'm hearing is we don't do what the ordinance says| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=5091)|
| 1:24:55| because it can be cost-prohibitive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=5095)|
| 1:25:00| Use of time might require more staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=5100)|
| 1:25:03| If it takes more staff to do what the ordinance says to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=5103)|
| 1:25:07| and we need to charge more money to cover that cost,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=5107)|
| 1:25:10| I'd like to at least explore that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=5110)|
| 1:25:12| That's all I'm saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=5112)|
| 1:25:16| Council Member Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=5116)|
| 1:25:19| Yeah, I found what I kept getting at that I wasn't asking about very clearly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=5119)|
| 1:25:24| On page 7 of the print packet for the presentation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=5124)|
| 1:25:34| the slide that says Short-Term Rental Unit Act Legacy Provisions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=5134)|
| 1:25:38| and then below it says the bottom paragraph,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=5138)|
| 1:25:42| may continue to operate until the property is sold, transferred,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=5142)|
| 1:25:47| ceases being used as a short-term rental unit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=5147)|
| 1:25:50| for a period of continuous months, so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=5150)|
| 1:25:53| Okay, so the list of Airbnbs on the city's website, short-term rentals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=5153)|
| 1:26:01| has in some instances names for ownership| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=5161)|
| 1:26:06| that don't match owner-operator permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=5166)|
| 1:26:11| Are you looking at Type 1 or Type 2?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=5171)|
| 1:26:13| Type 1, sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=5173)|
| 1:26:14| I'm not going to even concern myself with Type 2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=5174)|
| 1:26:17| Yeah, there are a number of those that we have reviewed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=5177)|
| 1:26:20| and in two particular instances where they do not appear to be natural persons,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=5180)|
| 1:26:23| we looked specifically into those instances,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=5183)|
| 1:26:25| but otherwise they actually do line up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=5185)|
| 1:26:27| No, there's one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=5187)|
| 1:26:28| They're my friends.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=5188)|
| 1:26:29| They moved to Washington State,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=5189)|
| 1:26:30| and I've actually been sitting here actively texting or asking her questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=5190)|
| 1:26:33| So now we're going to have to open an investigation on them, Lauren.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=5193)|
| 1:26:35| You don't have to open an investigation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=5195)|
| 1:26:37| I'll tell you their names and the people that own them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=5197)|
| 1:26:40| I'm friends with the current owners, friends with the past owners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=5200)|
| 1:26:43| Okay, so I guess my instance is, is there any way to look at that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=5203)|
| 1:26:48| So clearly you guys have generated a refreshed list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=5208)|
| 1:26:51| It has an October date on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=5211)|
| 1:26:53| Do you not have a way of saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=5213)|
| 1:26:55| if but then these two columns match of some sort,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=5215)|
| 1:26:58| or if but then there's a change that seems like an Excel spreadsheet possibility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=5218)|
| 1:27:02| that doesn't require a ton of manpower?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=5222)|
| 1:27:05| I guess it's not worth it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=5225)|
| 1:27:07| That one just flagged to me because it's a person who's talked to me a lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=5227)|
| 1:27:10| about short-term rentals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=5230)|
| 1:27:11| Did they sell their house?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=5231)|
| 1:27:12| Yes, they moved to Washington State.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=5232)|
| 1:27:14| They don't live here anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=5234)|
| 1:27:15| And are they the old permit holders?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=5235)|
| 1:27:17| No, and now the new owners are listed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=5237)|
| 1:27:19| So you have the operator permit name, because maybe her permit hasn't expired.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=5239)|
| 1:27:24| Can you say, I mean, I think we do when we notice those discrepancies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=5244)|
| 1:27:28| We want to dig further into them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=5248)|
| 1:27:30| And I'm just using them as an example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=5250)|
| 1:27:32| I don't care about that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=5252)|
| 1:27:33| I just was noticing discrepancies between the two columns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=5253)|
| 1:27:37| where the owner doesn't match the operator,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=5257)|
| 1:27:40| and that one is a newbie because they moved and they sold their property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=5260)|
| 1:27:45| And the current owners are not operating a short-term rental.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=5265)|
| 1:27:49| They had a discussion with me about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=5269)|
| 1:27:52| So I guess maybe one thing that might be helpful in clarifying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=5272)|
| 1:27:56| when that application for a permit is made, we do require the deed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=5276)|
| 1:28:01| and our tax office verifies that for each and every permit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=5281)|
| 1:28:04| that the deed matches the application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=5284)|
| 1:28:08| So that is done for Type 1 permits, and that, again, is the –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=5288)|
| 1:28:12| So for a Type 1 permit, I show you the deed that proves that I own the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=5292)|
| 1:28:17| It doesn't prove that I live there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=5297)|
| 1:28:20| It just proves I own it, just like the KUB bill just proves that I own it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=5300)|
| 1:28:24| You show us the deed that says you are the owner of the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=5304)|
| 1:28:28| for which you are applying for a permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=5308)|
| 1:28:30| I own several properties, but I can't operate all of them as Type 1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=5310)|
| 1:28:34| No, you may not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=5314)|
| 1:28:35| Right, because owning it is not the same as –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=5315)|
| 1:28:38| Owning is necessary but not sufficient.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=5318)|
| 1:28:41| You also have to establish residency,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=5321)|
| 1:28:43| and that's where we get into the documentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=5323)|
| 1:28:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=5325)|
| 1:28:47| Both. So you have to have both.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=5327)|
| 1:28:49| So you have to establish ownership with a deed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=5329)|
| 1:28:52| and then if you own the property, then we say, okay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=5332)|
| 1:28:55| well, then I prove you're actually living there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=5335)|
| 1:28:57| with these five pieces of documentation that our ordinance allows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=5337)|
| 1:29:01| Okay. I'm going to leave that one alone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=5341)|
| 1:29:03| I just thought it was interesting some of them had changed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=5343)|
| 1:29:05| and I didn't know what was being looked at because you're newly generating a list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=5345)|
| 1:29:09| I'm dropping that conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=5349)|
| 1:29:13| You said no permits have been revoked since the ordinance was passed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=5353)|
| 1:29:18| but have there been people who –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=5358)|
| 1:29:21| the government notices that people are operating Airbnbs that don't have permits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=5361)|
| 1:29:28| so how often are those people coming in and getting a permit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=5368)|
| 1:29:31| versus people are still operating an Airbnb without a permit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=5371)|
| 1:29:35| So we – I think I can answer your question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=5375)|
| 1:29:39| In most cases, people either stop operating as an Airbnb,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=5379)|
| 1:29:42| and we don't have the breakdown between what they do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=5382)|
| 1:29:46| but either they come into compliance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=5386)|
| 1:29:48| or they continue getting harassed from us by us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=5388)|
| 1:29:52| until they come into compliance or stop advertising| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=5392)|
| 1:29:54| and they stop listing their property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=5394)|
| 1:29:56| So if they continue – if they're posting on Airbnb| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=5396)|
| 1:29:58| and host compliance is flagging them as not having a permit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=5398)|
| 1:30:01| they're going to continue to receive letters,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=5401)|
| 1:30:03| and after that third letter, if they're still advertising,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=5403)|
| 1:30:06| we would issue a citation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=5406)|
| 1:30:07| We have never gotten to that point as of today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=5407)|
| 1:30:10| to actually have to issue that citation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=5410)|
| 1:30:12| because everyone has either stopped advertising,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=5412)|
| 1:30:15| made it a long-term rental, or come in and gotten a permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=5415)|
| 1:30:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=5419)|
| 1:30:22| Council Member McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=5422)|
| 1:30:24| My light is on for Council Member Singh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=5424)|
| 1:30:26| My light's not working.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=5426)|
| 1:30:28| Council Member Singh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=5428)|
| 1:30:30| That's interesting that no citations have been issued.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=5430)|
| 1:30:36| One thing I think before we widen for Type 1,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=5436)|
| 1:30:42| the variety of applicants as in renters,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=5442)|
| 1:30:45| I think we need to tighten up what we already have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=5445)|
| 1:30:47| and figure out how to enforce it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=5447)|
| 1:30:50| So the disconnect seems to be if I have a neighbor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=5450)|
| 1:30:55| and I continue to call the police department with complaints,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=5455)|
| 1:31:00| and I know that they're renting it out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=5460)|
| 1:31:03| and then the city cross-references the police department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=5463)|
| 1:31:07| if they have gotten one complaint| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=5467)|
| 1:31:09| or if Grenicus has gotten a complaint,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=5469)|
| 1:31:13| it could easily be dismissed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=5473)|
| 1:31:16| Well, we wouldn't know did the police go there for the owner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=5476)|
| 1:31:21| or for the short-term renter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=5481)|
| 1:31:24| So it could be a never-ending.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=5484)|
| 1:31:27| There could be 70 complaints.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=5487)|
| 1:31:29| So it seems like that's where we need to work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=5489)|
| 1:31:32| Yes, and that's why the host compliance in real time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=5492)|
| 1:31:35| is really important| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=5495)|
| 1:31:37| because it is specific to short-term rentals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=5497)|
| 1:31:39| and it allows that documentation of instances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=5499)|
| 1:31:42| I mean, again, if it's an emergency, call the police, bottom line,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=5502)|
| 1:31:45| if it's an emergency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=5505)|
| 1:31:46| But if it's just a framework of we don't think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=5506)|
| 1:31:50| that they're violating a minor infraction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=5510)|
| 1:31:53| trash, noise, parking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=5513)|
| 1:31:56| host compliance is a really good tool| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=5516)|
| 1:31:58| because, again, it's 24-7,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=5518)|
| 1:32:00| and that documents in real time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=5520)|
| 1:32:02| that this property was being used improperly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=5522)|
| 1:32:07| with the allegation that it's being used improperly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=5527)|
| 1:32:09| as a short-term rental.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=5529)|
| 1:32:10| Presumably you know kind of who your neighbors are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=5530)|
| 1:32:12| and you can tell if they're there, but not in all cases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=5532)|
| 1:32:14| So that is a really important step because of that real time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=5534)|
| 1:32:18| That creates the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=5538)|
| 1:32:20| And if it was also accompanied| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=5540)|
| 1:32:22| because it was a big infraction with a police report| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=5542)|
| 1:32:25| that the police were called,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=5545)|
| 1:32:27| then not only is there a real-time host compliance direct result| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=5547)|
| 1:32:32| for us to say we've got to investigate this further,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=5552)|
| 1:32:34| then when we do that investigation we're going to find,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=5554)|
| 1:32:37| ah, yes, and in fact a police report was made| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=5557)|
| 1:32:40| that can be evidence to create a violation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=5560)|
| 1:32:45| or a citation that would then count toward their three strikes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=5565)|
| 1:32:52| How are people supposed to know this hotline number| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=5572)|
| 1:32:54| or the real-time number?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=5574)|
| 1:32:56| I know through 311, but how much information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=5576)|
| 1:32:59| does the police department have when they get a call?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=5579)|
| 1:33:02| I know they can't know which location is being rented out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=5582)|
| 1:33:08| and which isn't, but are they, I don't know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=5588)|
| 1:33:12| how much information do they have?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=5592)|
| 1:33:14| I'm not sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=5594)|
| 1:33:15| I don't know if Chief Noel could provide some perspective| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=5595)|
| 1:33:18| maybe at a later date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=5598)|
| 1:33:20| Again, not working in law enforcement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=5600)|
| 1:33:23| I don't know how often when they respond to a call| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=5603)|
| 1:33:25| that the term short-term rental is even invoked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=5605)|
| 1:33:27| because they're presumably responding to something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=5607)|
| 1:33:29| that is an issue that they're not worried about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=5609)|
| 1:33:33| whether it's being used as an SDR at the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=5613)|
| 1:33:36| If I call and say my neighbor, which it's a short-term rental,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=5616)|
| 1:33:41| and there are noise problems there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=5621)|
| 1:33:43| I'm just wondering if the police would know, like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=5623)|
| 1:33:45| okay, this is a different situation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=5625)|
| 1:33:48| and here's the number you need to call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=5628)|
| 1:33:50| I don't know the answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=5630)|
| 1:33:51| I would say that RFAQs, I believe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=5631)|
| 1:33:53| still suggest that if you're calling either 311 or 911,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=5633)|
| 1:33:58| if it is a short-term rental and you want to make a note of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=5638)|
| 1:34:01| I mean, as a caller,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=5641)|
| 1:34:03| because that does create a little bit more of a paper trail for us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=5643)|
| 1:34:05| when we're doing an investigation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=5645)|
| 1:34:08| And then what concerns me is about revoking permits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=5648)|
| 1:34:11| It says the burden of proof is on the city to prove the violations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=5651)|
| 1:34:15| What kind of proof would that be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=5655)|
| 1:34:17| if a neighbor is calling in on somebody else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=5657)|
| 1:34:25| In that type of situation, we would, you know, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=5665)|
| 1:34:28| depending on what the nature of the complaint is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=5668)|
| 1:34:30| we would talk with other relevant departments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=5670)|
| 1:34:33| So, for instance, if we're talking about some kind of a trash issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=5673)|
| 1:34:36| we might talk to our city code's office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=5676)|
| 1:34:38| and see if there was, you know, any kind of an issue there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=5678)|
| 1:34:41| Of course, if neighbors have any kind of photo evidence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=5681)|
| 1:34:44| or anything like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=5684)|
| 1:34:45| we take that into consideration as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=5685)|
| 1:34:47| Ms. Gill mentioned police reports and things along those lines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=5687)|
| 1:34:51| If there's some kind of, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=5691)|
| 1:34:52| an emergency issue that needs to be responded to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=5692)|
| 1:34:55| that's something that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=5695)|
| 1:34:57| of course we could pull in that police officer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=5697)|
| 1:34:59| if for some reason, you know, they knocked on the door| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=5699)|
| 1:35:02| and the people said, oh, we're just renting for the weekend| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=5702)|
| 1:35:05| or something along those lines, that officer could testify to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=5705)|
| 1:35:09| How could I prove that the residence was not owner-occupied?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=5709)|
| 1:35:18| If I know that to be true, because I see it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=5718)|
| 1:35:22| but where is proof of that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=5722)|
| 1:35:25| If they can still bring in the documentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=5725)|
| 1:35:29| Yeah, so, and to kind of clarify one of the statements I made earlier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=5729)|
| 1:35:33| residency under our code, of course,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=5733)|
| 1:35:35| is established with those documents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=5735)|
| 1:35:37| the W-2, the school registration, the DMV registration, things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=5737)|
| 1:35:43| Whenever we get any kind of a complaint along those lines,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=5743)|
| 1:35:45| that somebody is saying my neighbor really doesn't live there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=5745)|
| 1:35:48| and I know they're operating it as a short-term rental,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=5748)|
| 1:35:51| we check the application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=5751)|
| 1:35:53| We made sure that they qualified at whatever time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=5753)|
| 1:35:55| that they came in and got the permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=5755)|
| 1:35:57| We reach out to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=5757)|
| 1:35:58| We provide that email and then the follow-up notice via mail| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=5758)|
| 1:36:01| and we say you have 30 days to present evidence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=5761)|
| 1:36:05| My practice has been to say you provided us, for instance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=5765)|
| 1:36:11| W-2 and a driver's license when you applied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=5771)|
| 1:36:14| Send me something else from that same list of documents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=5774)|
| 1:36:17| so a voter ID card, school registration, whatever that is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=5777)|
| 1:36:21| I, to date, have not had anybody push back on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=5781)|
| 1:36:25| And in addition to that, that's where I mentioned the utility bill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=5785)|
| 1:36:29| They will send me additional things that also corroborate the fact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=5789)|
| 1:36:34| that they can establish residency with the paper trail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=5794)|
| 1:36:38| Another example might be a bank account statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=5798)|
| 1:36:40| That's not an exhaustive list,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=5800)|
| 1:36:42| and certainly we would not just take a utility bill| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=5802)|
| 1:36:45| and say this proves your residency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=5805)|
| 1:36:48| Certainly that would not be the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=5808)|
| 1:36:49| Of course, you know, we would go with the W-2, the school registration,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=5809)|
| 1:36:54| the documents in that list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=5814)|
| 1:36:56| It is extremely hard to prove,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=5816)|
| 1:36:58| but we do reach back out and verify upon every complaint along those lines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=5818)|
| 1:37:04| And are the complaints, there were just two this year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=5824)|
| 1:37:09| We've had two into the hotline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=5829)|
| 1:37:10| Again, Christina can speak to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=5830)|
| 1:37:13| Yeah, I believe that the two that we received,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=5833)|
| 1:37:19| I can't remember exactly what the topics were.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=5839)|
| 1:37:21| I'd be happy to pull that for counsel at a later date,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=5841)|
| 1:37:24| but both of them have been resolved since.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=5844)|
| 1:37:27| Did we know how many complaints have been called into 311?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=5847)|
| 1:37:30| There have been no additional complaints to 311.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=5850)|
| 1:37:33| We did scan the 311 records to make sure that they hadn't documented| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=5853)|
| 1:37:36| a short-term rental beyond what was reported to host compliance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=5856)|
| 1:37:41| and they had not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=5861)|
| 1:37:42| How about the complaints we get via e-mail?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=5862)|
| 1:37:44| Can we send them on to you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=5864)|
| 1:37:46| You can send them on to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=5866)|
| 1:37:47| I mean, truly, you send them on to us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=5867)|
| 1:37:49| and they will be treated as a case file that then begins an investigation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=5869)|
| 1:37:52| Council Member Singh, I've got other questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=5872)|
| 1:37:54| I can come back to you then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=5874)|
| 1:37:56| Council Member Testerman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=5876)|
| 1:37:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=5879)|
| 1:38:02| Let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=5882)|
| 1:38:06| Are you investigating just when you get a tip,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=5886)|
| 1:38:10| or do we actually have somebody who is dedicated to scouring?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=5890)|
| 1:38:20| A jillion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=5900)|
| 1:38:23| I didn't think it was on for a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=5903)|
| 1:38:25| There are a ton of platforms where people could be advertising, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=5905)|
| 1:38:31| a room, a house, or whatever the case may be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=5911)|
| 1:38:34| So I'm just curious, you know, sort of how diligent we are as far as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=5914)|
| 1:38:39| identifying people operating without permits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=5919)|
| 1:38:44| So we rely on host compliance to do that scanning of the major platforms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=5924)|
| 1:38:48| We do not employ staff to scan Craigslist or Facebook searching for other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=5928)|
| 1:38:56| additional errant postings that might violate the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=5936)|
| 1:39:00| Are they, in fact, doing that extensive of cross-checking?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=5940)|
| 1:39:06| Can someone host compliance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=5946)|
| 1:39:07| They're pretty comprehensive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=5947)|
| 1:39:08| I mean, this is a service that they provide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=5948)|
| 1:39:10| I mean, again, I think there's always ways of finding little ways of advertising.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=5950)|
| 1:39:15| Did they include Facebook Marketplace?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=5955)|
| 1:39:18| We're not sure about Craigslist or Facebook.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=5958)|
| 1:39:20| But, again, the main platforms, Airbnb, VRBO, HomeAway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=5960)|
| 1:39:24| there's probably some others that have popped up recently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=5964)|
| 1:39:26| But they're going after the big ones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=5966)|
| 1:39:32| I think you're muted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=5972)|
| 1:39:33| Check the button.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=5973)|
| 1:39:35| Can you hear me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=5975)|
| 1:39:40| Yeah, I mean, I just, like I said, I mean, I can go through Craigslist,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=5980)|
| 1:39:43| and there are a number of them now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=5983)|
| 1:39:45| So I was just curious how extensive that was because there are so many different platforms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=5985)|
| 1:39:54| As well, hypothetically, if, you know, citations were being issued,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=5994)|
| 1:40:00| I'm just curious, you know, it's $50 a day per day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=6000)|
| 1:40:06| And would that be, let's just say somebody is renting for all the home football games,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=6006)|
| 1:40:15| and they're not, you know, they're not in compliance, $50 citation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=6015)|
| 1:40:19| is it for the length of the rental or is it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=6019)|
| 1:40:24| It would be $50 per day until we can find verification that they're not advertising anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=6024)|
| 1:40:30| So they would need to pull it from the advertising platform.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=6030)|
| 1:40:34| Until they do, we would be able to charge them $50 a day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=6034)|
| 1:40:38| And then is that how that works?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=6038)|
| 1:40:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=6041)|
| 1:40:42| So then my question is, I mean, let's say they've accumulated 30 days' worth of citations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=6042)|
| 1:40:47| I mean, what are we, are we issuing a warrant after that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=6047)|
| 1:40:53| I mean, how are we then, you know, A, they're collecting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=6053)|
| 1:40:56| or B, ensuring they aren't going to a different platform or going through a different avenue?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=6056)|
| 1:41:01| As far as collecting, what would happen is they would receive a citation to municipal court,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=6061)|
| 1:41:06| and there would be a hearing set in front of the city judge at that point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=6066)|
| 1:41:09| and he would determine what fees to assess at that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=6069)|
| 1:41:21| Council Member Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=6081)|
| 1:41:27| My question I had is about the legacy provision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=6087)|
| 1:41:33| because it does seem like if we do not have any grandfathered properties in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=6093)|
| 1:41:37| then that is not applicable to our current ordinance or changes to our ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=6097)|
| 1:41:45| Is there something I'm missing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=6105)|
| 1:41:48| So the state law provides that the law, in effect,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=6108)|
| 1:41:51| at the time that the unit was being held out for as a short-term rental| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=6111)|
| 1:41:55| is the law that will regulate that unit for as long as it is continued to be in operation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=6115)|
| 1:42:02| So if you amend this ordinance or create a new ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=6122)|
| 1:42:07| it would create a legacy group of anybody who meets the definition of legacy at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=6127)|
| 1:42:16| Gotcha. I'll have to read that more closely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=6136)|
| 1:42:18| I did not read it that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=6138)|
| 1:42:22| So another question in terms of enforcement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=6142)|
| 1:42:26| one piece of our ordinance that seems like it would be a good section to ensure compliance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=6146)|
| 1:42:37| is that there's a local contact person required who must be able to respond within 45 minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=6157)|
| 1:42:46| I kind of have two questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=6166)|
| 1:42:48| One is, you know, I imagine this not having such person would be a violation of our ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=6168)|
| 1:43:02| that would warrant a citation, and we've had no citations issued.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=6182)|
| 1:43:07| Have we had any way to test whether permit holders are maintaining a local contact person| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=6187)|
| 1:43:14| who can be contacted and, you know, report within 45 minutes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=6194)|
| 1:43:20| Yes. To give an example, we did receive a complaint about a short-term rental unit owner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=6200)|
| 1:43:27| and the guests that were staying there had a loud party there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=6207)|
| 1:43:34| We did investigate the complaint, and actually on Airbnb,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=6214)|
| 1:43:39| there was a review posted by the guest who stayed there that weekend| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=6219)|
| 1:43:44| and was responsible for the loud party.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=6224)|
| 1:43:46| She actually rated the owner very low in terms of the stars or whatever it was for the Airbnb| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=6226)|
| 1:43:53| and went into great detail about how somebody came out and told her to wrap up the party| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=6233)|
| 1:44:00| or they needed to go within 30 minutes, you know, things along those lines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=6240)|
| 1:44:04| So with that example in mind, yes, that has been a concrete one that I have noticed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=6244)|
| 1:44:10| Let me jump in real quick, Mr. Johnson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=6250)|
| 1:44:12| Pause the clock, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=6252)|
| 1:44:14| Someone in the audience appears to be listening to something that's audible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=6254)|
| 1:44:18| and it's distracting for the members up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=6258)|
| 1:44:23| Can you all hear that feedback?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=6263)|
| 1:44:28| Is it outside?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=6268)|
| 1:44:30| It's coming from that way to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=6270)|
| 1:44:32| Is it up there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=6272)|
| 1:44:34| Like in the CCD box?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=6274)|
| 1:44:39| Does that sound like it's a seed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=6279)|
| 1:44:41| I think, yeah, I think it may be coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=6281)|
| 1:44:44| Is there a way to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=6284)|
| 1:44:49| It's very distracting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=6289)|
| 1:44:51| Let's take a five-minute break so that we can resolve the sound issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=6291)|
| 1:44:59| All right, I'll bring us back from our recess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=6299)|
| 1:45:02| I think we've solved the sound issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=6302)|
| 1:45:04| I hope we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=6304)|
| 1:45:06| Council Member Parker, I'm sorry we interrupted you to try to address that sound,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=6306)|
| 1:45:11| but we've got your timer paused and we'll resume with you when you start.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=6311)|
| 1:45:16| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=6316)|
| 1:45:26| I mean, we were talking about the impact of state law on our ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=6326)|
| 1:45:34| and the legacy provisions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=6334)|
| 1:45:36| and I do think that we need to look into that a little further| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=6336)|
| 1:45:39| because I'm reading it differently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=6339)|
| 1:45:42| and I'm hearing from others who are reading it differently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=6342)|
| 1:45:45| So it would be good for us to come to some sort of agreement on how that controls,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=6345)|
| 1:45:51| especially if it's going to limit our ability to, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=6351)|
| 1:45:57| learn as this newer ordinance is implemented and make changes as needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=6357)|
| 1:46:04| That's concerning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=6364)|
| 1:46:05| So that's just one thing that I wanted to make a priority or suggest be a priority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=6365)|
| 1:46:14| And the last, I kind of, no, I'm not going to ask that question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=6374)|
| 1:46:19| I'm in agreement with some of my colleagues that I do think we need to explore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=6379)|
| 1:46:26| Sorry, I'm not as close as I was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=6386)|
| 1:46:28| I do agree with some of my colleagues that I do think we need to explore some changes to the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=6388)|
| 1:46:35| And so having a clear understanding of how state law will impact our ability to enforce an ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=6395)|
| 1:46:47| whether it will create these three separate categories of enforcement, I think is important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=6407)|
| 1:46:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=6413)|
| 1:46:55| Council Member Reier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=6415)|
| 1:46:57| Yeah, I just wanted to briefly comment on some things that were said earlier| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=6417)|
| 1:47:02| about the differentiation in renters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=6422)|
| 1:47:07| I don't know how to make this sound correct,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=6427)|
| 1:47:09| but the renters being allowed to have Type 1 permits or being able, yeah,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=6429)|
| 1:47:15| being able to have permits in Type 1 in residential area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=6435)|
| 1:47:19| and comparing that to the fact that renters can pull a permit in a Type 2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=6439)|
| 1:47:25| That's correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=6445)|
| 1:47:27| So the difference is commercial zone versus residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=6447)|
| 1:47:31| And what I heard was if renters can do it in a commercial zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=6451)|
| 1:47:35| they should also be able to have that benefit in a residential zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=6455)|
| 1:47:39| And those two zones are vastly different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=6459)|
| 1:47:41| People make a choice to live in an area that's commercial in nature,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=6461)|
| 1:47:45| has hotels, and has a lot of mixed use in it, or more commercial area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=6465)|
| 1:47:53| I don't support them having the ability to have inherently the same rights in a residential area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=6473)|
| 1:47:59| and treat it the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=6479)|
| 1:48:01| They're inherently different zones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=6481)|
| 1:48:03| So that's one reason that I wouldn't support that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=6483)|
| 1:48:06| As a landlord, I have leases that say you can't sublet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=6486)|
| 1:48:11| So even if you change the ordinance to say that my tenants could,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=6491)|
| 1:48:15| so that's a totally separate issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=6495)|
| 1:48:17| I just wanted to clarify that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=6497)|
| 1:48:19| They would be violating the lease that I have with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=6499)|
| 1:48:23| I also charge below market rates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=6503)|
| 1:48:26| So maybe if I wanted to allow them the permission to be able to rent things out and sublet them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=6506)|
| 1:48:31| I would change my rental rates to reflect that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=6511)|
| 1:48:34| But that's a wholly different issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=6514)|
| 1:48:36| I just want to, my whole point was to starkly contrast commercial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=6516)|
| 1:48:41| and that this is a commercial use, and that's people's complaint with it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=6521)|
| 1:48:46| and that's people's dog-legging enforcement is that it is a commercial use in a residential area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=6526)|
| 1:48:54| And it's one thing for you to rent your home out for football weekends or special events.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=6534)|
| 1:49:02| If you look at Airbnb for Augusta, Georgia, and the facilities around there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=6542)|
| 1:49:07| you can rent a home there for a large sum of money early in spring for a golf tournament,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=6547)|
| 1:49:12| and that's about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=6552)|
| 1:49:13| Everyone rents their home out for a special event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=6553)|
| 1:49:17| Probably the same thing in Indianapolis when there's the raceway event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=6557)|
| 1:49:23| So those are one-offs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=6563)|
| 1:49:26| That's different than wholly operating a hotel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=6566)|
| 1:49:30| So I just wanted to ramble on about the very stark differences between commercial and residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=6570)|
| 1:49:39| Council Member McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=6579)|
| 1:49:41| Thank you, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=6581)|
| 1:49:43| Do we know how many calls potentially have gone into codes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=6583)|
| 1:49:47| Is there a way to cross-reference those?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=6587)|
| 1:49:49| I think the answer is probably no because it sounds like if they're not coming through those channels| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=6589)|
| 1:49:54| that you guys described, it's very hard to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=6594)|
| 1:49:57| Is that a true statement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=6597)|
| 1:49:59| I don't know the answer to the number of calls, but, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=6599)|
| 1:50:01| if there's a complaint that is landing on our desk somehow as relating to a short-term rental,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=6601)|
| 1:50:08| then the code record would be one of those additional places we would go to investigate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=6608)|
| 1:50:12| to verify that complaint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=6612)|
| 1:50:15| And it's only when it comes to you guys through those direct channels that you put out there on the website?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=6615)|
| 1:50:21| Any of the direct channels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=6621)|
| 1:50:22| And, again, I want to emphasize if you, Council Member McKenzie,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=6622)|
| 1:50:25| had gotten an email from a constituent and you forwarded that to us that said there was a code violation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=6625)|
| 1:50:30| we would then go and look for whether we had a record of that code violation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=6630)|
| 1:50:34| So it doesn't have to be through the hotline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=6634)|
| 1:50:36| It could be through any number of channels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=6636)|
| 1:50:38| But, yes, if we have a reason to think that there might have been something amiss,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=6638)|
| 1:50:42| we would explore any number of those databases that we have access to to try to verify that complaint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=6642)|
| 1:50:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=6649)|
| 1:50:50| And so, you know, this was actually a very hot topic when we ran for office in 2017.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=6650)|
| 1:50:58| Highly contentious, if I recall correctly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=6658)|
| 1:51:02| And so I would be interested in, and I know when you guys started the presentation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=6662)|
| 1:51:07| you said that there were some changes that were made and you just kind of wanted to start from here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=6667)|
| 1:51:12| But it may be good for us to see what changes were made from the inception versus today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=6672)|
| 1:51:19| Just for a point of clarity, I and I'm sure the rest of my colleagues received several emails from neighborhood groups| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=6679)|
| 1:51:28| and people who live in communities who say that they have called and complained,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=6688)|
| 1:51:32| but it sounds like some of those calls may have gone to 911.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=6692)|
| 1:51:35| Don't know how they were categorized, those types of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=6695)|
| 1:51:38| But I'll forward those because they do specifically give an address that I think that would definitely warrant some investigation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=6698)|
| 1:51:45| And that one was in Sequoia Hills area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=6705)|
| 1:51:47| It looks like it may have been investigated a couple of times, but that one specifically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=6707)|
| 1:51:52| And then we'll forward the other ones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=6712)|
| 1:51:54| I do think that we need to continue to look at this and have more dialogue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=6714)|
| 1:51:57| because it just sounds like we can tighten it up to some degree to have some better governance over how you guys get complaints.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=6717)|
| 1:52:08| So when you send a letter, if someone in my community gets a permit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=6728)|
| 1:52:14| do you send me a letter as a neighbor in that residence to let me know that now this address has gotten a permit for a short-term rental?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=6734)|
| 1:52:24| The permit applicant would be required to send or notify,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=6744)|
| 1:52:29| and again, Ms. Hugett alluded to this, receive a letter to the surrounding properties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=6749)|
| 1:52:34| as well as notify the neighborhood association if one exists.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=6754)|
| 1:52:38| So they would notify the neighborhood association and the neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=6758)|
| 1:52:42| So I would be notified by my neighbor who has a permit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=6762)|
| 1:52:45| The adjacent neighbors, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=6765)|
| 1:52:52| And there's a map in the app, you know, because some people are, like, across the street, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=6772)|
| 1:52:56| So there's a map that shows the immediate surrounding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=6776)|
| 1:52:59| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=6779)|
| 1:53:01| Council Member Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=6781)|
| 1:53:03| Thank you, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=6783)|
| 1:53:04| I'll make two more rental comments because I think this is important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=6784)|
| 1:53:09| The current code says that a signature of the owner acknowledging the owner's understanding of a city short-term rental unit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=6789)|
| 1:53:16| rules and verifies the owner's agreement they are legally responsible for liable compliance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=6796)|
| 1:53:20| In other words, whether it's commercial or residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=6800)|
| 1:53:23| the owner of the property has to allow for a renter to apply for this permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=6803)|
| 1:53:29| So there's no legal liability on any commercial owner or residential owner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=6809)|
| 1:53:33| whether there's one house, 10 houses, 20 houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=6813)|
| 1:53:36| Second, there are, I'm looking at multiple properties, multiple situations now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=6816)|
| 1:53:41| where there's a permit one and a permit two a block away from each other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=6821)|
| 1:53:45| And so the idea that a renter of a residential home can't do that when there's no liability on the owner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=6825)|
| 1:53:50| but the commercial one street over, we're essentially, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=6830)|
| 1:53:55| unintentionally discriminating against residential renters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=6835)|
| 1:53:58| And I just don't think that that's fair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=6838)|
| 1:54:00| And I think that if you own an expensive property on a commercial street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=6840)|
| 1:54:05| or own a regular home that's R and 1 around the corner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=6845)|
| 1:54:11| there's no reason a renter shouldn't be able to do that while they're away traveling for work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=6851)|
| 1:54:16| or serving in the military or something else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=6856)|
| 1:54:21| I just don't think that that's fair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=6861)|
| 1:54:23| And I think if we're concerned about regulations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=6863)|
| 1:54:26| it should be applied to residential and commercial owners alike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=6866)|
| 1:54:30| And if we're not doing a good job, we're not doing a good job for one and vice versa.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=6870)|
| 1:54:34| So I think people should be able to maximize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=6874)|
| 1:54:39| I think the research is out is not out yet on whether this provides more affordable housing or adds to the housing stock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=6879)|
| 1:54:45| I don't think that's what this is kind of for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=6885)|
| 1:54:48| I think this is for people to maximize their home value, whether they rent it or own it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=6888)|
| 1:54:57| And I have to remind everybody about how hard it is to pay for things now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=6897)|
| 1:55:02| And this is not a momentary thing. I think this should have been included to begin with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=6902)|
| 1:55:06| I don't think residential renters are any different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=6906)|
| 1:55:09| And in terms of the use, the functional use is the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=6909)|
| 1:55:13| You're sleeping. You're allowing someone to sleep in your home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=6913)|
| 1:55:17| And so whether that's a commercial room or a bedroom, you're renting it out to someone to sleep there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=6917)|
| 1:55:24| and the practical use is the exact same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=6924)|
| 1:55:27| So I would encourage everybody to think about that a little bit more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=6927)|
| 1:55:32| because I just have a number of people who are having a hard time getting by.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=6932)|
| 1:55:36| And if they have a reasonable and agreeable owner who wants to take that risk, they should be allowed to do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=6936)|
| 1:55:43| That's my final two cents on renters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=6943)|
| 1:55:47| Council Member Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=6947)|
| 1:55:51| Just one. I have a couple of questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=6951)|
| 1:55:55| One that I meant to ask earlier in terms of applications for new permits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=6955)|
| 1:56:06| Through that process, is there a check to determine whether that applicant has previously applied and obtained a permit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=6966)|
| 1:56:23| No, we don't cross-reference if they've been a former permit holder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=6983)|
| 1:56:28| Or if they're applying for their third permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=6988)|
| 1:56:32| We do make sure that they are not exceeding the limit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=6992)|
| 1:56:36| So if it's a Type 2 permit and they were allowed two, they would not be approved for a third permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=6996)|
| 1:56:42| And similarly, if they were already a Type 1 holder, they would not be approved for a second permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=7002)|
| 1:56:46| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=7006)|
| 1:56:49| I do think that we, just to follow up on what Council Member Smith was stating,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=7009)|
| 1:56:55| I do think we have to have some regulations in place to prevent investment companies from buying large numbers of housing stock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=7015)|
| 1:57:06| But I would agree that I'm not necessarily convinced that keeping renters from a Type 1 permit is helpful to our affordable housing stock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=7026)|
| 1:57:21| Because that's a long-term renter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=7041)|
| 1:57:25| So I just wanted to add that. And I wanted to ask if the presentation could be posted to the short-term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=7045)|
| 1:57:32| Yes, we have a short-term rental website and it will be added there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=7052)|
| 1:57:35| And then whatever additional record Mr. Johnson might keep, those slides will be public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=7055)|
| 1:57:40| Wonderful. That's all I have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=7060)|
| 1:57:42| Council Member Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=7062)|
| 1:57:44| Yes, we've talked about different complexities, verification process, the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=7064)|
| 1:57:49| Just a basic question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=7069)|
| 1:57:51| How much of the problems we've discussed do you think would be alleviated just by more staff?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=7071)|
| 1:58:01| How much of it is due to a shortage of staff?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=7081)|
| 1:58:04| Is it a lot of the problem just that you don't have the staff to enforce this properly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=7084)|
| 1:58:10| I'm just looking for kind of the balance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=7090)|
| 1:58:13| So this is an opinion, and I'll offer a chance for my colleagues to offer their own opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=7093)|
| 1:58:18| As has been articulated, and we don't disagree,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=7098)|
| 1:58:21| the biggest crux is this proof of residency versus do you actually sleep in the bed at night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=7101)|
| 1:58:30| And documentation, which we don't feel is out of whack with best practice,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=7110)|
| 1:58:36| is insufficient to be able to answer the question of does someone actually sleep in a bed at night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=7116)|
| 1:58:43| So more staff is probably not going to get us over that hurdle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=7123)|
| 1:58:49| We might catch a few more bad actors who are giving us false documents, fabricated documents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=7129)|
| 1:58:55| They're just flat out lying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=7135)|
| 1:58:57| We might have an ability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=7137)|
| 1:58:59| I think we could, again, even with some existing tools, Pond Renewal, for example, as we've discussed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=7139)|
| 1:59:04| find some of those, but this question of do I actually sleep in a bed at night,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=7144)|
| 1:59:09| I'm not even sure we legally could do it if we had someone set outside their house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=7149)|
| 1:59:13| I mean, again, there's these questions like how do you prove that someone is actually sleeping in their house at night?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=7153)|
| 1:59:17| And I'm not sure that more staff would be able to address that issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=7157)|
| 1:59:22| Okay. Thanks for the clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=7162)|
| 1:59:24| Would anyone else like to chime in on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=7164)|
| 1:59:28| That was very important for me to kind of get some clarification on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=7168)|
| 1:59:33| Thank you very much for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=7173)|
| 1:59:37| Following up on that, the affidavits, what affidavits are required for when you do an application?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=7177)|
| 1:59:47| So you have a packet in front of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=7187)|
| 1:59:49| I'll flip through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=7189)|
| 1:59:51| So there are, you know, there's an extensive, sorry, I'll try to speak very closely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=7191)|
| 1:59:55| The mic keeps moving on me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=7195)|
| 1:59:58| There's a life safety compliance affidavit that kind of stands alone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=7198)|
| 2:00:01| And the larger piece of this, though, is on page four,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=7201)|
| 2:00:07| and it is that clear acknowledgment that you are providing factual information and that you're not lying to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=7207)|
| 2:00:17| Christina, would you like, is there any, I mean, those are the two biggest pieces,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=7217)|
| 2:00:21| and they are encompassing that one in particular on that fourth page.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=7221)|
| 2:00:25| That is the, that's kind of the meat of the matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=7225)|
| 2:00:28| This is the fourth page.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=7228)|
| 2:00:30| You'll see in the very last full paragraph acknowledge that this affidavit is a governmental record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=7230)|
| 2:00:37| That is an affidavit that is a signature page for the entire application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=7237)|
| 2:00:42| And you also do see a reference to the Tennessee Code annotated regarding providing false information to a governmental entity as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=7242)|
| 2:00:51| Okay, so this, if I'm looking at the right one here, my page four, it says life safety compliance verification form at the top.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=7251)|
| 2:01:01| Is that the right page?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=7261)|
| 2:01:03| That was not the one I was referencing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=7263)|
| 2:01:05| The one that I was referencing is short-term rental unit permit operator application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=7265)|
| 2:01:14| It's a very long paragraph.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=7274)|
| 2:01:15| I acknowledge that I have read and will follow and comply with all short-term rental unit regulations and ordinances and so on and so on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=7275)|
| 2:01:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=7281)|
| 2:01:22| And so that would include the neighborhood notification, the, if you're a type one, that you're the primary resident?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=7282)|
| 2:01:29| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=7289)|
| 2:01:30| All of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=7290)|
| 2:01:31| So my question then is, if after this application has been turned in, you're made aware of information that was not correct in this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=7291)|
| 2:01:44| what is saying that it's, I guess, it doesn't say it's a sworn affidavit, but it's saying that you're affirming that you're going to tell the truth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=7304)|
| 2:01:54| What is the consequence if there's something in the application that this is signed that is not true and you find it's not true?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=7314)|
| 2:02:03| At that point, we would reach out, of course, to figure out whether there was any missing documentation as far as,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=7323)|
| 2:02:17| not missing as in the city did not request and receive that information,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=7337)|
| 2:02:21| but if there was any additional documentation or proof that needed to be provided.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=7341)|
| 2:02:25| But assuming we still were able to answer that question and say this person is not eligible to have this permit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=7345)|
| 2:02:33| we would at that point convene our group and we would determine whether we should issue a citation in that moment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=7353)|
| 2:02:41| or whether we could convince the owner to stop operating the short-term rental units or to stop advertising,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=7361)|
| 2:02:49| whatever that compliance might look like, but it could include a citation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=7369)|
| 2:02:53| So there would be consequences for not being truthful in the form that you filled out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=7373)|
| 2:02:59| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=7379)|
| 2:03:04| We talked a lot about applications and the types, but have any applications actually been turned down when the applications were made?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=7384)|
| 2:03:20| Sure. We often have people come into the office to try to pull a permit and we realize it's in a residential zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=7400)|
| 2:03:28| and they are not the owner or can't provide those documents and we say you can't have that permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=7408)|
| 2:03:35| So there's some number of them. They're not all just approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=7415)|
| 2:03:39| There's some number of them. You might come in and say, hey, I own this property. I don't live there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=7419)|
| 2:03:44| So you're not getting a title.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=7424)|
| 2:03:46| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=7426)|
| 2:03:51| How are you verifying the requirement that permit numbers are clearly displayed on advertising?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=7431)|
| 2:04:02| We really are not. There is a difficulty in doing that, in checking all those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=7442)|
| 2:04:09| It's a kind of a cart before the horse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=7449)|
| 2:04:12| They don't advertise prior to having the permit or they would be out of, and that's our interaction with him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=7452)|
| 2:04:20| So there is not a requirement that I am aware of that they have to then provide us a copy of their listing that shows that they have that permit number on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=7460)|
| 2:04:32| They are told and affirmed that they are going to follow those when they apply on that application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=7472)|
| 2:04:39| Well, and we just talked about that they're signing a document that says we're going to obey all the rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=7479)|
| 2:04:44| That's section 16-652 if they're supposed to display it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=7484)|
| 2:04:49| If someone makes you aware of this, would that not trigger some kind of action?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=7489)|
| 2:04:56| Then we would investigate and we would ask them to comply.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=7496)|
| 2:05:00| So, again, I mean, Christina can talk to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=7500)|
| 2:05:04| I don't know if this has come up as an actual example, but, yes, I mean, if we saw that, hey, you're not advertising it, you need to remember the rule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=7504)|
| 2:05:10| You will agree to this, and if they fail to then update their listing and post the permit number, then we would be able to take action hypothetically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=7510)|
| 2:05:18| That's the correct approach, but, no, we have not had that happen to date in terms of a complaint being received about it and opening an investigation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=7518)|
| 2:05:26| Okay, and the same thing would be for the neighborhood notification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=7526)|
| 2:05:31| If you remain aware that the neighborhood notification clause wasn't – I mean, that's supposed to happen, if I remember, within 48 hours of applying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=7531)|
| 2:05:43| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=7543)|
| 2:05:44| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=7544)|
| 2:05:45| So if – I would imagine it's going to be very difficult for anyone to advise you within 48 hours of the application because they probably don't know what it's been applied for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=7545)|
| 2:05:56| But after that 48 hours, if you hear from the neighborhood organization or the neighbors adjacent and they say, we never got any notice, what would the consequence be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=7556)|
| 2:06:07| So, again, I mean, I think what you're maybe cueing in on is our intention is not to be draconian and punitive when we hear those types of feedback.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=7567)|
| 2:06:16| So people move, neighbors change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=7576)|
| 2:06:18| Maybe it was a renter who lived next door and there's now a new renter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=7578)|
| 2:06:21| So we require that at the time of the application that that outreach is made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=7581)|
| 2:06:25| If we hear from a neighbor who says, I didn't know it was operating a resort for rental.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=7585)|
| 2:06:29| I don't know who to call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=7589)|
| 2:06:30| Who is the operator?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=7590)|
| 2:06:31| And this is a situation that has come up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=7591)|
| 2:06:33| Again, complaint received.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=7593)|
| 2:06:35| Investigation opened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=7595)|
| 2:06:36| We reach out to the operator or owner, depending on where it is, and notification is then given.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=7596)|
| 2:06:41| So, again, our role, our goal is not to beat people with a stick if they, for whatever reason, have a neighbor who has accused them of not complying with the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=7601)|
| 2:06:52| It is to say, how do we fix this problem?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=7612)|
| 2:06:54| How do we remedy the issue?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=7614)|
| 2:06:55| How do we address the concern?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=7615)|
| 2:06:57| And in a case like that, the concern can be addressed by having, hey, operator, you need to go to your neighbor at 605 Cherry Street to give them the information that you provided when you submitted the application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=7617)|
| 2:07:08| So I think I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=7628)|
| 2:07:10| So if that was brought to your attention, then you would ask, you didn't comply with this, you need to send out the letters and talk to the neighbor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=7630)|
| 2:07:18| Yeah, and again, I think the exercise that we would go through is less about can you show us proof that you notified them a year ago, eight months ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=7638)|
| 2:07:26| That's not the productive exercise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=7646)|
| 2:07:28| It's really about make sure that they know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=7648)|
| 2:07:30| You've had someone who says they didn't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=7650)|
| 2:07:32| Make sure they know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=7652)|
| 2:07:33| Go out and fix the problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=7653)|
| 2:07:34| Remedy the issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=7654)|
| 2:07:35| So that's where we spend a lot of our conversation, and, again, people have been very willing to do those things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=7655)|
| 2:07:41| They want to be good neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=7661)|
| 2:07:44| Ms. O'Hara, let me ask you some questions about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=7664)|
| 2:07:48| We've heard a lot of discussion this evening about if there were maybe some changes that needed to be made or some thoughts about making some changes to the short-term rental ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=7668)|
| 2:08:01| Given Section 13-7-601 and thereafter, if we were to make changes, substantive changes, to the Knoxville's short-term rental ordinance, would we be creating a new type of short-term rental?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=7681)|
| 2:08:20| Like we have type 1 and type 2, and type 3 doesn't really exist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=7700)|
| 2:08:26| Would we be creating a new one, a type 4?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=7706)|
| 2:08:29| Because I guess the grandfathering clause would protect all the ones that are going on right now, and they'd stay under the rules as of right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=7709)|
| 2:08:39| It would only be future ones after any changes that would be a different classification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=7719)|
| 2:08:46| If that is how you structured it in the ordinance, is that it would be a type 4, then yes, those would be a new type of permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=7726)|
| 2:08:55| However, it really is about the law that applies at the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=7735)|
| 2:08:59| So you're looking at the date that it's been held out as a short-term rental unit as to which law applies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=7739)|
| 2:09:06| And that section is 13-7-603 that says that it's the law that applies at the time that it is held out as a short-term rental unit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=7746)|
| 2:09:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=7756)|
| 2:09:17| And so you've looked at our statute and TCA 13-7-601.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=7757)|
| 2:09:24| Do you see – I wanted to get into some specific areas, though, but were there any things that you saw that are overruled and unenforceable by the state statute 13-7-601?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=7764)|
| 2:09:41| I think we've talked about here the revocation that is not consistent with state law or being continued use as a short-term rental unit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=7781)|
| 2:09:51| That is not consistent with state law the way it is now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=7791)|
| 2:09:56| It is – I would not say it's inconsistent, but it does not have the three stripes in your ordinance, so it would not be able to be enforced as written in your ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=7796)|
| 2:10:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=7805)|
| 2:10:06| We'd have to comply with the three stripes rule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=7806)|
| 2:10:09| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=7809)|
| 2:10:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=7810)|
| 2:10:11| But there's nothing in there that would prevent the limit of one permit per property owner in a type 1 short-term rental?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=7811)|
| 2:10:19| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=7819)|
| 2:10:20| And there's nothing that would limit a type 1 to only natural persons?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=7820)|
| 2:10:25| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=7825)|
| 2:10:31| And I would assume there's nothing in there that would preclude you from saying that you had to notify neighbors within 48 hours of –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=7831)|
| 2:10:39| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=7839)|
| 2:10:40| There's nothing that precludes that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=7840)|
| 2:10:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=7841)|
| 2:10:47| I think that's all the questions I have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=7847)|
| 2:10:50| I want to thank you all for coming and having a really good discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=7850)|
| 2:10:54| I thought all the questions were really good today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=7854)|
| 2:10:56| You know, I think we've identified some issues that we're certainly hearing about, and I think you are too, about, you know, how these are – how short-term rentals are being looked into with investigations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=7856)|
| 2:11:08| I think we'll all endeavor to try to share the phone number that you've shared with us with folks as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=7868)|
| 2:11:15| But I look forward to continuing conversations and want to thank you all for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=7875)|
| 2:11:19| You're quite welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=7879)|
| 2:11:20| And truly, if you have those complaints, send them our way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=7880)|
| 2:11:23| We're happy to address them through that method as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=7883)|
| 2:11:26| Very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=7886)|
| 2:11:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=7887)|
| 2:11:28| This meeting is adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-221110?start=7888)|
