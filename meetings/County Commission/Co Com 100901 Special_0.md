| 0:34:34| I have struggled with this decision since the whole people had made it known that they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=2074)|
| 0:34:42| were running and I'm friends with all of them and it was a hard decision to make, but I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=2082)|
| 0:34:50| was supporting whoever does get the vice-chair as well as even if they're not, it was a hard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=2090)|
| 0:35:01| decision and I just want to let that record be known.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=2101)|
| 0:35:06| Seeing no other comments, our candidates are Brad Anders, Tony Norman, and Dave Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=2106)|
| 0:35:11| We'll begin the voting process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=2111)|
| 0:35:12| Again, it will take six votes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=2112)|
| 0:35:14| Should not have, oh I'm sorry Dave, Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=2114)|
| 0:35:17| Let me take just a second to say that I've been a member of commission now two and a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=2117)|
| 0:35:22| half years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=2122)|
| 0:35:25| Knox County has been looking for a new commission for many, many years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=2125)|
| 0:35:34| I've been at this for approximately three since picking up a petition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=2134)|
| 0:35:40| I appreciate what Dr. Briggs has had to say and I really want to reinforce what Commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=2140)|
| 0:35:46| McKenzie has said about chair and waiting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=2146)|
| 0:35:52| I'm the first to stand up and say I don't want to commit to anything until the vote takes place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=2152)|
| 0:35:58| I even say that to my wife who may or may not still be here right at the moment, but that's the way I feel about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=2158)|
| 0:36:05| what's taking place in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=2165)|
| 0:36:10| I have been vice-chair of the finance committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=2170)|
| 0:36:15| I've seen a little bit of how I may deal with meetings or not, but the most important thing that I need to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=2175)|
| 0:36:22| emphasize is that I've said since beginning conversations with my wife or with whoever about vice-chair, I know that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=2182)|
| 0:36:33| needs to be, as Commissioner Broyles has said, a one-year thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=2193)|
| 0:36:38| It's the person that is ready every meeting to make sure the meeting moves along, just in case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=2198)|
| 0:36:46| It may never be called upon, but just in case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=2206)|
| 0:36:49| That's one of the things I found out as the vice-chair of finance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=2209)|
| 0:36:56| So as we sit here and talk about this, it's one of those things that's important because you've got to have them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=2216)|
| 0:37:07| but I view any person sitting here could be the vice-chair, and I would hope that any person sitting here on County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=2227)|
| 0:37:14| Commission could be the chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=2234)|
| 0:37:16| Thank you for your confidence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=2236)|
| 0:37:19| Mr. Broyles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=2239)|
| 0:37:21| I just wanted to comment, Dave, that that's kind of like the runner-up in the Miss America pageant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=2241)|
| 0:37:26| If for some reason the person who wins can no longer serve, that person steps forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=2246)|
| 0:37:31| And I think you're right that any person on here could do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=2251)|
| 0:37:34| This is an incredibly talented group of commissioners, and I'm very honored to serve with all of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=2254)|
| 0:37:41| And I hope that, like I said, over the next six years that I'm going to be here that we see a lot of chairs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=2261)|
| 0:37:48| and vice-chairs be elected and have a chance to serve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=2268)|
| 0:37:54| Let's begin the voting process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=2274)|

| 0:38:19| This is one of those hard votes, and I hope everyone understands I'm voting for seniority because we have three excellent people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=2299)|
| 0:38:26| but my vote goes to Tony Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=2306)|
| 0:38:28| Commissioner Briggs votes for Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=2308)|

| 0:39:31| Dave Wright, three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=2371)|
| 0:39:32| There were two passes, so one candidate did not get six votes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=2372)|

| 0:39:41| So, clerk, let's begin the voting process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=2381)|
| 0:39:45| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=2385)|

| 0:40:33| Commissioner Shouse votes for Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=2433)|
| 0:40:40| Does the pass wish to vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=2440)|
| 0:40:44| You want to vote first?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=2444)|
| 0:40:45| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=2445)|
| 0:40:51| There's one prerogative of a chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=2451)|
| 0:40:54| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=2454)|
| 0:40:58| Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=2458)|
| 0:41:01| Commissioner Norman votes for Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=2461)|
| 0:41:06| No, I wanted this to be a commission decision, not a Mike Hammond decision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=2466)|
| 0:41:09| so I'm going to let the commission make that vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=2469)|
| 0:41:19| The vote is six for Brad Anders, four for Dave Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=2479)|
| 0:41:22| If I might have just a moment, commissioners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=2482)|
| 0:41:44| I'd ask for the opportunity to address you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=2504)|
| 0:41:46| and I'd like to do that now before we get into our business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=2506)|
| 0:41:49| I have some prepared remarks, and I would like to say, first of all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=2509)|
| 0:41:52| thank you for giving me the opportunity to serve you as chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=2512)|
| 0:41:55| And as I said before, I'm voluntarily term limiting myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=2515)|
| 0:41:58| Whatever Commissioner Briggs brings forward I will support,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=2518)|
| 0:42:01| because I believe that there are many people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=2521)|
| 0:42:03| everyone on this commission could be chair or vice chair,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=2523)|
| 0:42:05| and I believe deserves the opportunity to serve in a leadership position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=2525)|
| 0:42:09| But today we have a new and much needed era that's beginning for Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=2529)|
| 0:42:14| and our Knox County Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=2534)|
| 0:42:17| During the last three years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=2537)|
| 0:42:18| government has generally suffered from a loss of public confidence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=2538)|
| 0:42:21| and that's not the public's fault.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=2541)|
| 0:42:23| That's government's fault.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=2543)|
| 0:42:25| That means it is a responsibility, the obligation, the duty of each of us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=2545)|
| 0:42:30| to restore public confidence in what we do and how we do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=2550)|
| 0:42:35| Confidence does not mean agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=2555)|
| 0:42:37| In a county of 400,000 citizens,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=2557)|
| 0:42:39| we're not going to arrive at unanimous agreement on hardly anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=2559)|
| 0:42:43| We won't always have unanimous agreement on this commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=2563)|
| 0:42:46| but what we can and must do is work to achieve the understanding among our citizens| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=2566)|
| 0:42:50| that we are indeed working in their interests and for their interests,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=2570)|
| 0:42:54| and we're doing it honorably.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=2574)|
| 0:42:56| The day is important because we've just inaugurated a mayor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=2576)|
| 0:42:59| who has run on a platform of a new direction for Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=2579)|
| 0:43:03| That is important for the mayor's office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=2583)|
| 0:43:05| but the only people that can make a difference on Knox County Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=2585)|
| 0:43:08| are sitting at this table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=2588)|
| 0:43:10| We have a smaller 11-member commission, the elected representatives of the people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=2590)|
| 0:43:16| Having gotten to know my fellow commissioners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=2596)|
| 0:43:18| I know that there are a lot of talent here, there's a lot of creativity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=2598)|
| 0:43:22| I'll be calling on that talent and creativity a lot over the next few months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=2602)|
| 0:43:27| To be effective, I believe that we must be an informed body| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=2607)|
| 0:43:30| because there are 11, every vote is vital, every vote will be crucial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=2610)|
| 0:43:35| So I'm announcing today some actions that I believe will help achieve that goal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=2615)|
| 0:43:40| First, the school system's importance to our county is well known.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=2620)|
| 0:43:44| Communication between the school board and the county commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=2624)|
| 0:43:47| has been less than stellar over the last few years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=2627)|
| 0:43:50| In an effort to keep that dynamic occurring,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=2630)|
| 0:43:52| I plan to meet with the school board chairperson at least monthly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=2632)|
| 0:43:55| and while we may not always agree, we can always be agreeable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=2635)|
| 0:43:59| In the spirit of cooperation, I have asked the schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=2639)|
| 0:44:02| if the Knox County Commission could host a reception for the school board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=2642)|
| 0:44:05| prior to their swearing in on September 7.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=2645)|
| 0:44:08| They have agreed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=2648)|
| 0:44:09| I hope that you will join me as host for that reception at 4 o'clock on September 7.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=2649)|
| 0:44:16| It's my goal to hold quarterly meetings with the school board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=2656)|
| 0:44:19| with the Knoxville City Council and the Farragut Board of Aldermen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=2659)|
| 0:44:22| because we all serve the same people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=2662)|
| 0:44:24| Our residents are all county residents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=2664)|
| 0:44:26| The more we can talk to each other, the better I believe that we can serve our constituents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=2666)|
| 0:44:31| Before each regular monthly commission meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=2671)|
| 0:44:33| I plan to host the chairman's lunch that will occur from 11.30 until 1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=2673)|
| 0:44:37| We will have an agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=2677)|
| 0:44:38| It is my hope that we can have discussion items there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=2678)|
| 0:44:41| and as Mr. Norman said, we need to make our meetings more productive and businesslike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=2681)|
| 0:44:45| I'm hopeful that during that lunch period that we can have some discussion items,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=2685)|
| 0:44:48| that we can have some things that will be outside of the commission meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=2688)|
| 0:44:51| that are not voting matters, but things for an opportunity for us to be informed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=2691)|
| 0:44:56| These will be, of course, properly noticed, and they will be televised.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=2696)|
| 0:45:01| Sheriff Jones and I have had a discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=2701)|
| 0:45:03| He has agreed to host a meeting on September 9 at 5 o'clock at the detention facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=2703)|
| 0:45:07| I think it's important that we understand their issues with regards to the proposed safety center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=2707)|
| 0:45:15| So he has agreed to host luncheon for us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=2715)|
| 0:45:17| and he's going to have his people come and let us ask questions about the proposed safety center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=2717)|
| 0:45:23| I've also asked the schools if we could meet at Carter Elementary School during the course of the school day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=2723)|
| 0:45:28| I talked to Superintendent McIntyre before the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=2728)|
| 0:45:30| He has agreed to do that, and so we will be setting a time where we as commission can go to Carter Elementary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=2730)|
| 0:45:35| talk with the people there, and again be informed so that we can make our decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=2735)|
| 0:45:41| Also, some of you have told me that you want to have a retreat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=2741)|
| 0:45:44| I think that that's vital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=2744)|
| 0:45:46| I think that we need to sit down and talk about how we do business, how we run our office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=2746)|
| 0:45:50| and how we basically do the work of the people of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=2750)|
| 0:45:53| I'm going to ask the commission office to get in touch with you about some available dates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=2753)|
| 0:45:57| so that we can sit down and really talk about how we do business, the people's business, here in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=2757)|
| 0:46:03| So again, I want to say thank you so that hopefully at the end of four years or six years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=2763)|
| 0:46:09| we can all look back and say that we did our best| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=2769)|
| 0:46:12| and that the people's confidence in this commission has been restored.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=2772)|
| 0:46:17| So ladies and gentlemen, fasten your seatbelts and make sure that your seats are in their locked and upright positions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=2777)|
| 0:46:21| because we're taking off and our destination is better government for Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=2781)|
| 0:46:26| Commissioner Burroughs, I would like to ask you if you would look at the possibility of having our November meeting at Fulton High School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=2786)|
| 0:46:32| I believe it's important that we get out of this building and into the community so people can see how the sausage is being made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=2792)|
| 0:46:37| And if you could report back to us on September 20th about that possibility, it will be something that we can discuss.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=2797)|
| 0:46:42| I have two questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=2802)|
| 0:46:45| On the November meeting at Fulton High School, which I think is an excellent idea,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=2805)|
| 0:46:49| and thank you for having it in the first one in my district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=2809)|
| 0:46:53| I'm anxious for you all to see how much progress Fulton has made in the last couple of years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=2813)|
| 0:46:57| It's really phenomenal. I'm very, very proud of that school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=2817)|
| 0:47:01| But do you want to have lunch there in the cafeteria with the students at 1130 and have that be your chairman's lunch| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=2821)|
| 0:47:08| and then go into session after that at 2 o'clock?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=2828)|
| 0:47:11| Yes, what I'd like for you to do is just ask the school because they don't know anything about this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=2831)|
| 0:47:14| and also the commissioners need to approve too. I'm throwing it out as an option or a possibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=2834)|
| 0:47:18| I think it's a great idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=2838)|
| 0:47:19| So if you could come and report back to us on how that would work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=2839)|
| 0:47:22| If it doesn't work, it doesn't work, but I'd like for us to explore the possibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=2842)|
| 0:47:25| I have another question about the September 9th meeting at the detention facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=2845)|
| 0:47:29| And is that to start at 1130 a.m.?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=2849)|
| 0:47:31| No, that's at 5 p.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=2851)|
| 0:47:32| 5 p.m. Okay, so it's not a lunch meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=2852)|
| 0:47:34| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=2854)|
| 0:47:35| Okay. And that meeting will be open to the public, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=2855)|
| 0:47:38| Yes, it will be properly noticed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=2858)|
| 0:47:39| There are a great many people in the 2nd District who are concerned about the safety center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=2859)|
| 0:47:48| The majority of the people, I'm convinced, believe that it's a good idea and would like to see it go forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=2868)|
| 0:47:53| But I want to make sure that my constituents in the 2nd District know that this meeting is taking place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=2873)|
| 0:47:58| and make sure that they understand that they're welcome to attend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=2878)|
| 0:48:01| Now, I'm not sure about it. We'll have to ask the sheriff about getting them in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=2881)|
| 0:48:04| But as far as it being noticed and the media being available, they will be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=2884)|
| 0:48:07| But I'll talk with the sheriff about that to see if, indeed, some constituents show up and we can accommodate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=2887)|
| 0:48:11| That would be wonderful. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=2891)|
| 0:48:15| These educational forums, I realize that not everybody will be able to come,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=2895)|
| 0:48:18| but my goal is if you can't come to give you a briefing and give you a memo on exactly what was discussed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=2898)|
| 0:48:23| so that you can be properly informed on all of those things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=2903)|
| 0:48:26| We do have an agenda, but, Commissioner Smith, your light's on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=2906)|
| 0:48:29| Yes, I'd like to add something to the agenda and have the law director chime in at the appropriate time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=2909)|
| 0:48:35| on the pension, or not the pension, but the severance packages and see what we can do about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=2915)|
| 0:48:41| Mr. Law Director, we have two items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=2921)|
| 0:48:43| Our mayor has asked for a called meeting on September the 7th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=2923)|
| 0:48:47| And also we have a discussion item about the severance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=2927)|
| 0:48:51| Do we suspend the rules?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=2931)|
| 0:48:53| You'd have to, sir, because under your rules you can't add anything to an agenda during the course of a special called meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=2933)|
| 0:48:59| With a two-thirds vote, you can suspend your rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=2939)|
| 0:49:02| I would just caution you about making any definitive decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=2942)|
| 0:49:06| It would be better to be more speculative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=2946)|
| 0:49:08| But with that, you can suspend your rules to proceed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=2948)|
| 0:49:11| However, in accordance with your rules, your next order of business would be the selecting the members of the committee on committees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=2951)|
| 0:49:19| So, again, you can defer that to another date, but you'd have to suspend your rules to do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=2959)|
| 0:49:25| If we could go to the committee on committees first, then I'll get right back to you, Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=2965)|
| 0:49:29| I want to make a recommendation to the body, and that is this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=2969)|
| 0:49:34| I'd like to select the committee on committees today and name those persons,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=2974)|
| 0:49:37| but I would like to hold off on the naming of committees until a subsequent meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=2977)|
| 0:49:42| The reason being is I would like for each of you to look at the committees and give me some ideas to what you would like to serve on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=2982)|
| 0:49:48| And we will, at that time, come back and have the selection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=2988)|
| 0:49:54| The committee on committees will then make those selections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=2994)|
| 0:49:56| We need a chair and a vice chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=2996)|
| 0:49:58| That's going to take a little bit of time, but more importantly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=2998)|
| 0:50:01| I would like for you to chime in on what committees that you would like to serve on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=3001)|
| 0:50:04| If that's acceptable to the body, I'd like to name the committee on committees today with them reporting back to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=3004)|
| 0:50:15| Do we need to make a motion to that effect?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=3015)|
| 0:50:17| Well, again, because the way you amended your rules last time, you would actually start meeting into separate groups.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=3017)|
| 0:50:23| If you're going to defer that, your best bet is just suspend the rules now, move forward with that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=3023)|
| 0:50:28| and then any other items you wish to discuss, remembering you do still have several other items,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=3028)|
| 0:50:34| including the spreading of the bombs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=3034)|
| 0:50:36| Well, I make the motion then to suspend the rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=3036)|
| 0:50:38| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=3038)|
| 0:50:39| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=3039)|
| 0:50:40| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=3040)|
| 0:50:41| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=3041)|
| 0:50:42| Any opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=3042)|
| 0:50:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=3043)|
| 0:50:44| The rules are suspended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=3044)|
| 0:50:46| For the committee on committees, I'd like to ask Commissioners McKenzie, Broyles, Norman, Brown, and Wright to serve on that committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=3046)|
| 0:50:53| And, again, I would like for the commissioners to let the office know of any committees that you would like to serve on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=3053)|
| 0:51:00| And we will, if you don't have anything that you would like to serve on, we will go ahead and make those appointments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=3060)|
| 0:51:05| But I'd like to do that at a subsequent meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=3065)|
| 0:51:08| Commissioner Shouse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=3068)|
| 0:51:09| Thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=3069)|
| 0:51:10| Just a clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=3070)|
| 0:51:11| Are we, we discussed this very late last Monday night, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=3071)|
| 0:51:15| Is the finance and intergovernment becoming one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=3075)|
| 0:51:17| Are those two committees gone away?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=3077)|
| 0:51:19| Those committees have gone away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=3079)|
| 0:51:20| So you're talking about committees like?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=3080)|
| 0:51:22| I'm talking about insolvency board, rules committee, procurement committee, cable TV, yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=3082)|
| 0:51:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=3086)|
| 0:51:27| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=3087)|
| 0:51:28| And I'll need to get a list, I guess I can get it from the office, because we did away with some of those out of efficiency and other reasons, didn't we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=3088)|
| 0:51:33| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=3093)|
| 0:51:34| Jolie, would you, Jolie will send each of you a list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=3094)|
| 0:51:36| But, again, I'd like for you, if you have a particular passion for something, I'd like for you to serve on that committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=3096)|
| 0:51:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=3099)|
| 0:51:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=3100)|
| 0:51:41| What you're referring to, Commissioner Shouse, is actually number three on your agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=3101)|
| 0:51:43| You'll actually get to the dissolution of your previous committee, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=3103)|
| 0:51:48| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=3108)|
| 0:51:51| Next on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=3111)|
| 0:51:52| One thing on that, the, sorry, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=3112)|
| 0:51:55| Yes, no, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=3115)|
| 0:51:57| The previous committee list that was passed out was pretty dated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=3117)|
| 0:52:02| So if we could, when that, when Jolie gets that, if we get an up-to-date listing of who served on the previous commission, that would be great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=3122)|
| 0:52:11| And one of the reasons why I would like to, there were a lot of committees I didn't know I was even on, and I didn't know what they did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=3131)|
| 0:52:16| And so I would like to just kind of redefine, because I would really like to see our committee process strengthened so that we can do some business, you know, with these committees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=3136)|
| 0:52:24| Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=3144)|
| 0:52:25| I think it's important that with the dissolving of two other, the finance intergovernmental,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=3145)|
| 0:52:32| there was also some committees that those, or some boards that those chairmen sat on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=3152)|
| 0:52:38| And with those being dissolved, we need to make sure, get the list of, I think it's the industrial development board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=3158)|
| 0:52:44| a few other things where the chairman of those committees along with the chairman of the commission sat on those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=3164)|
| 0:52:48| So we need to make sure those vacancies are filled with another commissioner that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=3168)|
| 0:52:52| since we don't have chairman of intergovernmental and finance, we need to make sure that those boards are also filled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=3172)|
| 0:53:02| Commissioner Burroughs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=3182)|
| 0:53:04| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=3184)|
| 0:53:06| And, again, it was late when we had this discussion a couple of Monday nights ago after our meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=3186)|
| 0:53:10| Did we agree that the, since finance and intergovernmental are going away, that we're going to have our first work study session?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=3190)|
| 0:53:21| Is that going to be in the afternoon, or is that going to be in the morning?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=3201)|
| 0:53:24| Had we decided that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=3204)|
| 0:53:25| That's our next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=3205)|
| 0:53:26| That's in the resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=3206)|
| 0:53:27| There's a blank space for you to fill in for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=3207)|
| 0:53:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=3209)|
| 0:53:31| What I would like to suggest is that the committee on committees meet either immediately after that meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=3211)|
| 0:53:41| if it's in the morning, or if it takes place in the afternoon, that we meet an hour before that meeting is scheduled to start.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=3221)|
| 0:53:48| We're all going to be here anyway for a committee meeting, or a commission meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=3228)|
| 0:53:52| We may as well make use of our time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=3232)|
| 0:53:56| I also wonder about the pension board, which I believe meets before the next commission meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=3236)|
| 0:54:03| Do we need to go ahead and appoint someone to the pension board for that meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=3243)|
| 0:54:07| We have two other meetings that are coming up on the 7th, and also there's another one that we'll be talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=3247)|
| 0:54:14| So if you can hold that, I think we can set that meeting here very shortly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=3254)|
| 0:54:18| Let's go on to number three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=3258)|
| 0:54:19| Clerk, if you'd read item number three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=3259)|
| 0:54:21| Item number three is a resolution regarding proposed amendments to the Knox County Commission rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=3261)|
| 0:54:26| This is resolution R-10-9-101-SS.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=3266)|
| 0:54:32| This is exactly what we were talking about, the time that we would meet in the work session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=3272)|
| 0:54:36| There was consideration of a two o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=3276)|
| 0:54:38| There was consideration of a four o'clock or any other time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=3278)|
| 0:54:40| Does anyone have a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=3280)|
| 0:54:41| Commissioner Anders?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=3281)|
| 0:54:42| I'd like to make the motion we make it two o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=3282)|
| 0:54:45| Two reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=3285)|
| 0:54:46| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=3286)|
| 0:54:47| It helps some of us, you know, with work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=3287)|
| 0:54:51| It helps us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=3291)|
| 0:54:52| It ensures that we don't go off into the late night hours, hopefully.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=3292)|
| 0:54:56| And also it gives us continuity between the commission meeting and the workshop, or both the two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=3296)|
| 0:55:00| There's nothing to have to remember for the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=3300)|
| 0:55:02| And so it's just continuity, simple, and it helps most of the commissioners on the committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=3302)|
| 0:55:07| The motion is to pass the resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=3307)|
| 0:55:10| I'd like to make a motion to pass the resolution adding 2 p.m. to that work study, work session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=3310)|
| 0:55:16| It's been made and properly seconded by Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=3316)|
| 0:55:18| Discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=3318)|
| 0:55:19| Commissioner McKenzie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=3319)|
| 0:55:20| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=3320)|
| 0:55:21| I guess I'm looking at this from a different point of view,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=3321)|
| 0:55:24| and that point of view I think was eloquently displayed last commission meeting on August 23rd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=3324)|
| 0:55:34| Commissioner Armstrong, I think, asked that the Carter issue be tabled until 6.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=3334)|
| 0:55:41| And they came out in strength.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=3341)|
| 0:55:43| The community wanted to come out and be a part of a process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=3343)|
| 0:55:48| and they could not because most of the folks in the Carter community and my community are working people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=3348)|
| 0:55:53| and that they need to be heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=3353)|
| 0:55:56| And having 2 o'clock meetings caused them undue stress and strain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=3356)|
| 0:56:01| So when that they started rolling in here at about 4 or 4.30.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=3361)|
| 0:56:06| So I think that speaks clearly to what the citizens want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=3366)|
| 0:56:10| We can talk about what's best for us and best for ours, and we can argue those points,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=3370)|
| 0:56:14| and we'll probably come on different sides of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=3374)|
| 0:56:17| But I think in the final analysis, if we're going to have a work session,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=3377)|
| 0:56:21| a session where people can come and take part of a process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=3381)|
| 0:56:26| take part of a substantial discussion on a particular issue or on an agenda item,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=3386)|
| 0:56:33| the best time is to have it after the work hour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=3393)|
| 0:56:37| I think that's doing a service to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=3397)|
| 0:56:40| Yes, it's inconvenience for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=3400)|
| 0:56:42| Okay, it keeps us here a little late, but that's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=3402)|
| 0:56:46| It may be inconvenient to the mayor's staff and his department heads,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=3406)|
| 0:56:50| but I would hope that they're salaried employees and there's no additional compensation for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=3410)|
| 0:56:56| If it is, there shouldn't be, at least for the professional staff, and we need to take a look at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=3416)|
| 0:57:01| If we're here about service, and we've heard a lot of that about doing what the people want,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=3421)|
| 0:57:08| the people come out after their work hours, and if they have an issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=3428)|
| 0:57:13| to say you have an issue that's burning in you to the point where you want to come| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=3433)|
| 0:57:18| and be heard at a commission meeting, well, you're going to need to take a half-day vacation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=3438)|
| 0:57:22| or worse than that, take a half-day off without pay, you know, speaks a lot to what we're really about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=3442)|
| 0:57:30| So, you know, I know there's some strong statements out there, but I feel pretty strongly about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=3450)|
| 0:57:35| Just consistency for consistency's sake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=3455)|
| 0:57:38| If this is a work session, it needs to stand on its own legs, not just because we're meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=3458)|
| 0:57:43| having a commission meeting at two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=3463)|
| 0:57:45| I think this session needs to stand on its own, and we need to have it at an appropriate time for our constituents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=3465)|
| 0:57:53| Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=3473)|
| 0:57:55| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=3475)|
| 0:57:57| I think there's validity in both of those positions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=3477)|
| 0:58:02| One thing that might be a compromise is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=3482)|
| 0:58:05| or a compromise view in accommodating people who have to deal with work issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=3485)|
| 0:58:13| and then participate in trying to get to the workshop would be that this meeting is not going to be a short meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=3493)|
| 0:58:22| If it starts at two o'clock, we're going to be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=3502)|
| 0:58:25| These issues that we have, this is not going to be an hour-and-a-half meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=3505)|
| 0:58:31| So there's going to be some length to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=3511)|
| 0:58:36| I think two o'clock's probably a decent compromise such that if we had a hot issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=3516)|
| 0:58:42| and we know people are wanting to get there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=3522)|
| 0:58:45| that we could accommodate them some way within that time frame so that they could at four o'clock or 430.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=3525)|
| 0:58:53| I anticipate being here well into the night if the meeting starts at two for any type of, I mean, you know how we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=3533)|
| 0:59:03| I mean, it's going to be long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=3543)|
| 0:59:06| Commissioner Olinby.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=3546)|
| 0:59:10| I agree with Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=3550)|
| 0:59:13| I've got a lot of calls and a lot of people that have suggested that it happen later in the afternoon so that they can get here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=3553)|
| 0:59:21| especially for the Carter situations or topics that we're discussing or any other topic that may come up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=3561)|
| 0:59:28| A lot of people can't take off from work to get down here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=3568)|
| 0:59:32| I would suggest that it be later, but if we agree at two, I'm happy with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=3572)|
| 0:59:38| But I would suggest, you know, four or six o'clock would be my suggestion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=3578)|
| 0:59:44| Mr. Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=3584)|
| 0:59:45| You know, I agree with what Sam says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=3585)|
| 0:59:47| but I also remember when we had this same discussion back in February and March of 2008,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=3587)|
| 0:59:54| when we said let's start the meetings at five or six and that way people have to work and come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=3594)|
| 0:59:59| And what were happening, we had people coming to the meetings, and they were sitting there until 1.30 in the morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=3599)|
| 1:00:06| And that's just as hard on a working person as having to leave work a little bit early.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=3606)|
| 1:00:11| I think that if we did start our meetings that late, there's going to be people going to be here until midnight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=3611)|
| 1:00:16| if the discussions get long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=3616)|
| 1:00:19| And I think that two o'clock is probably an appropriate time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=3619)|
| 1:00:23| I think that probably some of these meetings will go past five or 5.30 in the evening,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=3623)|
| 1:00:29| where people who are coming in will have the opportunity to come and let their views be known.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=3629)|
| 1:00:34| I also don't forget we still have the commission meeting a week later,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=3634)|
| 1:00:38| and that's actually where we're going to be voting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=3638)|
| 1:00:41| And the citizens will have an opportunity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=3641)|
| 1:00:43| and if there's a request that we put something on right after the zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=3643)|
| 1:00:48| they would still have an opportunity that evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=3648)|
| 1:00:50| And I would hope that some of those that may involve citizen participation or citizen input,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=3650)|
| 1:00:55| they would have the opportunity at the meeting where we're actually voting to be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=3655)|
| 1:01:01| And I personally think that two o'clock is probably not an unreasonable time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=3661)|
| 1:01:05| I would be glad to start it later because I'm a working person, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=3665)|
| 1:01:09| But it is also really tough to have people sitting out there until midnight or one o'clock or 1.30,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=3669)|
| 1:01:14| and we've seen that happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=3674)|
| 1:01:16| Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=3676)|
| 1:01:18| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=3678)|
| 1:01:20| What we're doing is a change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=3680)|
| 1:01:22| This meeting has been at 8.30 in the morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=3682)|
| 1:01:25| Now we're talking about it being at two o'clock in the afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=3685)|
| 1:01:29| We talked, as Dr. Briggs has said, we had a different procedure a couple of years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=3689)|
| 1:01:34| If we need to change in a couple of months, we can change again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=3694)|
| 1:01:37| This is not something that will be with us forever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=3697)|
| 1:01:39| So let's sort of strike a little bit of middle ground here in middle of the afternoon,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=3699)|
| 1:01:44| and hopefully we won't be here after 10 o'clock, but we can wait and see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=3704)|
| 1:01:48| And if it turns out that these meetings are only a couple of hours long,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=3708)|
| 1:01:52| then four o'clock would be a fine time to start.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=3712)|
| 1:01:55| Mr. Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=3715)|
| 1:01:57| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=3717)|
| 1:01:59| One thing that I agree mostly with what Dr. Briggs said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=3719)|
| 1:02:03| but for Commissioner Ornby talking about issues like the Carter School issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=3723)|
| 1:02:08| these are zoning issues, which is already a set time of six o'clock anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=3728)|
| 1:02:12| So that gives the general public time to be here upon such items as that was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=3732)|
| 1:02:19| and it worked out fine last month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=3739)|
| 1:02:22| I think that two o'clock is an acceptable time, and that would be my vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=3742)|
| 1:02:28| Mr. Shouse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=3748)|
| 1:02:30| I'm leaning more towards a two o'clock time frame.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=3750)|
| 1:02:33| I'd like four o'clock at the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=3753)|
| 1:02:36| We can have a go, but I know Commissioner Burroughs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=3756)|
| 1:02:38| you seemed to have some problems the other night about a four o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=3758)|
| 1:02:42| Was that school and things?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=3762)|
| 1:02:44| So I would lean towards more two o'clock, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=3764)|
| 1:02:48| As Commissioner Wright said, now these things are 830 in the morning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=3768)|
| 1:02:51| and practically everyone is working at 830 in the morning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=3771)|
| 1:02:54| so there's a conflict there already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=3774)|
| 1:02:57| I'm just hoping, I don't mind debate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=3777)|
| 1:02:59| If it's a 12-hour debate, that's fine,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=3779)|
| 1:03:01| but there are 11 debaters now instead of 19.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=3781)|
| 1:03:06| I don't foresee any of these 10-hour meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=3786)|
| 1:03:09| I hope not anyway, but if we need to sit here that long, that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=3789)|
| 1:03:12| But I'm leaning towards a two o'clock myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=3792)|
| 1:03:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=3794)|
| 1:03:16| The motion on the floor is to amend the resolution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=3796)|
| 1:03:18| which would have a two o'clock time for the work session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=3798)|
| 1:03:22| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=3802)|
| 1:03:24| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=3804)|
| 1:03:25| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=3805)|
| 1:03:27| Ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=3807)|
| 1:03:30| Clerk, item number four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=3810)|
| 1:03:32| Item four is consideration of the date for the public meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=3812)|
| 1:03:36| to select a person to fill the position of State Senate District 7, Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=3816)|
| 1:03:41| until on or about November 2, 2010, as a result of a vacancy in that office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=3821)|
| 1:03:47| Commissioners, in just a few moments we're going to be hearing from the individuals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=3827)|
| 1:03:50| who are seeking this position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=3830)|
| 1:03:53| In talking with our law director,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=3833)|
| 1:03:55| he is suggesting that we have a September 13th date to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=3835)|
| 1:04:00| This room is available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=3840)|
| 1:04:02| That gives us the 10-day window that some have said that we needed to abide by.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=3842)|
| 1:04:06| That is on a Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=3846)|
| 1:04:08| So is there a motion that we meet and at what time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=3848)|
| 1:04:14| I'd just like to point out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=3854)|
| 1:04:15| Question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=3855)|
| 1:04:17| Let me get Commissioner Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=3857)|
| 1:04:19| I'd just like to point out I'm not going to be available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=3859)|
| 1:04:21| We had a previously planned vacation for two weeks starting on Monday the 6th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=3861)|
| 1:04:26| whatever that date is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=3866)|
| 1:04:28| I'd like to be available, but if the state law says we have to vote within 10 days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=3868)|
| 1:04:32| we've got to vote within 10 days of the public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=3872)|
| 1:04:36| Mr. Law Director, the September 13th date, I don't think that's clad in stone, is it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=3876)|
| 1:04:40| That was just what we had looked at as the first possible date we could do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=3880)|
| 1:04:43| Well, so, yeah, it should be that date or thereafter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=3883)|
| 1:04:45| But you don't want to do it before that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=3885)|
| 1:04:48| I mean, could we, I mean, I'm just wondering,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=3888)|
| 1:04:50| could we do it that Monday when we're going to be having our work session?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=3890)|
| 1:04:57| Again, I'm looking at the law director on that time frame.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=3897)|
| 1:05:01| On the 20th?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=3901)|
| 1:05:02| Yes, sir, that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=3902)|
| 1:05:03| Could we do that on the 20th?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=3903)|
| 1:05:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=3904)|
| 1:05:05| Chairman, we had an audit committee scheduled for the 7th or, I guess, 7th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=3905)|
| 1:05:11| and it's been postponed due to conflicts and there's been a flurry of e-mails,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=3911)|
| 1:05:15| and the last I had, Joe, was 10th will be the 13th for an audit meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=3915)|
| 1:05:20| Am I right on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=3920)|
| 1:05:22| The last communication I received was that where we were leaning towards, sir,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=3922)|
| 1:05:27| hasn't been definitively decided.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=3927)|
| 1:05:29| The 13th or 20th, I believe, was what had been tossed out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=3929)|
| 1:05:32| and I said, well, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=3932)|
| 1:05:33| we're probably going to have this workshop meeting on the 20th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=3933)|
| 1:05:36| so I just want to consider this audit meeting if we meet on the 13th for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=3936)|
| 1:05:42| interview or the selection process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=3942)|
| 1:05:44| Well, the law director has said that we could meet on the 20th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=3944)|
| 1:05:47| We had looked at the 13th as the 10-day window,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=3947)|
| 1:05:49| but if that's not going to be an issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=3949)|
| 1:05:52| then that certainly could be considered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=3952)|
| 1:05:54| Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=3954)|
| 1:05:57| I'm out of town all that week, 13th through the 17th, so DC trip.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=3957)|
| 1:06:04| Commissioner Burwells.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=3964)|
| 1:06:06| I'd like to make a motion that we meet September 20th| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=3966)|
| 1:06:11| and that the first order of business on our agenda| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=3971)|
| 1:06:15| is making this appointment at 2 o'clock| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=3975)|
| 1:06:19| and that the committee on committees meet at 1 p.m. prior to that meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=3979)|
| 1:06:25| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=3985)|
| 1:06:26| Motion has been made and seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=3986)|
| 1:06:28| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=3988)|
| 1:06:29| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=3989)|
| 1:06:30| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=3990)|
| 1:06:31| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=3991)|
| 1:06:32| Ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=3992)|
| 1:06:33| Next item, clerk, number five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=3993)|
| 1:06:37| Spread of record officials bond according to law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=3997)|
| 1:06:43| Move for approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=4003)|
| 1:06:44| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=4004)|
| 1:06:45| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=4005)|
| 1:06:46| Motion has been made and seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=4006)|
| 1:06:47| Commissioner Burwells.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=4007)|
| 1:06:50| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=4010)|
| 1:06:52| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=4012)|
| 1:06:53| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=4013)|
| 1:06:54| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=4014)|
| 1:06:55| Ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=4015)|
| 1:06:58| Next item, our mayor has asked that we go into session on September 7th| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=4018)|
| 1:07:03| to approve the bond refiguration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=4023)|
| 1:07:10| so that we can save our taxpayers money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=4030)|
| 1:07:15| I guess the only issue that we have is the timing of that on September 7th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=4035)|
| 1:07:18| And as I understand it, is Mr. Rice here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=4038)|
| 1:07:21| Dean, do you want to address this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=4041)|
| 1:07:23| Or the mayor if the mayor is here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=4043)|
| 1:07:24| would you like to address why the September 7th date is critical?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=4044)|
| 1:07:27| Thank you, Mr. Chairman, Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=4047)|
| 1:07:29| The mayor needs to be on the 7th| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=4049)|
| 1:07:33| so that there can be a 30-day notice given to the bondholders| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=4053)|
| 1:07:36| for the refinancing of these three bonds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=4056)|
| 1:07:39| And we'll be providing you with, I'm sorry,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=4059)|
| 1:07:41| Dean Rice, Chief of Staff to Mayor Tim Burchett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=4061)|
| 1:07:44| But I'll be able to provide you all with information on this shortly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=4064)|
| 1:07:49| Just have gotten the computer turned on this morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=4069)|
| 1:07:51| So as soon as that's up and running, we'll have the information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=4071)|
| 1:07:55| But the discussion needs to take place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=4075)|
| 1:07:57| The vote needs to be taken within giving a 30-day notice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=4077)|
| 1:08:01| And if we pass that, the date of the 9th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=4081)|
| 1:08:05| then the October 9th date is the deadline to get this refinanced within that cycle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=4085)|
| 1:08:10| If we don't achieve that date, then there's a significant loss in the savings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=4090)|
| 1:08:16| Do you have a time in mind, sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=4096)|
| 1:08:18| 9 a.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=4098)|
| 1:08:19| A question in regard to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=4099)|
| 1:08:21| Yes, Mr. Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=4101)|
| 1:08:23| That's the same day we've got the reception for the school board at 4 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=4103)|
| 1:08:27| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=4107)|
| 1:08:28| How long is this going to take, Dean?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=4108)|
| 1:08:30| Ten minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=4110)|
| 1:08:31| It's up to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=4111)|
| 1:08:33| It can be very brief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=4113)|
| 1:08:34| As long as we've briefed you in advance, it can be simply a motion to approve,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=4114)|
| 1:08:38| and we can move forward with the notice to the bondholders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=4118)|
| 1:08:40| Rather than come twice that day, why not come at 3.30 and do this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=4120)|
| 1:08:46| and then we'll be set for the 4 o'clock for the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=4126)|
| 1:08:49| I'll make that in the form of a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=4129)|
| 1:08:51| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=4131)|
| 1:08:52| A motion has been made and seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=4132)|
| 1:08:53| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=4133)|
| 1:08:54| Is that all right with you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=4134)|
| 1:08:56| Dean, is that good with you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=4136)|
| 1:08:57| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=4137)|
| 1:08:58| Thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=4138)|
| 1:08:59| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=4139)|
| 1:09:00| But I just, I mean, I'd like to put a few hooks in us getting the information in a timely fashion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=4140)|
| 1:09:06| You'll have it by the end of the week, by closing business Friday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=4146)|
| 1:09:10| Any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=4150)|
| 1:09:11| Commissioner Brown, your light's on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=4151)|
| 1:09:12| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=4152)|
| 1:09:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=4153)|
| 1:09:15| Yes, Commissioner Burroughs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=4155)|
| 1:09:16| For clarification, we're going to meet in special session here at 3 p.m. to consider this bond issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=4156)|
| 1:09:22| 3.30.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=4162)|
| 1:09:23| 3.30, and then at 4 p.m. we go over to the Andrew Johnson Hotel for the, sorry,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=4163)|
| 1:09:29| Andrew Johnson Hotel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=4169)|
| 1:09:30| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=4170)|
| 1:09:31| For the school board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=4171)|
| 1:09:32| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=4172)|
| 1:09:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=4173)|
| 1:09:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=4174)|
| 1:09:35| Anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=4175)|
| 1:09:36| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=4176)|
| 1:09:37| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=4177)|
| 1:09:38| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=4178)|
| 1:09:39| 3.30 it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=4179)|
| 1:09:42| Secondly, we had a discussion item with regards to the severance pay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=4182)|
| 1:09:45| Commissioner Smith, you had brought that up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=4185)|
| 1:09:47| Yeah, I'd just like the law director to go ahead and weigh in and just tell us what our options are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=4187)|
| 1:09:51| And, you know, the public's pretty outraged about this and what can we do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=4191)|
| 1:09:54| and can we prevent this in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=4194)|
| 1:09:56| Can we take any action today or what can we do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=4196)|
| 1:09:58| And I may want to hear from the mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=4198)|
| 1:10:00| Point of order, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=4200)|
| 1:10:02| Is this added?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=4202)|
| 1:10:04| Have we properly added this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=4204)|
| 1:10:06| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=4206)|
| 1:10:07| We had suspended the rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=4207)|
| 1:10:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=4208)|
| 1:10:09| But that was for another issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=4209)|
| 1:10:10| This was not for this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=4210)|
| 1:10:13| By suspending the rules, you can add an item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=4213)|
| 1:10:16| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=4216)|
| 1:10:17| I thought that was actually added.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=4217)|
| 1:10:19| If Commissioner Smith wants to make a motion to discuss it, we can move forward with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=4219)|
| 1:10:24| Commissioner Smith had mentioned earlier he wanted to discuss this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=4224)|
| 1:10:27| And then we had the September 7th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=4227)|
| 1:10:28| That was when we suspended the rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=4228)|
| 1:10:32| Do I need to make that as a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=4232)|
| 1:10:34| I can make a motion if you want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=4234)|
| 1:10:36| I prefer it, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=4236)|
| 1:10:37| I'll make a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=4237)|
| 1:10:38| We spend five minutes on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=4238)|
| 1:10:41| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=4241)|
| 1:10:42| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=4242)|
| 1:10:44| Mr. Burrells?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=4244)|
| 1:10:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=4246)|
| 1:10:48| Mr. Rice, would you come back to the podium?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=4248)|
| 1:10:51| He has asked to address this matter as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=4251)|
| 1:10:54| Name again for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=4254)|
| 1:10:55| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=4255)|
| 1:10:56| Dean Rice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=4256)|
| 1:10:57| And Mayor Burchett asked me to come down and just briefly tell you that this morning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=4257)|
| 1:11:03| his first act was to ask me to contact the Finance Department and payroll| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=4263)|
| 1:11:08| and ask them to put a suspension on the severance payments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=4268)|
| 1:11:12| so that that money will remain in the county pending a review by the law department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=4272)|
| 1:11:16| And upon recommendation of the law office, that will be acted upon in a permanent way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=4276)|
| 1:11:22| But as of right now, no monies are departing county coffers going to those severance payments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=4282)|
| 1:11:30| Mr. Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=4290)|
| 1:11:31| Mr. Chairman, I'd go ahead and like to ask the law department if they would in the future,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=4291)|
| 1:11:35| if we have time, well, for the September meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=4295)|
| 1:11:37| let's come up with a resolution that this does not happen again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=4297)|
| 1:11:41| Yes, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=4301)|
| 1:11:42| I provided you with a memo really to preclude this from happening in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=4302)|
| 1:11:47| You'll want to do two things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=4307)|
| 1:11:49| One, your Knox County Code Article 2, excuse me, Chapter 2, Article 10 is actually a personnel plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=4309)|
| 1:11:57| It's codified in the code, not in the charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=4317)|
| 1:11:59| So by way of an ordinance, you can preclude severance pay of this nature in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=4319)|
| 1:12:05| Likewise, as the personnel policy comes under the auspices of the executive branch,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=4325)|
| 1:12:11| specifically Mayor Burchett, you could, by resolution, ask the mayor to amend the personal plan as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=4331)|
| 1:12:18| In other words, the employee handbook.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=4338)|
| 1:12:20| So you've got two different vehicles by which you can accomplish this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=4340)|
| 1:12:23| One, amend your code, and two, amend your employee handbook.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=4343)|
| 1:12:26| Now, relative to the payments that have been, that tentatively have at least been extended,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=4346)|
| 1:12:31| I'm still researching that, and depending upon where the law lies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=4351)|
| 1:12:36| I'll then brief the commission as to whether or not those can, at least can be released,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=4356)|
| 1:12:41| or if by law they may not be released.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=4361)|
| 1:12:44| If you'll just get back with us, let us know if we need an ordinance or a resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=4364)|
| 1:12:47| Well, you'll want both.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=4367)|
| 1:12:50| I'll draft them both, and I'll likewise provide copies to the mayor's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=4370)|
| 1:12:54| Commissioner McKenzie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=4374)|
| 1:12:56| Yes, I guess I'm just trying to figure out what are the dangers in us going off doing several things that you may come back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=4376)|
| 1:13:05| and say, oh, well, you couldn't do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=4385)|
| 1:13:07| Are we putting ourselves at risk for a lawsuit, and we end up spending a whole bunch of additional funds by,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=4387)|
| 1:13:14| from what I hear, we've kind of captured those dollars for the time being.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=4394)|
| 1:13:21| I guess my bottom line, at this point, I'm trying to figure out what's going to be best for the county financially.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=4401)|
| 1:13:29| If we put your department at risk of having to defend lawsuits to the point you have to hire outside firms,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=4409)|
| 1:13:37| and we're dealing with this six, nine, you know, months or a year down the line, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=4417)|
| 1:13:43| and our answer is going to be there's nothing you can do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=4423)|
| 1:13:47| I mean, if we're, you know, 80%, 90% in the final analysis, we're not going to be able to do anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=4427)|
| 1:13:52| I know this makes great news for the press, but, you know, I'm not really concerned about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=4432)|
| 1:14:00| I'm concerned about if we're going to be spending this money unwisely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=4440)|
| 1:14:04| So if you could kind of weigh in, I know you've done some research, and you're, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=4444)|
| 1:14:09| or you're out there trying to find that one law that may have precedent, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=4449)|
| 1:14:14| and try to build a case from there, or do you have, you know, kind of good grounds for us to go forward?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=4454)|
| 1:14:19| And I'm fine with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=4459)|
| 1:14:21| But I want to hear something about do we have a chance to get this money back in the final analysis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=4461)|
| 1:14:25| or is this just going to be one of these things that are going to cost us a lot of time and wasted energy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=4465)|
| 1:14:31| Professor, are you talking about the monies currently that were promised to these employees?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=4471)|
| 1:14:35| I guess, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=4475)|
| 1:14:36| I'm talking about those funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=4476)|
| 1:14:37| Those funds are currently, as the Chief has said, they're frozen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=4477)|
| 1:14:40| So they have not been given.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=4480)|
| 1:14:42| So it wouldn't be a matter of having to sue someone to recoup, which is always difficult.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=4482)|
| 1:14:47| What we want to ensure is, and again, Tennessee code is silent, charter is silent, Tennessee policy is silent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=4487)|
| 1:14:54| and the courts haven't really weighed in on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=4494)|
| 1:14:58| whether or not you actually have the power and authority to give a severance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=4498)|
| 1:15:02| If you don't, the money is frozen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=4502)|
| 1:15:05| Generally, the only time you can give a severance payment under two circumstances,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=4505)|
| 1:15:09| one, it's permitted by law and either in statute or a home rule charter or code,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=4509)|
| 1:15:16| and two, there is a written contract and an agreement to that effect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=4516)|
| 1:15:22| That's where the only time the courts have been willing to permit a severance payment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=4522)|
| 1:15:28| Because a severance is giving employees money for work they did not perform.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=4528)|
| 1:15:32| That's how the court looks at a severance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=4532)|
| 1:15:34| Now, if you could demonstrate to a court or if you just look at your code and give it as plain meaning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=4534)|
| 1:15:38| it says code section 22.2 reads they can get a settlement or a severance up to three months| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=4538)|
| 1:15:44| and there's an employment contract, it's defensible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=4544)|
| 1:15:47| In the absence of both, the court gives it a jaundiced eye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=4547)|
| 1:15:51| But I don't want to just sit here and tell you today, tell them they're not getting it henceforth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=4551)|
| 1:15:57| Again, it's not a heavily litigated subject.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=4557)|
| 1:16:01| Both the municipal attorney's advisory service and the county advisory service both have struggled with this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=4561)|
| 1:16:09| because of the absence of case precedent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=4569)|
| 1:16:11| But I'm researching it and I'll give you an unflinching analysis of what I think the law is and what your options are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=4571)|
| 1:16:19| Mr. Chairman, may I say, Mr. Commissioner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=4579)|
| 1:16:22| the goal of freezing those funds is simply to avoid litigation in the future,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=4582)|
| 1:16:27| to let the law department have an opportunity window to examine that, to look at the case history| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=4587)|
| 1:16:33| and to come up with a recommendation so that there's not a need to go through the process of reaching out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=4593)|
| 1:16:39| and trying to get funds returned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=4599)|
| 1:16:42| That would certainly be expensive and require litigation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=4602)|
| 1:16:45| Mr. Chouse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=4605)|
| 1:16:47| Thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=4607)|
| 1:16:48| Mr. Jarrett, let me just ask you for my own information and to relate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=4608)|
| 1:16:54| explain this to constituents as best I can when asked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=4614)|
| 1:16:57| You're determining if 100 hours after the fact a chief executive of Knotts County gave a severance package| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=4617)|
| 1:17:04| and now 100 hours after the fact you're going to determine if the new chief executive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=4624)|
| 1:17:09| who apparently has a different opinion, can freeze that money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=4629)|
| 1:17:13| Am I correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=4633)|
| 1:17:14| Well, sir, what you have to realize is that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=4634)|
| 1:17:17| the mayor as part of the executive branch of government can only act within those powers granted to it by state statute| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=4637)|
| 1:17:25| or charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=4645)|
| 1:17:26| So regardless of who is sitting in that seat, if that person acts in an ultra vires, in other words,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=4646)|
| 1:17:32| in a manner which exceeds their power and authority, then that public money cannot be released.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=4652)|
| 1:17:39| So it's not a matter of there was a written contract and there was a code that permitted it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=4659)|
| 1:17:44| and we're just trying to breach it because we didn't like what the former mayor did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=4664)|
| 1:17:47| We have to make sure that the former mayor acted within the power and authority he has.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=4667)|
| 1:17:52| If the courts determine that he's exceeded that power, then the money is illegally given| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=4672)|
| 1:17:57| and then we'd have a duty to, as public officers, to ensure it's not given| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=4677)|
| 1:18:02| or the alternative, if it's already meted out, to recoup it or retract it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=4682)|
| 1:18:06| So it's just the bottom line we have to determine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=4686)|
| 1:18:09| Some courts have stated pretty plainly that severance pays are improper and inappropriate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=4689)|
| 1:18:17| and contrary to public policy because, again, you're paying employees for work they did not perform.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=4697)|
| 1:18:24| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=4704)|
| 1:18:25| And there appears to be somewhat of a co-mingling of funds here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=4705)|
| 1:18:29| May not be the right word, but severance being here it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=4709)|
| 1:18:33| This is your reward for your service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=4713)|
| 1:18:35| And also an accumulation of vacation time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=4715)|
| 1:18:38| Am I right on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=4718)|
| 1:18:39| In the business world, you take your vacation or you don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=4719)|
| 1:18:43| Next year you accumulate it for ten years and get a quarter of a million dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=4723)|
| 1:18:47| Is there sort of a mixing of wages here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=4727)|
| 1:18:51| Well, your code does permit certain vacation or at least sick leave to be paid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=4731)|
| 1:18:57| I'll be quite as honest with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=4737)|
| 1:18:58| I learned about this on Friday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=4738)|
| 1:19:00| I have never seen an agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=4740)|
| 1:19:02| I don't actually know the specifics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=4742)|
| 1:19:04| I don't even know how that formula was created.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=4744)|
| 1:19:07| I was never part of that conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=4747)|
| 1:19:09| I was never consulted upon it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=4749)|
| 1:19:11| So right now I'm trying to do the same exact thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=4751)|
| 1:19:14| I'm trying to parcel out what is actually an entitlement under our code and personnel policy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=4754)|
| 1:19:19| and what is just purely a severance package for which the employee did not earn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=4759)|
| 1:19:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=4765)|
| 1:19:26| It appears from the numbers given by the newspaper and on television and what we've seen that there are the big numbers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=4766)|
| 1:19:31| the severance, and then the number that's relatively smaller is accumulated vacation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=4771)|
| 1:19:36| Is that my accurate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=4776)|
| 1:19:37| Vacation and sick time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=4777)|
| 1:19:38| And so, yes, under the current policy, that money will probably be released.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=4778)|
| 1:19:44| May I address that question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=4784)|
| 1:19:46| Please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=4786)|
| 1:19:47| There's two separate issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=4787)|
| 1:19:49| The severance, which is what was apparently agreed to by the previous administration for these three employees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=4789)|
| 1:19:55| those are the funds that have been held.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=4795)|
| 1:19:59| The last paycheck that they receive and the accumulated annual leave that is per the human resources policy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=4799)|
| 1:20:07| and standard policy for county employees, that money is released| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=4807)|
| 1:20:12| and will be given to them as it would be to any employee who left service as part of that service agreement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=4812)|
| 1:20:19| under the policies that are currently set.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=4819)|
| 1:20:21| So the money that has not been released is what we would quote call severance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=4821)|
| 1:20:25| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=4825)|
| 1:20:26| Just that portion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=4826)|
| 1:20:28| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=4828)|
| 1:20:29| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=4829)|
| 1:20:30| Commissioner Burroughs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=4830)|
| 1:20:34| In the private sector, when a management person or position is terminated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=4834)|
| 1:20:40| is it common practice to give them a severance package when they leave?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=4840)|
| 1:20:46| I know that in some businesses it is and in some businesses it isn't, especially if you're in a management position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=4846)|
| 1:20:55| I'm also wondering if these people had been fired or laid off, would they be eligible for unemployment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=4855)|
| 1:21:06| Commissioner Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=4866)|
| 1:21:08| Yes, I just had a question or had a comment, and I think this has been covered,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=4868)|
| 1:21:11| but there's really two key questions right here that I think the law director is probably going to have to try to determine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=4871)|
| 1:21:17| He may not be able to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=4877)|
| 1:21:19| One, does the mayor, a mayor, any mayor, have the authority to negotiate such a deal as this, a severance package?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=4879)|
| 1:21:26| And then, two, was there any written agreement signed on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=4886)|
| 1:21:32| Because frequently when you do have a severance package, there's confidentiality issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=4892)|
| 1:21:37| where people can't make public statements, but we don't know either of those, do we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=4897)|
| 1:21:40| No, sir, I don't know at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=4900)|
| 1:21:42| You know, the first issue, that's my point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=4902)|
| 1:21:45| The research I've located so far is that courts are very uneasy about these kind of severance packages,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=4905)|
| 1:21:53| but I can't tell you at this point the Tennessee Supreme Court says they're illegal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=4913)|
| 1:21:56| I'm just saying they're questioned by the court and they're not favored by the court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=4916)|
| 1:22:01| In terms of whether or not there's any kind of written agreement, I have no idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=4921)|
| 1:22:03| I'm requesting that, and I'd like to see whether or not, I need to learn if there is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=4923)|
| 1:22:07| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=4927)|
| 1:22:15| Hey, Mr. Chair, this is a policy question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=4935)|
| 1:22:17| Francis, could you come forward?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=4937)|
| 1:22:21| And my question is, you know, everyone could come from their own, you know, life experiences.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=4941)|
| 1:22:29| Is there a cap?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=4949)|
| 1:22:31| This is kind of following up on what Commissioner Shouse was asking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=4951)|
| 1:22:35| Is there a cap on accrued vacation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=4955)|
| 1:22:38| Yes, there are actually three caps based upon your length of service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=4958)|
| 1:22:43| And they are?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=4963)|
| 1:22:44| I can only quote the middle one, which is the one that I'm in, is 312 hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=4964)|
| 1:22:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=4969)|
| 1:22:50| And then there's one with lesser hours and one with greater hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=4970)|
| 1:22:54| And that kicks in, the latter cap kicks in, I guess, after.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=4974)|
| 1:23:00| After 20 years of service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=4980)|
| 1:23:01| After 20 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=4981)|
| 1:23:02| Okay, so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=4982)|
| 1:23:05| And we've been consistent with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=4985)|
| 1:23:06| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=4986)|
| 1:23:08| All right, that's my point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=4988)|
| 1:23:10| Mr. Wallaby.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=4990)|
| 1:23:12| Yeah, Mr. Commissioner Brewer's question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=4992)|
| 1:23:16| I work in the private sector.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=4996)|
| 1:23:18| If somebody resigns, you don't get a severance package.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=4998)|
| 1:23:22| It does not work in any corporation, in any business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=5002)|
| 1:23:26| Now, if there's a parting of ways or whatever, then, yes, there is some severances,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=5006)|
| 1:23:32| but it depends on the company and their policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=5012)|
| 1:23:35| But I've never heard of this in county government or even in the private sector.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=5015)|
| 1:23:40| If somebody resigns, they get a severance package.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=5020)|
| 1:23:42| And the citizens of this county, I've got I don't know how many phone calls and e-mails this weekend over this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=5022)|
| 1:23:50| They're outraged that this would happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=5030)|
| 1:23:53| And we need to at least put steps in that we don't, that could block this from happening in the future| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=5033)|
| 1:24:00| so that we're not setting a precedent that outgoing mayors can raid the coffers of the new coming mayor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=5040)|
| 1:24:07| and putting them behind the eight ball.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=5047)|
| 1:24:09| Mr. Burwells.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=5049)|
| 1:24:14| No, I've never known anyone to resign from a job and be offered a severance package,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=5054)|
| 1:24:17| but I do know a lot of people who have been fired from positions who are given a severance package on their way out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=5057)|
| 1:24:23| Joe, if these people had been fired, would they be eligible for unemployment or not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=5063)|
| 1:24:29| They can apply for unemployment whether or not the Unemployment Commission would honor it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=5069)|
| 1:24:34| It would be depending on the circumstances, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=5074)|
| 1:24:37| But in terms of merely being entitled to a severance because you're terminated normally,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=5077)|
| 1:24:43| especially in the public sector, you have that two-tier requirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=5083)|
| 1:24:46| One, it's in your code, and two, there's a written agreement to that effect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=5086)|
| 1:24:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=5090)|
| 1:24:51| I guess part of the thing I'm struggling with here is I don't think it was, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=5091)|
| 1:24:59| I'm certainly not in the close loop of anything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=5099)|
| 1:25:04| but I do know that there were some people that our new mayor was not interested in keeping on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=5104)|
| 1:25:10| and if they had not resigned, they probably would have been asked to leave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=5110)|
| 1:25:17| So I feel like, and I also think that, you know, we need to watch our bottom line,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=5117)|
| 1:25:23| we need to watch our dollars and cents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=5123)|
| 1:25:25| but if we want to attract and retain the best and the brightest for government service,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=5125)|
| 1:25:30| then we do need to treat those employees with the same respect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=5130)|
| 1:25:35| and consideration that they would get in the private sector.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=5135)|
| 1:25:40| So I guess that's, I don't agree with the severance for resignation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=5140)|
| 1:25:43| but if people were asked to resign or it had been made clear to them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=5143)|
| 1:25:49| that there was not a place for them in the new administration,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=5149)|
| 1:25:53| and considering for some of them the years of service that they have offered to the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=5153)|
| 1:26:01| I don't think a severance is completely out of order if they've been asked to leave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=5161)|
| 1:26:06| Now, if they're resigning out of their own free will because they don't want to do the job anymore,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=5166)|
| 1:26:10| that's a different story.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=5170)|
| 1:26:13| Mr. Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=5173)|
| 1:26:15| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=5175)|
| 1:26:16| You know, Amy, I think about what you're saying, too, and I hear it both ways,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=5176)|
| 1:26:19| but, you know, what we have to keep in mind is if these employees have been there for 20 years or whatever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=5179)|
| 1:26:25| you know, they're walking away with quite a bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=5185)|
| 1:26:27| And to give them more is, you know, I just don't agree with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=5187)|
| 1:26:31| But I want to think about and remember two things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=5191)|
| 1:26:34| You know, we were all sworn in this morning and they were packed all the way to the rafters today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=5194)|
| 1:26:39| And that money that these severance packages were the people out in the audience, our taxpayers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=5199)|
| 1:26:45| that's taxpayers' money that's paying this severance pay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=5205)|
| 1:26:49| But more importantly, too, those people didn't earn that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=5209)|
| 1:26:52| They didn't earn this extra bonus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=5212)|
| 1:26:54| Yes, they deserve and they have earned their vacation time, comp time, whatever, that they have built up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=5214)|
| 1:27:00| I have no problem with them getting that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=5220)|
| 1:27:02| But for you to hand me three months of extra salary for stuff that I didn't do, I didn't earn that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=5222)|
| 1:27:07| I wouldn't take that money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901special?start=5227)|
