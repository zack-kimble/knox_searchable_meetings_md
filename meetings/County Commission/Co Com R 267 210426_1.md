| 2:37:17| Madam Clerk, let's start all over, shall we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=9437)|

| 2:37:43| are deemed to be in furtherance of the public purposes of the Board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=9463)|

| 2:38:16| This is one of those you don't want to go first, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=9496)|
| 2:38:20| So, I guess I'll go first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=9500)|
| 2:38:25| Of course, you all know how I feel about this pilot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=9505)|
| 2:38:28| Some of the things that really concerns me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=9508)|
| 2:38:31| is that I've talked to some hotel people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=9511)|
| 2:38:38| Things are coming back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=9518)|
| 2:38:39| Hotels are coming back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=9519)|
| 2:38:42| If we don't do the hotel agreeable to that pilot or whatever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=9522)|
| 2:38:47| we're going to lose 100 jobs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=9527)|
| 2:38:50| according to B&A, a $3.7 million payroll,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=9530)|
| 2:38:56| and over a million dollars local and room tax lost every year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=9536)|
| 2:39:02| That's their numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=9542)|
| 2:39:06| The offer was a no-strings-attached offer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=9546)|
| 2:39:09| but now we're finding out that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=9549)|
| 2:39:16| they're now wanting a pilot for how many years?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=9556)|
| 2:39:22| We'll soon find out here in just a few minutes, I'm sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=9562)|
| 2:39:26| They're getting a development fee of $760,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=9566)|
| 2:39:31| They're going to get a historic tax credit of over $1,604,324.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=9571)|
| 2:39:41| Mr. Whitehead told me that we can figure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=9581)|
| 2:39:45| for every million of dollars on commercial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=9585)|
| 2:39:47| $8,500 times one million is what the tax rolls will come out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=9587)|
| 2:39:54| I think it's undervalued.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=9594)|
| 2:39:57| The email that we got that showed the appraisal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=9597)|
| 2:40:00| was either $8.1 or $7.9 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=9600)|
| 2:40:05| They're willing to pay $6.1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=9605)|
| 2:40:12| Let's say the value of the A.J. building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=9612)|
| 2:40:14| when it's all said and done, is going to be, let's double it, $16 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=9614)|
| 2:40:18| You take $8,500 times 16, that's $136,000 a year in taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=9618)|
| 2:40:25| That's Knox County taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=9625)|
| 2:40:27| That's not city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=9627)|
| 2:40:28| I'm talking city, I'm not talking county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=9628)|
| 2:40:32| The Verizon revenue that's on top of that building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=9632)|
| 2:40:36| I'm sure that contract will go with the new owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=9636)|
| 2:40:41| Next year, it's to be at $124,000 a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=9641)|
| 2:40:48| In 2035, it's $158,000 a year for that Verizon contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=9648)|
| 2:40:54| We're wanting a pilot, and they're going to get an average,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=9654)|
| 2:40:58| I don't know what the average is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=9658)|
| 2:41:00| $140,000 a year for the next somewhat years in the taxes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=9660)|
| 2:41:04| and even at $16 million appraisals, $136,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=9664)|
| 2:41:08| Verizon's going to pay the taxes on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=9668)|
| 2:41:12| This is taxpayers' money on this one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=9672)|
| 2:41:16| and I'm going to watch after the taxpayers on this one right here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=9676)|
| 2:41:22| According to the report, with a pilot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=9682)|
| 2:41:26| the developer's going to make 12.3% profit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=9686)|
| 2:41:30| Without the pilot, the developer's going to make 9.9% profit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=9690)|
| 2:41:35| Most developers, when I was in business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=9695)|
| 2:41:39| with my company for 38 and a half years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=9699)|
| 2:41:43| we had contracts with the big guys,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=9703)|
| 2:41:46| the Alcoa's, the Denso's, the TVA's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=9706)|
| 2:41:50| 9.9% profit would have been awesome,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=9710)|
| 2:41:53| but it was less than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=9713)|
| 2:41:55| A couple of developers I talked to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=9715)|
| 2:41:57| 9.9 is a good return on developers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=9717)|
| 2:42:02| For a lot of reasons, I don't think this is a wise decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=9722)|
| 2:42:07| The A.J. building was put up to be sold| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=9727)|
| 2:42:10| to get back on the tax rolls, and that's what needs to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=9730)|
| 2:42:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=9734)|
| 2:42:16| Would you like to address commission, sir,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=9736)|
| 2:42:18| if you would state your name and address for the record?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=9738)|
| 2:42:20| Yeah, Phillip Welker, 104 Clifftop Drive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=9740)|
| 2:42:22| Hendersonville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=9742)|
| 2:42:24| A lot to pick apart there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=9744)|
| 2:42:26| I think these projects are a hit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=9746)|
| 2:42:30| These projects are inherently very expensive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=9750)|
| 2:42:32| I think the A.J. building is going to take| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=9752)|
| 2:42:34| some 34 odd million dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=9754)|
| 2:42:36| The RFP we put in four years ago now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=9756)|
| 2:42:39| had a pilot incentive modeled into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=9759)|
| 2:42:42| That was what we represented when we went into this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=9762)|
| 2:42:44| which is why in the RFP process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=9764)|
| 2:42:46| we estimate how much tax revenue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=9766)|
| 2:42:48| comes back to the county from hotel-motel tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=9768)|
| 2:42:50| We didn't include property tax,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=9770)|
| 2:42:51| because that was the question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=9771)|
| 2:42:53| that we were going to seek a pilot for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=9773)|
| 2:42:55| It's just a function,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=9775)|
| 2:42:57| I think Mark Mamentoff pointed out last meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=9777)|
| 2:42:59| that there was 25 pilots, I think, for downtown Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=9779)|
| 2:43:02| The pilot has always been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=9782)|
| 2:43:04| one of those necessary evils that it takes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=9784)|
| 2:43:06| to restore Knoxville to what's happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=9786)|
| 2:43:09| I think the reason why we brought this project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=9789)|
| 2:43:12| the way it is today, we're proposing it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=9792)|
| 2:43:14| is the hotel market is starting to come back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=9794)|
| 2:43:16| We own a lot of hotels, but it's not there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=9796)|
| 2:43:19| The financing market's always the last to lag.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=9799)|
| 2:43:21| I think by the time we get this project completed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=9801)|
| 2:43:23| then that would be a much better environment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=9803)|
| 2:43:25| to convert it to a hotel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=9805)|
| 2:43:26| rather than let the building sit there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=9806)|
| 2:43:28| and languish for however much time it takes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=9808)|
| 2:43:30| to get the financing market back in form| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=9810)|
| 2:43:32| for the hotel to be built.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=9812)|
| 2:43:33| Our ultimate goal is to get it to a hotel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=9813)|
| 2:43:35| is to get those hotel-motel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=9815)|
| 2:43:36| and all those sales tax revenues back to the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=9816)|
| 2:43:38| but this is just an intermediary step| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=9818)|
| 2:43:42| in order to address the times we're in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=9822)|
| 2:43:48| Any other specific point you made that I can address?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=9828)|
| 2:43:53| Well, I have a few comments on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=9833)|
| 2:43:55| I don't see any of the lights on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=9835)|
| 2:43:56| so I'm going to jump in since I don't have a light.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=9836)|
| 2:44:00| I think it concerns me that here we are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=9840)|
| 2:44:05| so long through this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=9845)|
| 2:44:07| We're potentially pulling the rug out from underneath| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=9847)|
| 2:44:10| really the people of Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=9850)|
| 2:44:13| and certainly the people of downtown Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=9853)|
| 2:44:16| at the zero hour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=9856)|
| 2:44:17| I mean, this process started,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=9857)|
| 2:44:22| this idea started in 2016.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=9862)|
| 2:44:24| This RFP was awarded to BNA in 2017.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=9864)|
| 2:44:28| The sales agreement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=9868)|
| 2:44:30| which I think a lot of commissioners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=9870)|
| 2:44:31| are still hung up on the sales price,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=9871)|
| 2:44:33| but the agreement that was approved by commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=9873)|
| 2:44:36| was last March in 2020, a year ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=9876)|
| 2:44:39| right at the height of the pandemic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=9879)|
| 2:44:42| The global pandemic changed every variable of business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=9882)|
| 2:44:46| certainly the hotel business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=9886)|
| 2:44:47| certainly the development business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=9887)|
| 2:44:49| certainly the cost of goods and materials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=9889)|
| 2:44:53| It is an unbelievably different market| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=9893)|
| 2:44:55| and it is going to take years and years and years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=9895)|
| 2:44:58| to even come back to even close to the same levels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=9898)|
| 2:45:00| And then we approved a development agreement in December| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=9900)|
| 2:45:03| and here we are at the last part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=9903)|
| 2:45:06| And I heard a lot of commissioners say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=9906)|
| 2:45:08| well, the third party agreement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=9908)|
| 2:45:10| got to have the third party agreement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=9910)|
| 2:45:11| got to have that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=9911)|
| 2:45:12| That came back, not as 20 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=9912)|
| 2:45:14| not as 25 years, not as 30 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=9914)|
| 2:45:17| all the things that pilots are demonized for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=9917)|
| 2:45:19| but it's 12 years, a very reasonable pilot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=9919)|
| 2:45:22| given all the other development of downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=9922)|
| 2:45:24| And I find it sort of ironic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=9924)|
| 2:45:26| that the same development tool being scrutinized| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=9926)|
| 2:45:29| at the zero hour here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=9929)|
| 2:45:30| is the same one being asked for in places like Farragut,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=9930)|
| 2:45:34| where they're glad to use this tool| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=9934)|
| 2:45:36| that does not cost the taxpayers anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=9936)|
| 2:45:39| The AJ building does not generate a tax dollar today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=9939)|
| 2:45:43| It has not for over 20 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=9943)|
| 2:45:45| And it has sat vacant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=9945)|
| 2:45:46| And if we do not move forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=9946)|
| 2:45:48| it is going to sit vacant for a long, long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=9948)|
| 2:45:52| And there's some hopes that you might get more,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=9952)|
| 2:45:55| but what if you get a whole bunch less?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=9955)|
| 2:45:57| We have a partner that has been patient.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=9957)|
| 2:45:59| I asked last week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=9959)|
| 2:46:00| is there anything that BNA has not done along this process?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=9960)|
| 2:46:03| And the answer is no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=9963)|
| 2:46:04| I tell you what, if I was BNA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=9964)|
| 2:46:06| I'd have pulled out a long time ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=9966)|
| 2:46:07| and said you can take your big old empty building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=9967)|
| 2:46:10| and enjoy your zero tax revenue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=9970)|
| 2:46:12| because I don't want the hassle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=9972)|
| 2:46:14| But they've stuck with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=9974)|
| 2:46:15| And if we are not people of our word, who are we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=9975)|

| 2:46:33| and getting the AJ building back on the tax rolls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=9993)|

| 2:47:08| And again, as a commissioner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=10028)|
| 2:47:10| I think we have a fiduciary responsibility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=10030)|

| 2:57:09| Hi, my name is Thomas Ruggles. I live here in Knox County. Today, I'm here to speak to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=10629)|
| 2:57:16| you all about mistakes. I think we can all agree here that no one is perfect. And as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=10636)|
| 2:57:24| a result of none of us being perfect, that means we all make mistakes. In fact, it are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=10644)|
| 2:57:30| mistakes that we often learn from that help us build a better version of ourselves. Mistakes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=10650)|
| 2:57:42| the one of the reasons that so many of us, it's one of the reasons we go to church every| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=10662)|
| 2:57:47| Sunday to repent, to say we're sorry for the mistakes that we've made. And also to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=10667)|
| 2:57:58| say that we are not perfect, but we're doing the best that we can. And Anthony Thompson,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=10678)|
| 2:58:03| Jr., he was never given that opportunity. He was never given a chance to reflect and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=10683)|
| 2:58:09| just see how serious of a mistake he had made. He was never given the opportunity to say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=10689)|
| 2:58:15| he was sorry for the mistake that he made. And as a matter of fact, he wasn't even allowed to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=10695)|
| 2:58:22| finish the very last sentence that he started speaking. We all heard him, his last words,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=10702)|
| 2:58:29| wait, wait, wait. But what was he going to say next? We heard him frantic. Wait, wait, wait.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=10709)|
| 2:58:38| I'm sorry. Wait, wait, wait. I'm scared. Wait, wait, wait. I wasn't going to hurt anybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=10718)|
| 2:58:46| But the fact of the matter is, we will never know what Anthony was going to say. Because before he| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=10726)|
| 2:58:52| could get more than three words out of his mouth, the police had already escalated the situation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=10732)|
| 2:58:58| that got all too real, all too quick. And seconds later, he was lying on the ground, bleeding out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=10738)|
| 2:59:07| And since then, I've been saddened to see so many members of our community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=10747)|
| 2:59:12| including elected officials, basically shrugging their shoulders at the killing of Anthony Thompson| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=10752)|
| 2:59:19| and saying, well, he shouldn't have had a gun in school. I think we can all agree that no one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=10759)|
| 2:59:24| should have a gun in school. We have a problem of mass shootings in this country. We all know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=10764)|
| 2:59:31| But we also know Anthony Thompson, he was no school shooter. He was scared. He was a 17-year-old| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=10771)|
| 2:59:38| boy that was scared because a grown man texted him that day and threatened to beat him up after| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=10778)|
| 2:59:45| school, as he had done at times in the past. So that's why he had a gun that day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=10785)|
| 2:59:51| because he was scared. That's why he was hiding in the bathroom that day, because he was scared.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=10791)|
| 2:59:59| And to kill Anthony Thompson was not the only option. It was not the cops or Anthony Thompson,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=10799)|
| 3:00:05| one or the other. There were options. Why did no one take the time to call into the bathroom and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=10805)|
| 3:00:11| say, hey, Anthony, what's going on? Let's talk this out. Give him a chance to explain himself| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=10811)|
| 3:00:18| and see why he's hiding in the bathroom. Why did the cops not give him a chance to finish| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=10818)|
| 3:00:25| speaking more than three words before escalating the situation? Had they waited,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=10825)|
| 3:00:30| they would have understood that he wasn't there to hurt anybody, and he'd still be standing with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=10830)|
| 3:00:35| us today, because he didn't want to shoot any officers. He didn't want to shoot anybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=10835)|
| 3:00:42| He just wanted to make it home from school without getting his ass beat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=10842)|
| 3:00:47| So no, killing him was not the only option. There were plenty of other options, and I'm tired of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=10847)|
| 3:00:53| people saying that was the only option. And so we're here today to say that we will not stand down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=10853)|
| 3:01:02| We will not be quiet until there is justice for Anthony Thompson Jr., and until we see change,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=10862)|
| 3:01:08| and I mean real change, real policy change, to make sure this cannot happen to another child| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=10868)|
| 3:01:15| in our county, because these children deserve to be able to go to school and feel safe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=10875)|

| 3:09:40| at our peaceful protest, we had KPD militarized. We had armored vehicles. We had officers in white| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=11380)|

| 3:11:04| and a part of the solution. Because when I've reached out to members of the committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=11464)|

| 3:11:28| in the East Knoxville community, for years now. And we've seen nothing change. And part of that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=11488)|
| 3:11:34| is because these meetings aren't accessible. I know of these meetings because I'm in groups| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=11494)|

| 3:11:59| want to tell us it's on us for not showing up and advocating for ourselves. We'll make it easier| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210426?start=11519)|
