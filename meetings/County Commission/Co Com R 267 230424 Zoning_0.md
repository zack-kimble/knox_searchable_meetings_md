| 0:05:35| They fly in, they rent a car, they stay for their two or three months, or six months,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424-zoning?start=335.0)|

| 0:29:32| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424-zoning?start=1772.0)|
| 0:29:34| How are you going to access that property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424-zoning?start=1774.0)|
| 0:29:36| We're being rezoned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424-zoning?start=1776.0)|
| 0:29:38| We're taking that little piece of A and putting it into RB because we needed to re-subdivide this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424-zoning?start=1778.0)|
| 0:29:43| Mr. Ray wanted to buy a little piece of property from his brother-in-law who owns the property behind him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424-zoning?start=1783.0)|
| 0:29:48| So he was zoned RB, but the property behind him is zoned A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424-zoning?start=1788.0)|
| 0:29:52| So we had to get it all into RB to be able to do a re-sub.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424-zoning?start=1792.0)|
| 0:29:55| Okay, so they're going to build and use one driveway for both houses?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424-zoning?start=1795.0)|
| 0:29:58| Right, there's a house there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424-zoning?start=1798.0)|
| 0:30:00| They're not going to build a house or anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424-zoning?start=1800.0)|
| 0:30:02| There's a house there already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424-zoning?start=1802.0)|
| 0:30:04| And he just wanted to add on to the back of his property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424-zoning?start=1804.0)|
| 0:30:06| So since the back of it was in A and it requires one acre lots, he had to rezone it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424-zoning?start=1806.0)|
| 0:30:10| Gotcha.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424-zoning?start=1810.0)|
| 0:30:12| And this is like a third of an acre?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424-zoning?start=1812.0)|

| 0:35:39| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424-zoning?start=2139.0)|
| 0:35:41| I sent you an email today for that request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424-zoning?start=2141.0)|
| 0:35:44| I think this is the second time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424-zoning?start=2144.0)|
| 0:35:46| Do we need to suspend the rules, Law Director, to do this, or are we okay with it since I'm requesting it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424-zoning?start=2146.0)|
| 0:35:52| The deferral?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424-zoning?start=2152.0)|
| 0:35:54| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424-zoning?start=2154.0)|
| 0:35:56| If you're requesting it, it doesn't require suspension of the rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424-zoning?start=2156.0)|
| 0:35:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424-zoning?start=2158.0)|
| 0:36:00| You can do it yourself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424-zoning?start=2160.0)|
| 0:36:02| I'll make a motion to rehear at the May 22nd meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424-zoning?start=2162.0)|
| 0:36:07| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424-zoning?start=2167.0)|
| 0:36:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424-zoning?start=2169.0)|
| 0:36:11| Motion to defer to our May zoning meeting by Commissioner Daley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424-zoning?start=2171.0)|
| 0:36:15| With a second by Commissioner Beeler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424-zoning?start=2175.0)|
| 0:36:19| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424-zoning?start=2179.0)|
| 0:36:30| Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424-zoning?start=2190.0)|
| 0:36:32| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424-zoning?start=2192.0)|
| 0:36:34| So an applicant can keep deferring and deferring and deferring,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424-zoning?start=2194.0)|
| 0:36:39| but if he came here under our rules, he'd get one deferral,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424-zoning?start=2199.0)|
| 0:36:43| and then the second time, if he wanted to defer it, it would be withdrawn at that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424-zoning?start=2203.0)|
| 0:36:50| But if he comes to a commissioner, the commissioner can keep going on and on and on and on and on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424-zoning?start=2210.0)|
| 0:36:56| Is that correct, Mr. Law Director?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424-zoning?start=2216.0)|
| 0:36:58| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424-zoning?start=2218.0)|
| 0:36:59| What our rules say is if an applicant has a right to a single deferral,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424-zoning?start=2219.0)|
| 0:37:05| okay, so if he's here the first time or she and says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424-zoning?start=2225.0)|
| 0:37:09| I'd like a deferral, they have a right to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424-zoning?start=2229.0)|
| 0:37:11| The second time, they can't do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424-zoning?start=2231.0)|
| 0:37:13| But commission controls its own agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424-zoning?start=2233.0)|
| 0:37:16| and the commission can defer as many matters or a matter as many times as it likes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424-zoning?start=2236.0)|
| 0:37:22| And as I recall, if I'm not mistaken, this was deferred by the commission the first time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424-zoning?start=2242.0)|
| 0:37:28| I believe it has been because this is the one, not getting in too deep,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424-zoning?start=2248.0)|
| 0:37:33| there's an issue with the title insurance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424-zoning?start=2253.0)|
| 0:37:36| and that title has to be solved before the zoning needs to be taken place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424-zoning?start=2256.0)|
| 0:37:42| And I apologize that we have to keep doing that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424-zoning?start=2262.0)|
| 0:37:45| but if we knew if we could prod the title company to come on, it would be better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424-zoning?start=2265.0)|
| 0:37:53| I understand, absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424-zoning?start=2273.0)|
| 0:37:54| Could we have, there would have been no problem procedure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424-zoning?start=2274.0)|
| 0:37:58| if we'd done that at the beginning of the zoning session, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424-zoning?start=2278.0)|
| 0:38:01| Or during setting the agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424-zoning?start=2281.0)|
| 0:38:04| Yeah, we could have done the same agenda, but I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424-zoning?start=2284.0)|
| 0:38:07| I should have brought that forward at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424-zoning?start=2287.0)|
| 0:38:09| I wasn't paying attention, so slap me on the hand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424-zoning?start=2289.0)|
| 0:38:15| Okay, motion is to defer to our May zoning meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424-zoning?start=2295.0)|
| 0:38:20| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424-zoning?start=2300.0)|
| 0:38:22| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424-zoning?start=2302.0)|
| 0:38:23| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424-zoning?start=2303.0)|
| 0:38:25| That motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424-zoning?start=2305.0)|
| 0:38:27| Commissioners, there was a miscommunication.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424-zoning?start=2307.0)|
| 0:38:30| Mr. Calvin DeBrill had signed up last week to speak to our non-agenda items for this week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424-zoning?start=2310.0)|
| 0:38:36| so he's going to briefly address commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424-zoning?start=2316.0)|
| 0:38:42| Calvin DeBrill, 5201 Holston Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424-zoning?start=2322.0)|
| 0:38:46| Commissioners, you had a question put before you not too long ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424-zoning?start=2326.0)|
| 0:38:51| about 18-year-olds working for the Sheriff's Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424-zoning?start=2331.0)|
| 0:38:59| February 5th, Mrs. Lisa Edward died at the hands of Knoxville Police Department officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424-zoning?start=2339.0)|

| 0:39:13| But something was said in the middle of her dying in the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424-zoning?start=2353.0)|
| 0:39:24| Sergeant Brandon Warlow, KPD officer, told Mrs. Edwards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424-zoning?start=2364.0)|
| 0:39:32| this is all an act.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424-zoning?start=2372.0)|
| 0:39:35| When you get out to the jail, you better know what you're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424-zoning?start=2375.0)|
| 0:39:42| You better not play this stunt because they don't play around out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424-zoning?start=2382.0)|
| 0:39:49| Now, Sheriff Spangler, Chief Purvis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424-zoning?start=2389.0)|
| 0:39:56| they are trying to fill gaps as far as not having enough officers out there working.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424-zoning?start=2396.0)|
| 0:40:05| The reason why they have a shortage is because,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424-zoning?start=2405.0)|
| 0:40:10| I hate to say my own personal experience,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424-zoning?start=2410.0)|
| 0:40:14| with almost two years of solitary confinement in that jail,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424-zoning?start=2414.0)|
| 0:40:18| what happens when somebody has an issue like Mrs. Edwards had?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424-zoning?start=2418.0)|
| 0:40:26| Here come the fists. Here come the feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424-zoning?start=2426.0)|
| 0:40:30| You'll get beat, thrown in the cell,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424-zoning?start=2430.0)|
| 0:40:34| and they will cut off all communications to the outside world for 30, 60 days until you heal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424-zoning?start=2434.0)|
| 0:40:42| But in the meantime, your family's out there wondering,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424-zoning?start=2442.0)|
| 0:40:46| well, why can't I see him?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424-zoning?start=2446.0)|
| 0:40:48| Well, he was being disruptive while she was being disruptive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424-zoning?start=2448.0)|
| 0:40:52| That's the reason you have a staffing shortage out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424-zoning?start=2452.0)|
| 0:40:57| I think you asked Chief Purvis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424-zoning?start=2457.0)|
| 0:41:00| well, what's the reason why people keep leaving?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424-zoning?start=2460.0)|
| 0:41:03| Because when you look at the inhumane treatment of people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424-zoning?start=2463.0)|
| 0:41:08| in a confined area such as that county jail out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424-zoning?start=2468.0)|
| 0:41:13| where you have people sleeping in the floor right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424-zoning?start=2473.0)|
| 0:41:17| out there in cells for two men.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424-zoning?start=2477.0)|
| 0:41:21| There's three men in it with a tolerance that don't flush.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424-zoning?start=2481.0)|
| 0:41:25| This is not anything that I'm making it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424-zoning?start=2485.0)|
| 0:41:29| I've seen it with my own eyes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424-zoning?start=2489.0)|
| 0:41:30| I've had to live, survive through it, and still fighting it today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424-zoning?start=2490.0)|
| 0:41:35| So Sheriff Spangler's not telling you the truth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424-zoning?start=2495.0)|
| 0:41:39| Chief Purvis is not telling you the truth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424-zoning?start=2499.0)|
| 0:41:42| about why they have a staffing problem out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424-zoning?start=2502.0)|
| 0:41:46| Because people with a heart, any kind of humanity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424-zoning?start=2506.0)|
| 0:41:51| imagine if they'll do that to a woman in the street at the hospital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424-zoning?start=2511.0)|

| 0:42:06| Think about what you're doing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424-zoning?start=2526.0)|
| 0:42:09| putting 18-year-old kids out there in that jail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424-zoning?start=2529.0)|

| 0:42:58| We don't have zoning in Campbell County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424-zoning?start=2578.0)|

| 0:43:05| But not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424-zoning?start=2585.0)|
