| 2:13:42| how to be good supervisors and have the training,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=8022)|
| 2:13:45| resources and support they need to deal with disciplinary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=8025)|
| 2:13:48| concerns effectively and fairly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=8028)|
| 2:13:50| And that's with fire. That's with police.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=8030)|
| 2:13:52| And that's with general government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=8032)|
| 2:13:55| Better management is going to make us a better, well-run| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=8035)|
| 2:13:57| city and address a lot of concerns, both internal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=8037)|
| 2:14:00| and external for how we deal with our customers, the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=8040)|
| 2:14:04| The ultimate check on the potential for abuse,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=8044)|
| 2:14:07| regardless of functional structure, is the civil service| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=8047)|
| 2:14:09| merit board and the protections afforded in the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=8049)|
| 2:14:12| charter, all of which remain fully intact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=8052)|
| 2:14:16| I'm just going to repeat that again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=8056)|
| 2:14:17| The protections afforded in the city charter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=8057)|
| 2:14:19| will remain fully intact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=8059)|
| 2:14:21| This is also why it's critical that we preserve the integrity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=8061)|
| 2:14:24| of the civil service protection by separating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=8064)|
| 2:14:26| these functions so that we don't have the proverbial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=8066)|
| 2:14:29| fox guarding the henhouse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=8069)|
| 2:14:32| Finally, we've heard concerns that two people won't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=8072)|
| 2:14:34| have the bandwidth to do all we want the HR office to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=8074)|
| 2:14:38| I want to emphasize that we already have folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=8078)|
| 2:14:41| who are supporting HR functions in multiple departments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=8081)|
| 2:14:43| across the city, Christine Fitzgerald and employee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=8083)|
| 2:14:46| benefits folks in KPD and fire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=8086)|
| 2:14:49| And we will be able to make this transition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=8089)|
| 2:14:52| We will not be requiring current employees of the civil| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=8092)|
| 2:14:54| service department to involuntarily transfer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=8094)|
| 2:14:57| into the new HR department or to reapply for their jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=8097)|
| 2:15:00| Indeed, that would be illegal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=8100)|
| 2:15:04| I recognize fully that change is never easy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=8104)|
| 2:15:06| However, I feel responsibility to move this long held| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=8106)|
| 2:15:09| conversation forward to action to help| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=8109)|
| 2:15:11| ensure that the city remains a model employer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=8111)|
| 2:15:14| reflecting 21st century best practices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=8114)|
| 2:15:17| We're happy to answer any questions and I really hope| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=8117)|
| 2:15:19| you'll support this important step.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=8119)|
| 2:15:23| So now, Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=8123)|
| 2:15:24| Swanson, we would you would remind| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=8124)|
| 2:15:27| me why we need to have an amendment on this, because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=8127)|
| 2:15:30| this was originally brought to council back in early April.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=8130)|
| 2:15:33| So I'll let you speak to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=8133)|
| 2:15:36| Yes, Mayor. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=8136)|
| 2:15:37| I just wanted to bring to your attention| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=8137)|
| 2:15:40| technical procedural matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=8140)|
| 2:15:42| When this matter was postponed before, it was the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=8142)|
| 2:15:45| ordinance that was in its original form.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=8145)|
| 2:15:49| That you have been supplied with since then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=8149)|
| 2:15:50| The one that's in your back has been amended| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=8150)|
| 2:15:53| following our various listening sessions that we've had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=8153)|
| 2:15:56| with all the various groups.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=8156)|
| 2:15:58| And we listened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=8158)|
| 2:16:00| Were made and tried to make some amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=8160)|
| 2:16:03| We have sent you a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=8163)|
| 2:16:06| email advising you about each of those amendments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=8166)|
| 2:16:09| that we made to a red line version.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=8169)|
| 2:16:11| So you'll see what they are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=8171)|
| 2:16:13| So I think all of council is apprised| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=8173)|
| 2:16:16| the changes that have been made since last this ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=8176)|
| 2:16:19| was before you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=8179)|
| 2:16:20| And so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=8180)|
| 2:16:22| But in order for you to consider the ordinance as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=8182)|
| 2:16:24| it has been amended to address those concerns,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=8184)|
| 2:16:27| it's going to be necessary first for someone to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=8187)|
| 2:16:30| make a motion to amend to consider| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=8190)|
| 2:16:32| that version of the ordinance rather than the original| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=8192)|
| 2:16:35| version of the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=8195)|
| 2:16:36| We'll need a second for that motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=8196)|
| 2:16:38| And then if you adopt the motion to amend,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=8198)|
| 2:16:41| then you can have your discussion with regard to the amended| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=8201)|
| 2:16:44| version of the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=8204)|
| 2:16:46| Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Swanson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=8206)|

| 2:16:49| Since I made the original motion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=8209)|
| 2:16:52| I will make the motion that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=8212)|
| 2:16:54| vote on to amend| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=8214)|

| 2:17:06| Is there a second to her amendment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=8226)|
| 2:17:08| Second. Councilwoman Ryder seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=8228)|
| 2:17:10| So.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=8230)|
| 2:17:11| So what you're voting on is basically that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=8231)|
| 2:17:14| you're going to amend it. So you're voting on what's actually in your packet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=8234)|
| 2:17:17| today with all the red line changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=8237)|
| 2:17:20| Is there any further discussion on the amendment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=8240)|
| 2:17:24| Seeing none, would you conduct a roll call vote on the amendment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=8244)|

| 2:19:52| I'm the president of the Knoxville Firefighters Association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=8392)|
| 2:19:55| As well as the battalion chief of the city of Knoxville Fire Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=8395)|
| 2:19:59| Thank you all tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=8399)|
| 2:20:00| Can you hear me OK? Because I'm on a phone here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=8400)|
| 2:20:03| OK, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=8403)|
| 2:20:05| If you could see me, I parted my hair| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=8405)|
| 2:20:07| differently if you remembered what I look like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=8407)|
| 2:20:09| So you probably wouldn't recognize me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=8409)|
| 2:20:12| But no, I thank you all tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=8412)|
| 2:20:14| I'm glad to see and hopefully hopefully see this move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=8414)|
| 2:20:18| The last time we spoke.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=8418)|
| 2:20:20| We spoke about the of course, the HR department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=8420)|
| 2:20:24| I think this is very important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=8424)|
| 2:20:26| I think the separation is very important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=8426)|
| 2:20:28| It would utilize the HR department to focus, focus on the on the hours that I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=8428)|
| 2:20:33| mentioned before, research, recruit, reward, review, revise, reclassify and retain our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=8433)|
| 2:20:39| workers, not only in the uniformed bodies, police and fire, but the general| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=8439)|
| 2:20:44| government and the public works department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=8444)|
| 2:20:48| It's even more critical right now with everything that's going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=8448)|
| 2:20:51| I don't want to lose employees to different cities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=8451)|
| 2:20:55| Knoxville is a great, great city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=8455)|
| 2:20:57| I mean, as we can see what's going on through through the nation, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=8457)|
| 2:21:01| we're blessed that it's not as bad as it could be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=8461)|
| 2:21:05| But, you know, I'm for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=8465)|
| 2:21:08| If you guys have any questions for me, feel free to ask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=8468)|
| 2:21:12| But I think this is something that has been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=8472)|
| 2:21:16| needed for for quite some time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=8476)|
| 2:21:18| I've been on for 24 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=8478)|
| 2:21:20| And I think that this will will utilize the HR department in a more effective way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=8480)|
| 2:21:27| Again, like I said, for the employees as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=8487)|
| 2:21:29| well as the administration, and I thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=8489)|
| 2:21:33| And like I said, I hope that you all will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=8493)|
| 2:21:35| consider to pass this this evening. So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=8495)|
| 2:21:40| Thank you, Mr. Faddis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=8500)|
| 2:21:41| Next person signed up is Mark Taylor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=8501)|
| 2:21:45| Mr. Taylor, are you on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=8505)|
| 2:21:47| I am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=8507)|
| 2:21:48| OK, thank you for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=8508)|
| 2:21:51| So, you know, the lion, who is the current president of FOP is out on injury and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=8511)|
| 2:21:58| Taylor's former FOP president here speaking on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=8518)|
| 2:22:03| I'll let you explain that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=8523)|
| 2:22:04| But thank you for being here, Mr. Taylor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=8524)|
| 2:22:06| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=8526)|
| 2:22:08| I appreciate the opportunity to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=8528)|
| 2:22:10| My name is Mark Taylor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=8530)|
| 2:22:11| I am the immediate past president of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=8531)|
| 2:22:13| I am the immediate past president of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=8533)|
| 2:22:15| Fraternal Ward Police Volunteer Logistic here in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=8535)|
| 2:22:19| Our address is 720 North Hall, Hall of Fame Drive or 720 Hall of Fame Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=8539)|
| 2:22:25| And I am speaking in favor of the resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=8545)|
| 2:22:32| And perhaps, I mean.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=8552)|
| 2:22:35| The events of the last couple of weeks highlight there, there's never been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=8555)|
| 2:22:41| probably a more important time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=8561)|
| 2:22:44| for the city to be able to hire and train and retain the highest quality individuals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=8564)|
| 2:22:54| because at the end of the day, the city, the the product that the city has to offer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=8574)|
| 2:23:00| Is its employees were a service that that's all a municipality is, it's a service| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=8580)|
| 2:23:05| provider and so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=8585)|
| 2:23:10| public safety and law enforcement is a foundation of that structure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=8590)|
| 2:23:16| It's a critical, critical piece.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=8596)|
| 2:23:19| And pretty much so everything else that the city does is built on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=8599)|
| 2:23:24| those foundations that we can provide public safety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=8604)|
| 2:23:28| It all kind of builds off of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=8608)|
| 2:23:30| So we need a system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=8610)|
| 2:23:35| that allows us to be flexible and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=8615)|
| 2:23:40| capable of adapting to the current labor market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=8620)|
| 2:23:43| And what we've seen, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=8623)|
| 2:23:45| in large, in law enforcement across the nation and definitely here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=8625)|
| 2:23:50| over the last several years, is that changing environments within the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=8630)|
| 2:23:56| labor market and and honestly, within society and views about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=8636)|
| 2:24:02| the profession, different things have really strained our ability to get those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=8642)|
| 2:24:08| resources and in a lot of ways to keep those resources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=8648)|
| 2:24:13| You don't want to invest all that and then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=8653)|
| 2:24:15| lose it because the next person you hire back may not be as good as the person| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=8655)|
| 2:24:20| you're going out the door. You want to keep the best people that you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=8660)|
| 2:24:23| can, you want to get the best people here and you want to keep them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=8663)|
| 2:24:27| So currently, I think our system is too slow and too rigid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=8667)|
| 2:24:31| It's just not equipped to be competitive in this environment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=8671)|
| 2:24:38| Second part, I believe that this ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=8678)|
| 2:24:41| would remove conflicts that are in the current system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=8681)|
| 2:24:45| The mayor used the terminology, the fox guard in the hen house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=8685)|
| 2:24:49| I would tell you it's currently the way we do things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=8689)|
| 2:24:53| It's kind of like the judge that decides your case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=8693)|
| 2:24:58| Is the judge that you pick to hear your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=8698)|
| 2:25:00| appeal, if you disagree with with the verdict| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=8700)|
| 2:25:03| and in certain situations that could be the case with our current system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=8703)|
| 2:25:09| So I think there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=8709)|
| 2:25:12| some gains. I think this would actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=8712)|
| 2:25:13| strengthen and could strengthen civil service by removing some of those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=8713)|
| 2:25:19| conflicts and allowing them to focus on their core functions that I view,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=8719)|
| 2:25:24| which are the employee equity and due process issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=8724)|
| 2:25:28| that that allows it to be a true| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=8728)|
| 2:25:31| employee resource and check and balance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=8731)|
| 2:25:34| that doesn't muddy the waters with these other functions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=8734)|
| 2:25:38| And lastly, and I think this is probably the most important thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=8738)|
| 2:25:44| I believe that this change and implement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=8744)|
| 2:25:47| a fully functioning HR would ensure that decision makers and elected officials| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=8747)|
| 2:25:53| or the chief operating officer, the executives of the city have access| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=8753)|
| 2:25:59| to current and accurate information on the labor market conditions in order| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=8759)|
| 2:26:04| to meet those critical needs for the city to be successful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=8764)|
| 2:26:08| Those critical needs were service industry being.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=8768)|
| 2:26:12| Highly trained and well-qualified applicants and highly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=8772)|
| 2:26:16| trained employees who are satisfied with their job,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=8776)|
| 2:26:21| who have the conditions that they need to be successful in their job,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=8781)|
| 2:26:25| and that we know what that actually means so that we can invest our money wisely| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=8785)|
| 2:26:30| and invest and keep those resources so that they can go do a good job for the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=8790)|
| 2:26:36| It's not good when.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=8796)|
| 2:26:40| When you run, you know, 30, 40, 50 police officers short,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=8800)|
| 2:26:45| it's not good, that's increased stress on the police officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=8805)|
| 2:26:48| The mayor mentioned earlier, and I thank you for that about mental health.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=8808)|
| 2:26:52| It's a stressful job on a good day and it's very tight these days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=8812)|
| 2:26:56| So I speak in favor of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=8816)|
| 2:26:58| I appreciate any consideration you get to give this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=8818)|
| 2:27:01| And I think it could be a really good tool| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=8821)|
| 2:27:04| for the city to help address some of the challenges that we faced| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=8824)|
| 2:27:10| over the last several years. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=8830)|
| 2:27:12| Thank you, Mr. Taylor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=8832)|
| 2:27:14| The next person signed up to speak in favor is Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=8834)|

| 2:27:25| if you could just start by saying your name and address for the record and thank| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=8845)|
| 2:27:29| you for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=8849)|

| 2:27:35| I am a 16 year employee of the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=8855)|
| 2:27:39| I currently work in general government| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=8859)|
| 2:27:41| in the public service department as the manager of Service Area Central,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=8861)|
| 2:27:46| as we call it, so that the downtown Port Sanders Corridor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=8866)|
| 2:27:50| So members of council, I want to thank you for allowing me the opportunity to speak| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=8870)|
| 2:27:55| on what has turned into a contentious issue in general government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=8875)|
| 2:27:59| I began working on this issue along with Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=8879)|
| 2:28:02| Faddis and Mr. Lyons as an employee rep during the final year of Mayor O'Hara's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=8882)|

| 2:28:10| of the need for a human resources department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=8890)|
| 2:28:13| However, following the conversations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=8893)|
| 2:28:15| with both Mayor O'Hara and the civil service director, Vicki Hatfield,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=8895)|
| 2:28:19| I began to see some of the potential benefits to the creation of this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=8899)|
| 2:28:22| department, such as discipline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=8902)|
| 2:28:25| Currently, department directors reach out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=8905)|
| 2:28:27| to civil service on matters of discipline concerning their employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=8907)|
| 2:28:31| The employees also reach out to civil service for their protections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=8911)|
| 2:28:36| I'm a supervisor of 40 plus employees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=8916)|
| 2:28:38| so I understand the need for support with personnel issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=8918)|
| 2:28:42| The civil service is and should be there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=8922)|
| 2:28:45| for the employee, but who is there for the supervisor and administration?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=8925)|
| 2:28:50| Having the same department perform both| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=8930)|
| 2:28:52| functions is an immediate conflict that an HR department can remedy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=8932)|
| 2:28:57| In recruiting in the public service department, I know that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=8937)|
| 2:29:02| have tried various methods of recruiting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=8942)|
| 2:29:04| some of which include posting on Indeed.com and placing now hiring| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=8944)|
| 2:29:08| magnets on our trucks so citizens throughout the city of Knoxville can see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=8948)|
| 2:29:11| the posting and inquire on how to apply.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=8951)|
| 2:29:14| We have also utilized Facebook and various social media platforms as well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=8954)|
| 2:29:18| as attended numerous career fairs at local schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=8958)|
| 2:29:21| We have utilized monies from our budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=8961)|
| 2:29:23| to do so because we're struggling to find qualified candidates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=8963)|
| 2:29:27| Currently, civil service handles recruitment and job postings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=8967)|
| 2:29:30| which includes sending an email for the job postings for the promotional| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=8970)|
| 2:29:37| jobs for the department to make available to their current employees and putting job| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=8977)|
| 2:29:41| announcements in the newspaper for entry level jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=8981)|
| 2:29:44| An HR department would be better suited| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=8984)|
| 2:29:46| to reach out and explore new avenues of recruitment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=8986)|
| 2:29:50| On training, civil service has developed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=8990)|
| 2:29:52| several several trainings that they perform, which I feel are extremely| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=8992)|
| 2:29:56| beneficial to employees, their basic supervisor boot camp| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=8996)|
| 2:30:00| training is second to none.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=9000)|
| 2:30:02| I've also taken their diversity training| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=9002)|
| 2:30:04| as well as their basic evaluations training,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=9004)|
| 2:30:06| all of which are exceptional trainings that taught me invaluable skills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=9006)|
| 2:30:11| However, these are geared toward administrative and supervisory positions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=9011)|
| 2:30:15| In my department, civil service does not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=9015)|
| 2:30:17| offer training on how to operate equipment or even basic automotive skills| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=9017)|
| 2:30:22| to help you potentially promote or transfer within your department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=9022)|
| 2:30:26| They also don't offer OSHA required bloodborne pathogens training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=9026)|
| 2:30:30| These trainings are left up to the departments themselves to find and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=9030)|
| 2:30:33| coordinate an HR department can begin to develop the trainings needed to provide a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=9033)|
| 2:30:38| way for the departments to cross train employees who then can develop their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=9038)|
| 2:30:43| skills, even if they never make it to administrative positions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=9043)|
| 2:30:48| These are only a few of the reasons that I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=9048)|
| 2:30:50| found in favor of reinstating a human resources department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=9050)|
| 2:30:54| Now, I do want to be clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=9054)|
| 2:30:56| I no longer represent the City Employees Association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=9056)|
| 2:31:00| During the time I did, I followed the will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=9060)|
| 2:31:03| of the people who voted in our meetings and elected me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=9063)|
| 2:31:06| Those who showed up and voted strongly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=9066)|
| 2:31:08| disagree with the creation of this department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=9068)|
| 2:31:11| I can tell you that from my time as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=9071)|
| 2:31:13| president, we have a membership of around 200 people, which is about a quarter of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=9073)|
| 2:31:19| the general government population.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=9079)|
| 2:31:22| I can tell you that out of the 200 that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=9082)|
| 2:31:24| we have, typically less than a quarter of those show up to vote in these meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=9084)|
| 2:31:29| So while they are they did vote in their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=9089)|
| 2:31:32| last meeting to resist this ordinance, we were less than 50 people who voted in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=9092)|
| 2:31:39| that meeting, so 50 out of 800 isn't isn't technically a great majority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=9099)|
| 2:31:48| Whenever I talk to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=9108)|
| 2:31:51| whenever I look at this and I begin to see that my co-workers fears,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=9111)|
| 2:31:56| their greatest fear is that their protections are slowly being chipped away at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=9116)|
| 2:32:01| And I want to try and ease minds yet once again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=9121)|
| 2:32:06| I am a civil service employee and don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=9126)|
| 2:32:08| want to lose any of the protections that affords me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=9128)|
| 2:32:11| This ordinance does not change any aspect of the city of Knoxville Charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=9131)|
| 2:32:16| And according to Article 10, Section one, oh, three, paragraph F Powers and Duties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=9136)|
| 2:32:22| line 12 civil service is to direct that personnel practices which are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=9142)|
| 2:32:28| inconsistent with or in violation of the provision that you've got to wrap it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=9148)|
| 2:32:34| That's five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=9154)|
| 2:32:36| OK, well, in closing, I've attended four| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=9156)|
| 2:32:39| meetings with American Cannon to Public Works, two on Zoom, and she has been very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=9159)|
| 2:32:44| open to listen to us and to our opinions in the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=9164)|
| 2:32:48| I appreciate the changes that have been made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=9168)|
| 2:32:51| We've worked on this for 16 months and it's not something that we came up with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=9171)|
| 2:32:56| overnight, and I appreciate your consideration and hope that you vote to support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=9176)|
| 2:33:02| Thank you, Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=9182)|

| 2:33:09| the proposal is that you have to have children on the line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=9189)|
| 2:33:13| I am on the line. Can you hear me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=9193)|
| 2:33:15| Yes, we can. OK,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=9195)|
| 2:33:18| I'm sure Vicki Hatfield, civil service director, 400 Main Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=9198)|
| 2:33:23| I'm here tonight for employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=9203)|
| 2:33:25| My purpose tonight is to ensure you understand the full impact of the proposed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=9205)|
| 2:33:29| ordinance and to ensure, you know, there are alternatives that have been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=9209)|
| 2:33:33| provided to the administration, but that are not before you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=9213)|
| 2:33:36| I'd like to read from the proposed ordinance in all cases where the duty is not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=9216)|
| 2:33:40| expressly charged to any other department, including but not limited to the civil| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=9220)|
| 2:33:45| service merit board, it shall be the exclusive duty and exclusive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=9225)|
| 2:33:50| authority of the director of human resources exclusive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=9230)|
| 2:33:54| I feel that word best describes this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=9234)|
| 2:33:56| ordinance and the process used to create it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=9236)|
| 2:33:58| The process to create this ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=9238)|
| 2:34:00| excluded employees who will be impacted by it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=9240)|
| 2:34:03| It excluded the public by being presented during a pandemic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=9243)|
| 2:34:06| Most importantly, it excluded the department that has performed this work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=9246)|
| 2:34:10| for thirty five years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=9250)|
| 2:34:11| It was written without discussing what functions we do, how we do them, how they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=9251)|
| 2:34:15| will be impacted with no plan in place about how functions will be maintained.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=9255)|
| 2:34:20| I want to ensure you understand how the specific language the administration has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=9260)|
| 2:34:25| selected to use will impact your personnel system and employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=9265)|
| 2:34:29| On June 16, it was written to absolutely and completely exclude civil service from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=9269)|
| 2:34:34| performing any duty, not specifically assigned to it under the charter upon| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=9274)|

| 2:34:58| mayor's office, all performance evaluations, unemployment claims, all July class| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=9298)|
| 2:35:04| comp processes and annual tuition reimbursements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=9304)|
| 2:35:07| These are just a few of the tasks performed by civil service that will become| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=9307)|
| 2:35:11| the exclusive duty and authority of the H.R.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=9311)|
| 2:35:14| Department who will have no staff, no rules and no processes in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=9314)|
| 2:35:19| I hope that you will ask the administration exactly what duties this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=9319)|
| 2:35:22| ordinance transfers to them and how they plan to administer those duties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=9322)|
| 2:35:27| I do not expect that they can answer either| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=9327)|
| 2:35:29| question. This ordinance was written to be exclusive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=9329)|
| 2:35:32| Understand the impact of that exclusivity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=9332)|
| 2:35:35| I hope that you my objective when this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=9335)|
| 2:35:38| process started was to be inclusive and to work together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=9338)|
| 2:35:41| Two years ago, when Mayor O'Hara began plans to create an H.R.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=9341)|
| 2:35:44| Department without including civil service, I reached out because I thought the idea| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=9344)|
| 2:35:49| had merit that might surprise you, but I thought it was a good idea and I wanted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=9349)|
| 2:35:53| to help and anticipated a project where we would work together toward a shared| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=9353)|
| 2:35:57| goal, one where all stakeholders would take the time to examine, understand and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=9357)|
| 2:36:01| plan. I believe the administration employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=9361)|
| 2:36:04| and civil service would bring something to council together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=9364)|
| 2:36:07| Instead, the administration drafted this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=9367)|
| 2:36:09| ordinance alone and submitted it in March before advising civil service or employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=9369)|
| 2:36:14| This ordinance is the product of only one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=9374)|
| 2:36:16| work group meeting and only one employee meeting in an almost two year period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=9376)|
| 2:36:21| Even after that, I still reached out to the mayor and requested to meet to propose| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=9381)|
| 2:36:26| ways the ordinance could be revised.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=9386)|
| 2:36:28| There is a way to create an H.R.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=9388)|
| 2:36:30| Department that would be cooperative and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=9390)|
| 2:36:32| collaborative, but that is not what you have before you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=9392)|
| 2:36:35| This ordinance moves most of the duties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=9395)|
| 2:36:37| performed by civil service to an undefined H.R. Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=9397)|
| 2:36:40| There's little added value.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=9400)|
| 2:36:42| It's mostly a shift of authority from an independent board of five volunteers that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=9402)|
| 2:36:46| takes merit principles and workers protections into account in all aspects of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=9406)|
| 2:36:50| personnel in H.R. Department under the authority of one person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=9410)|
| 2:36:54| I know having personnel outside the control| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=9414)|
| 2:36:56| of the administration is frustrating to a mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=9416)|
| 2:36:58| I'm sure operating within rules and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=9418)|
| 2:37:00| processes that aren't your own feels restricted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=9420)|
| 2:37:03| Each administration would prefer to do as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=9423)|
| 2:37:05| they wish, but is this in the best interest of the city or the employees?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=9425)|
| 2:37:09| This ordinance benefits the administration, but the price is played by employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=9429)|
| 2:37:13| I've been with the city for 21 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=9433)|
| 2:37:15| and this is the most divisive event I've witnessed in my tenure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=9435)|
| 2:37:19| Employees are not in agreement on this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=9439)|
| 2:37:20| and an overwhelming number do not support it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=9440)|
| 2:37:23| In addition to functional concerns and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=9443)|
| 2:37:25| employee concerns that have gone unanswered,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=9445)|
| 2:37:27| there are also legal concerns that have not been answered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=9447)|
| 2:37:30| Are you certain this ordinance doesn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=9450)|
| 2:37:32| infringe on charter functions of civil service?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=9452)|
| 2:37:35| There are also budget concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=9455)|
| 2:37:36| I continue to hear that personnel was only combined with civil service for budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=9456)|
| 2:37:41| reasons as a cost saving measure is the need for efficiency gone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=9461)|
| 2:37:45| In her own email titled Pandemic Budget Constraints,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=9465)|
| 2:37:48| the mayor said there will be few new starts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=9468)|
| 2:37:50| Thirty seconds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=9470)|
| 2:37:51| The department will require more than two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=9471)|
| 2:37:52| positions as well as space, furniture, equipment and recurring salary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=9472)|
| 2:37:57| and operating budget to recreate the work of an existing department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=9477)|
| 2:38:01| This ordinance was not written in a cooperative spirit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=9481)|
| 2:38:04| It was written and submitted during a time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=9484)|
| 2:38:05| of uncertainty, crisis and budget challenges represents many unanswered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=9485)|
| 2:38:10| functional, legal and employee concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=9490)|
| 2:38:12| I hope for these reasons you will not approve this ordinance as written.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=9492)|
| 2:38:16| Only council has the power to assign personnel administration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=9496)|
| 2:38:19| There's a better way to do this in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=9499)|

| 2:38:26| There are ways to revisit this in a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=9506)|
| 2:38:29| collaborative and in cooperative spirit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=9509)|
| 2:38:31| Thank you for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=9511)|

| 2:38:34| Next person is Arturo Cano.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=9514)|
| 2:38:38| Mr. Cano, are you on the line?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=9518)|
| 2:38:44| Can you hear me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=9524)|
| 2:38:45| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=9525)|
| 2:38:46| My name is Arturo Cano and I reside at five nine zero seven Magazine Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=9526)|
| 2:38:52| Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=9532)|
| 2:38:55| As elected officials, you represent the best interest for the city of Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=9535)|
| 2:39:00| which means being good stewards of taxpayer money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=9540)|
| 2:39:04| How can you all justify passing this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=9544)|
| 2:39:07| ordinance and adding two positions at a cost of a quarter million dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=9547)|
| 2:39:12| when the positions were added to the budget in Mayor O'Hara's final year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=9552)|
| 2:39:16| It was for a human resource analyst and a special assistant position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=9556)|
| 2:39:21| Civil service can use that position to better serve the department for retention| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=9561)|
| 2:39:26| and recruiting. Also, if you all do pass this ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=9566)|
| 2:39:30| think about the money it will cost the taxpayers in court because under the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=9570)|
| 2:39:34| charter, compensation and classification lies directly with civil service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=9574)|
| 2:39:40| The charter is the city of Knoxville's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=9580)|
| 2:39:42| constitution and must be followed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=9582)|
| 2:39:44| Civil service has tried to work with this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=9584)|
| 2:39:47| administration since the last meeting, but this administration refuses to compromise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=9587)|
| 2:39:52| The general government employees represent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=9592)|
| 2:39:55| fifty four percent of the workforce and they have voted against this ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=9595)|
| 2:39:59| as well as the Civil Service Merit Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=9599)|
| 2:40:02| Does that not count for anything?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=9602)|
| 2:40:04| Had the general government employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=9604)|
| 2:40:06| supported this ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=9606)|
| 2:40:09| we, too, would have received the five hundred dollar bribe money for essential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=9609)|
| 2:40:13| workers. Some of you are going to vote for this ordinance regardless because your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=9613)|
| 2:40:17| loyalty is to the mayor and not to the citizens of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=9617)|
| 2:40:20| Also,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=9620)|
| 2:40:22| we have met with the mayor just one time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=9622)|
| 2:40:25| as employees and Mr. Robbie Quorum has met with her four times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=9625)|
| 2:40:28| How is that possible?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=9628)|
| 2:40:30| And most of the people that are supporting this measure report directly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=9630)|
| 2:40:35| to an appointed elected official.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=9635)|
| 2:40:38| That is all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=9638)|
| 2:40:40| Thank you, Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=9640)|
| 2:40:40| Cano, the next person who signed up to speak is Steve King.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=9640)|

| 2:40:49| Are you on the line?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=9649)|
| 2:40:52| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=9652)|
| 2:40:53| OK, if you could start by stating your name| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=9653)|
| 2:40:55| and address for the record, you have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=9655)|
| 2:40:58| Thank you, Mayor. My name is Steve King.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=9658)|
| 2:41:00| I live at sixty sixteen Apache Trail,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=9660)|

| 2:41:06| Many of you know me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=9666)|
| 2:41:09| I'm in a little different role now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=9669)|
| 2:41:11| I'm the newly elected president of the City Employees Association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=9671)|
| 2:41:16| I've worked for the city for forty two years in the engineering department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=9676)|
| 2:41:22| I've worked for, as you can imagine, several mayors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=9682)|
| 2:41:25| I think it's seven mayors and in some kind of management role.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=9685)|
| 2:41:31| I've I've worked with three different civil| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=9691)|
| 2:41:35| service directors, meant the roads, Karen Day and Vicki Hatfield.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=9695)|
| 2:41:39| I've had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=9699)|
| 2:41:41| I've worked on both sides of grievances,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=9701)|
| 2:41:43| I've had grievances filed against me as a supervisor that I've worked with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=9703)|
| 2:41:48| civil service and the city law department to go through the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=9708)|
| 2:41:53| I've actually filed one grievance myself| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=9713)|
| 2:41:56| that I had to hire an attorney to keep my job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=9716)|
| 2:42:00| Of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=9720)|
| 2:42:03| I've listened very closely to council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=9723)|
| 2:42:06| meetings, workshops, civil service board meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=9726)|
| 2:42:10| the mayor's listening sessions, which I appreciate her openness and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=9730)|
| 2:42:15| willingness to meet with with employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=9735)|
| 2:42:19| But I guess the thing I'm most concerned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=9739)|
| 2:42:23| about, I have I have respect for attorneys on both sides of this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=9743)|
| 2:42:28| I've known Mr. Swanson for a long time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=9748)|
| 2:42:31| and Mr. Shields for a few months now since he's been with the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=9751)|
| 2:42:37| And.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=9757)|
| 2:42:38| We hear from the employees here from them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=9758)|
| 2:42:41| that and the mayor that nothing in this ordinance will change our protections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=9761)|
| 2:42:46| Well, when I sat in on a five and a half hour civil service merit board meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=9766)|
| 2:42:52| and hear| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=9772)|
| 2:42:54| attorney Mike Winchester go through issues for five and a half hours, I hear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=9774)|
| 2:43:01| Multiple concerns, and at the end of that meeting, a motion was made and seconded to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=9781)|
| 2:43:08| oppose the proposed ordinance in its entirety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=9788)|
| 2:43:12| And the vote was three to two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=9792)|
| 2:43:15| So when employees see that kind of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=9795)|
| 2:43:20| You know, we're not attorneys, we're we're public servants, so we become concerned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=9800)|
| 2:43:26| about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=9806)|
| 2:43:28| Where our future is and what our what our future protections might be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=9808)|
| 2:43:35| We think this this mayor is doing a good job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=9815)|
| 2:43:39| We we believe her when she says she's not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=9819)|
| 2:43:42| going to use anything to target employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=9822)|
| 2:43:46| And it's it's refreshing to hear that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=9826)|
| 2:43:49| But we're concerned about the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=9829)|
| 2:43:52| So my suggestion is that we continue to work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=9832)|
| 2:43:56| The law department continue to work with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=9836)|
| 2:43:58| the civil service merit board and their attorney to try to get to a situation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=9838)|
| 2:44:04| where we're in a more agreeable, compromising position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=9844)|
| 2:44:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=9850)|
| 2:44:12| Thank you, Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=9852)|
| 2:44:14| King.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=9854)|
| 2:44:15| Next person spoke, signed up to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=9855)|
| 2:44:17| The fourth person in opposition is Stephanie Guptill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=9857)|
| 2:44:20| Guptill, are you on the line?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=9860)|
| 2:44:22| I'm on the line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=9862)|
| 2:44:23| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=9863)|
| 2:44:24| You have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=9864)|
| 2:44:26| First of all, I didn't think you all would allow a fourth speaker because you don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=9866)|
| 2:44:30| typically do that, so I may be not as prepared as I hope I would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=9870)|
| 2:44:34| I currently serve as the secretary for the City Employees Association,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=9874)|
| 2:44:39| representing our general government members, and they are whom I'm speaking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=9879)|
| 2:44:43| on behalf of today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=9883)|
| 2:44:45| In the past few months, I've listened to more city council meetings than ever| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=9885)|
| 2:44:49| before, and there is one thing in particular that has stuck out to me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=9889)|
| 2:44:53| when certain issues come before you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=9893)|
| 2:44:56| I have heard it mentioned several times| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=9896)|
| 2:44:58| that you as council members want to, wherever possible, facilitate good| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=9898)|
| 2:45:03| neighbors to try to bring two sides together for a reasonable resolution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=9903)|
| 2:45:08| to assist with mediation, to come to the best possible outcome for everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=9908)|
| 2:45:13| The potential creation of this human| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=9913)|
| 2:45:15| resource department has created no good neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=9915)|
| 2:45:18| There has been no effective mediation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=9918)|
| 2:45:21| It has only served to divide our employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=9921)|
| 2:45:24| and provide a sense of foreboding in an already unsettling time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=9924)|
| 2:45:29| This process has been a push towards a goal without accommodation of input from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=9929)|
| 2:45:33| general government employees, while also discarding the recommendations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=9933)|
| 2:45:38| of the prior and current administration's work groups| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=9938)|
| 2:45:41| and the department currently handling these responsibilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=9941)|
| 2:45:44| Only Monday did we see the final version of these ordinances before you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=9944)|
| 2:45:50| To proceed while acknowledging only support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=9950)|
| 2:45:53| from police and fire makes general government employees feel as though they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=9953)|
| 2:45:57| do not matter when held up against police and fire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=9957)|
| 2:46:00| Unfortunately, it seems the window to collaborate and work together has closed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=9960)|
| 2:46:05| So now we are asking you to vote against| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=9965)|
| 2:46:08| the ordinances to create the human resources department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=9968)|
| 2:46:12| There have been three workshops where the city's perspective on what this will do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=9972)|
| 2:46:16| has been provided to employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=9976)|
| 2:46:19| This perspective varies tremendously| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=9979)|
| 2:46:21| from the perspective of the attorney who represents the civil service merit board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=9981)|
| 2:46:27| An attorney whose fees on this very matter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=9987)|
| 2:46:29| have exhausted the civil service budget this fiscal year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=9989)|
| 2:46:33| The civil service merit board voted three| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=9993)|
| 2:46:35| to two against supporting the ordinances as written.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=9995)|
| 2:46:39| The three board members with the most| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=9999)|
| 2:46:41| experience on the board do not believe this is in the best interest of employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=10001)|
| 2:46:47| General government employees are open| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=10007)|
| 2:46:49| for change and improvement and agree there are needed changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=10009)|
| 2:46:54| We need more marketing and recruiting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=10014)|
| 2:46:57| We need someone to advise departments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=10017)|
| 2:46:59| on discipline so civil service can focus on representing employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=10019)|
| 2:47:04| KPD has brought up lots of great points| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=10024)|
| 2:47:06| about changes needed in their recruit process and testing requirements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=10026)|
| 2:47:10| and processes for their applicants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=10030)|
| 2:47:12| We as a city also have the same issue as most cities in the United States| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=10032)|
| 2:47:16| struggling to recruit and retain officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=10036)|
| 2:47:19| Fewer people are choosing law enforcement as a career than ever before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=10039)|
| 2:47:24| Our administration can incentivize employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=10044)|
| 2:47:26| and control pay right now without any of these changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=10046)|
| 2:47:30| What we do not need is an entire department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=10050)|
| 2:47:33| and the associated costs to make those things a reality.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=10053)|
| 2:47:39| Right now, there are two budgeted positions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=10059)|
| 2:47:41| for this department, a cost of one hundred and seventy nine thousand dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=10061)|
| 2:47:46| in salary and benefits for this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=10066)|
| 2:47:49| However, more positions will be required| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=10069)|
| 2:47:51| to do the work being transferred out of civil service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=10071)|
| 2:47:53| So this cost will grow considerably.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=10073)|
| 2:47:57| Speaking of the transfer of work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=10077)|
| 2:47:58| how will this happen if the ordinance is passed with any change?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=10078)|
| 2:48:02| There are growing pains and a learning curve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=10082)|
| 2:48:04| But right now, there is literally no one who has been trained to do this work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=10084)|
| 2:48:08| The potential legal ramifications of that are huge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=10088)|
| 2:48:12| This could have been a collaborative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=10092)|
| 2:48:14| process with civil service, allowing time for knowledge transfer and training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=10094)|
| 2:48:18| But that did not happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=10098)|
| 2:48:20| It is for these reasons that we ask you vote against the ordinances to create| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=10100)|
| 2:48:24| the Department of Human Resources, thank you for your time and for your service| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=10104)|
| 2:48:28| to our city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=10108)|
| 2:48:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=10110)|
| 2:48:32| Could I get your address, Ms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=10112)|
| 2:48:33| Guptill?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=10113)|
| 2:48:35| Sixty three, twenty four, Netherland Drive, three, seven, nine, one, eight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=10115)|
| 2:48:39| Thank you, Stephanie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=10119)|
| 2:48:42| Council members,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=10122)|
| 2:48:44| that concludes the people who signed up to speak to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=10124)|
| 2:48:47| I just want to say that I think we've worked together the last pretty closely| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=10127)|
| 2:48:52| the last five, five months or so, and I think you know me that I'm a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=10132)|
| 2:48:58| collaborative person and a listener, and that's why we did postpone this two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=10138)|
| 2:49:02| months to listen to counsel, to heed the input from you and from employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=10142)|
| 2:49:08| I think the amended resolution before you is better, is more responsive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=10148)|
| 2:49:13| provides more assurances of a fair process to make sure that civil service| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=10153)|
| 2:49:19| protections are in tact. I don't agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=10159)|
| 2:49:23| I don't disagree that the transition will be hard, but just because things are hard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=10163)|
| 2:49:28| doesn't mean they aren't worth doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=10168)|
| 2:49:30| And when we talk about our city being a model employer, when we talk about being| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=10170)|
| 2:49:36| anti-racist city, when we talk about trying to hire and retain and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=10176)|
| 2:49:43| develop our employees, those are the roles of an HR department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=10183)|
| 2:49:48| Any large organization and city of any size has an HR department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=10188)|
| 2:49:53| We are lucky that we can have an HR| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=10193)|
| 2:49:55| department and civil service department, because that's a really valuable tool| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=10195)|
| 2:49:59| to attract and retain our employees when we talk about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=10199)|
| 2:50:04| Some innovations that we want to do, where we have, you know, when we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=10204)|
| 2:50:09| people who are trained in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=10209)|
| 2:50:12| crisis intervention and de-escalation techniques and all those things, an HR| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=10212)|
| 2:50:16| department can help not directly provide that, but coordinate that training and make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=10216)|
| 2:50:20| sure that people in general government get the training that Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=10220)|
| 2:50:24| Coram was providing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=10224)|
| 2:50:25| That takes a lot of work to train it, but also just to coordinate and find out what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=10225)|
| 2:50:30| the different departments need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=10230)|
| 2:50:32| And I think it's training, it's attracting, retaining, it's helping develop our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=10232)|
| 2:50:37| managers so they are able to do a better job on behalf of our employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=10237)|
| 2:50:43| So I'm happy to take any questions or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=10243)|
| 2:50:47| comments or you guys, I'm sure, have been thinking about this quite a bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=10247)|
| 2:50:52| So I'll I'll leave it to your discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=10252)|
| 2:50:55| and I'm available as are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=10255)|

| 2:51:01| So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=10261)|
| 2:51:03| anybody have any questions or comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=10263)|
| 2:51:05| I'm seeing none.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=10265)|
| 2:51:07| I'm just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=10267)|
| 2:51:10| missing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=10270)|
| 2:51:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=10273)|
| 2:51:16| We've received a lot of email and a lot of phone calls about this issue and, you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=10276)|
| 2:51:21| know, my two year, two and a half years on council, I've gotten to know a lot of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=10281)|
| 2:51:24| city employees, there are different relationships I have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=10284)|
| 2:51:27| There are a lot of people that I truly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=10287)|
| 2:51:30| respect their opinion that have come with a lot of concerns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=10290)|
| 2:51:35| about protection that they're, you know, all the hiring and firing protections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=10295)|
| 2:51:43| I've really looked deeply into this and I'm not I'm feeling comfortable with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=10303)|
| 2:51:49| protections that they will continue to have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=10309)|
| 2:51:51| But perhaps could George Shields speak to that some?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=10311)|
| 2:51:57| Mr. Shields.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=10317)|
| 2:52:01| Mayor, thank you and Councilwoman Singh, thank you as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=10321)|
| 2:52:05| My name is George Shields.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=10325)|
| 2:52:06| I'm with the city law department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=10326)|
| 2:52:09| Councilwoman, you're exactly right about the protections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=10329)|
| 2:52:12| Certainly there have been concerns raised about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=10332)|
| 2:52:15| But as a legal matter, nothing in this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=10335)|
| 2:52:17| ordinance by itself can do anything that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=10337)|
| 2:52:20| interferes at all with anything that's specified in the charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=10340)|
| 2:52:24| It's the difference in Congress passing a law and the federal constitution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=10344)|
| 2:52:28| You know, Congress's law does not override| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=10348)|
| 2:52:30| the Constitution and this ordinance can't override the charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=10350)|
| 2:52:34| Even if someone wanted it to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=10354)|
| 2:52:35| the legal reality is that it just can't it just can't do those things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=10355)|
| 2:52:39| And so what we've tried to do in drafting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=10359)|
| 2:52:41| it is make very clear in several places that wherever the charter says that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=10361)|
| 2:52:46| there's a protection provided to employees, that the charter's word is final| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=10366)|
| 2:52:50| and the ordinance has to be interpreted consistent with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=10370)|
| 2:52:53| So, you know, as we move forward, if you if you enact it, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=10373)|
| 2:52:57| there'll be implementation that follows and that's the way we will implement it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=10377)|
| 2:53:00| We will implement it consistent with those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=10380)|
| 2:53:02| employee protections that are provided in the charter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=10382)|
| 2:53:04| because that's just what the law requires us to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=10384)|
| 2:53:09| Thank you, Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=10389)|
| 2:53:10| Shields, thank you, Ms. Singh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=10390)|
| 2:53:11| The other question that I have is right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=10391)|
| 2:53:14| the civil service director is hired by a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=10394)|
| 2:53:20| by people on a committee that will continue or will that be a mayoral appointment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=10400)|
| 2:53:26| It will continue to be appointed by the civil service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=10406)|
| 2:53:28| Marigold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=10408)|
| 2:53:30| OK, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=10410)|
| 2:53:32| And she serves at their pleasure, you know, so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=10412)|
| 2:53:36| That's their job to oversee her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=10416)|
| 2:53:41| Vice Mayor McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=10421)|
| 2:53:43| Mayor, a couple of questions and I'll start with the Civil Service Merit Board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=10423)|
| 2:53:48| since Councilwoman Singh brought them up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=10428)|
| 2:53:51| So the Civil Service Merit Board members, how are they?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=10431)|
| 2:53:55| Are they appointed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=10435)|
| 2:53:57| And if so, are those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=10437)|
| 2:53:59| OK, appointed by the mayor, I've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=10439)|
| 2:54:04| I think they're five year terms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=10444)|
| 2:54:06| And| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=10446)|
| 2:54:08| they're periodically vacancies that I know and there's some I think there is a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=10448)|
| 2:54:12| requirement that there be at least, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=10452)|
| 2:54:17| one racial minority appointed to the board and one at least one woman or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=10457)|
| 2:54:23| I think those are the requirements I can't think off the top of my head.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=10463)|
| 2:54:26| Mr. Shields or Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=10466)|
| 2:54:28| Swanson, if you can clarify.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=10468)|
| 2:54:31| Mayor, you're correct about that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=10471)|
| 2:54:33| it's that exact composition with those requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=10473)|
| 2:54:36| OK, and so I have a point of one person in my opinion, there's one vacancy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=10476)|
| 2:54:42| and I pointed out recently, Kyrie, Bill Lyons, who you all know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=10482)|
| 2:54:48| And the other appointees are from previous years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=10488)|
| 2:54:51| Is it how many how many terms can can a person serve on the board?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=10491)|
| 2:54:56| You can serve two terms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=10496)|
| 2:54:59| You I think two term limit is and that's Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=10499)|
| 2:55:02| Shields is confirming that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=10502)|
| 2:55:05| OK, so a board member can serve up to two years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=10505)|
| 2:55:11| Right, they can serve up to 10 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=10511)|
| 2:55:14| So.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=10514)|
| 2:55:17| Sometimes there's a lot of change over, but I don't know so far.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=10517)|
| 2:55:22| Yeah, also someone just reminded me that the civil service mayor board members do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=10522)|
| 2:55:27| come to council for confirmation, so you all have a chance to review that and.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=10527)|
| 2:55:33| And so, OK,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=10533)|
| 2:55:37| also, Mayor, I know when Ms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=10537)|
| 2:55:39| Hatfield spoke, she she named a lot of duties that the civil service| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=10539)|
| 2:55:45| office does now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=10545)|
| 2:55:47| Will all of those responsibilities remain in civil service or will those transition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=10547)|
| 2:55:52| with the majority of some of those transition over to the new HR department?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=10552)|
| 2:55:57| Well, if you all approve that, it would officially go to the HR department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=10557)|
| 2:56:00| But I was glad to hear that Ms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=10560)|
| 2:56:01| Hatfield said she's, you know, in a collaborative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=10561)|
| 2:56:05| mindset because it will take collaboration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=10565)|
| 2:56:09| It will take an adjustment period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=10569)|
| 2:56:11| And as I said in my| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=10571)|
| 2:56:13| introductory remarks, I cannot, by law, nor would I want to require this charter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=10573)|
| 2:56:19| precludes I don't know if it's a charter or civil service mayor board rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=10579)|
| 2:56:23| But no, the mayor cannot force anybody to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=10583)|
| 2:56:27| change departments, even if it's the pay, even if it's an increase in pay or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=10587)|
| 2:56:31| anything that has to be something that someone chooses to do by volunteering for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=10591)|
| 2:56:36| an opening or or I can say, would you consider applying for this position?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=10596)|
| 2:56:41| And they could do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=10601)|
| 2:56:42| But I couldn't force that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=10602)|
| 2:56:44| So I would I think that it will take a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=10604)|
| 2:56:47| collaborative effort by the two people that I would be hiring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=10607)|
| 2:56:51| If you guys approve this and.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=10611)|
| 2:56:54| The current people who in civil service are doing HR work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=10614)|
| 2:56:59| and also, I mean, if they do not want to work under the HR department and want to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=10619)|
| 2:57:05| continue in civil service and not do the HR functions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=10625)|
| 2:57:09| then that would also be their prerogative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=10629)|
| 2:57:12| I mean, I have I know that people working on HR functions within the civil service| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=10632)|
| 2:57:17| department are hardworking people who care about our employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=10637)|
| 2:57:19| So I don't think they're just going to drop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=10639)|
| 2:57:21| that responsibility and stop cooperating because they know that the people are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=10641)|
| 2:57:25| suffering who would suffer from that is not me, it's employees across the whole city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=10645)|
| 2:57:29| So we need to work collaboratively.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=10649)|
| 2:57:32| We also have I would be filling those positions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=10652)|
| 2:57:36| And also we have other people who do H.R.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=10656)|
| 2:57:40| work in general government, you know, you aren't official H.R.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=10660)|
| 2:57:44| people, but we have Christine Fitzgerald.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=10664)|
| 2:57:46| We have there's someone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=10666)|
| 2:57:49| Brian Malone, Lieutenant Malone and KPD is, you know, because we don't have an HR| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=10669)|
| 2:57:54| department, they have to dedicate someone who could be out there preventing crime to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=10674)|
| 2:57:57| doing H.R. work. I'm sure that firefighters have some people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=10677)|
| 2:58:02| doing H.R. type work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=10682)|
| 2:58:04| So, you know, those people would would be helpful in coordinating this transition as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=10684)|
| 2:58:09| well. So, Mayor, let me make sure that I clearly understand you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=10689)|
| 2:58:14| So the people who are in civil service today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=10694)|
| 2:58:18| Their responsibilities will transition over to the new H.R. department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=10698)|
| 2:58:23| However, they will still be civil service employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=10703)|
| 2:58:27| I think my concern is, will these people even have enough work to to maintain full| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=10707)|
| 2:58:31| time status? And if they don't, are we saying that in order to remain employed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=10711)|
| 2:58:38| at some juncture when all of their workload pretty much transitions over, they would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=10718)|
| 2:58:43| have to apply for a position in H.R. if there's one still available?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=10723)|
| 2:58:47| I just want to be clear on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=10727)|
| 2:58:49| I'm going to make I'm going to ask Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=10729)|
| 2:58:51| Shields to address this because I don't want to say anything that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=10731)|
| 2:58:55| I'm not an H.R. legal professional and he's said this a lot more than I have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=10735)|
| 2:58:59| So, Mr. Shields, could you address these questions, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=10739)|
| 2:59:02| Sure. Vice Mayor, if I understood your question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=10742)|
| 2:59:05| right, you're asking if every responsibility that Dr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=10745)|
| 2:59:08| Hatfield named would be moving over to the H.R.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=10748)|
| 2:59:11| department as a result of this ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=10751)|
| 2:59:14| And the first at least that was the first part, I think, of your question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=10754)|
| 2:59:17| And so the first answer to that is no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=10757)|
| 2:59:20| What Dr. Hatfield named was a much broader| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=10760)|
| 2:59:22| list of responsibilities that goes beyond just the responsibilities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=10762)|
| 2:59:26| that would be moving over to the H.R. department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=10766)|
| 2:59:29| So so not everything that I'm sorry,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=10769)|
| 2:59:32| not everything that civil service does today moves as a result of this ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=10772)|
| 2:59:37| Only the subset of what civil service does that was formerly performed by the old| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=10777)|
| 2:59:42| personnel department is moving over to H.R.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=10782)|
| 2:59:45| So the merit protection function that civil| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=10785)|
| 2:59:48| service has and any of its other charter specified functions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=10788)|
| 2:59:53| you know, investigations in certain circumstances, for example,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=10793)|
| 2:59:57| those all of those charter based functions stay right where they are with civil service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=10797)|
| 3:00:01| It's only what the personnel department used| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=10801)|
| 3:00:04| to do that's moving over back to the H.R. department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=10804)|
| 3:00:08| So and I understand that, but it sounds like the majority of those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=10808)|
| 3:00:12| responsibilities would transition out, I'm very clear that not all of them would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=10812)|
| 3:00:17| But it sounds like the majority of those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=10817)|
| 3:00:20| responsibilities would fall under a personnel or H.R. department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=10820)|
| 3:00:25| So with that said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=10825)|
| 3:00:29| the second part of my question is, if these employees do not have enough work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=10829)|
| 3:00:34| would they have to apply to work in the H.R. department if they're even| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=10834)|
| 3:00:40| positions available for them to do so?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=10840)|
| 3:00:43| Because I think in that spirit of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=10843)|
| 3:00:44| collaboration, they would continue to do this work as it transitions over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=10844)|
| 3:00:49| But is it really fair to those employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=10849)|
| 3:00:52| if they don't have enough work to do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=10852)|
| 3:00:53| And it sounds like what I'm understanding and what I've kind of read over,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=10853)|
| 3:00:58| that there would not be enough work to keep these employees full time as their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=10858)|
| 3:01:02| status is today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=10862)|
| 3:01:04| Well, first, I just want to I want to say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=10864)|
| 3:01:06| that I'll let Mr. Shields or Mr. Bray speak, like nobody in civil service is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=10866)|
| 3:01:12| going to lose their job or have any kind of demotion at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=10872)|
| 3:01:16| That's why we have civil service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=10876)|
| 3:01:17| I mean, that's one of the reasons they're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=10877)|
| 3:01:18| protected, just like other members of civil service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=10878)|
| 3:01:20| So, Mr. Bray, maybe you and I anticipate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=10880)|
| 3:01:24| working closely with the current members of civil service and in this Hatfield| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=10884)|
| 3:01:29| on on this transition, if council approves this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=10889)|
| 3:01:32| Mr. Bray, could you speak to some of the particulars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=10892)|
| 3:01:36| that Vice Mayor McKenzie was asking about?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=10896)|
| 3:01:39| Yeah, so I think it's important to note that, yes, there are the functions in human| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=10899)|
| 3:01:45| resources, these two full time positions over time that will grow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=10905)|
| 3:01:52| There are three positions in civil service that over time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=10912)|
| 3:01:56| retirements will happen that I could see reallocating those to the human resources| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=10916)|
| 3:02:01| department again when they're open and available,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=10921)|
| 3:02:05| not forced when someone retires.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=10925)|
| 3:02:07| We always look at those positions and try| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=10927)|
| 3:02:09| to make a business decision about what the best use is for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=10929)|
| 3:02:13| And again, as as functions decrease and civil service focuses on their core| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=10933)|
| 3:02:19| mission, again, of protections for employees, civil service,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=10939)|
| 3:02:22| mayor board, the charter protections that are so important for employees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=10942)|
| 3:02:27| we would see some of that transfer over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=10947)|
| 3:02:29| But no force, no loss of jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=10949)|
| 3:02:32| Did that answer your question, Vice Mayor McKenzie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=10952)|
| 3:02:34| It does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=10954)|
| 3:02:35| I think I still kind of struggle with with those with just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=10955)|
| 3:02:39| the pieces that they would have left if that would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=10959)|
| 3:02:43| equate to full time work for the for these employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=10963)|
| 3:02:46| But I think I hear from the mayor that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=10966)|
| 3:02:49| even if it doesn't at some juncture, that no one is going to lose their job or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=10969)|
| 3:02:54| their positions be reduced to part time as a result of this change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=10974)|
| 3:02:59| Is that is that a correct statement or a fair statement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=10979)|
| 3:03:02| Absolutely correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=10982)|
| 3:03:02| I would never do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=10982)|
| 3:03:03| And it's like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=10983)|
| 3:03:05| you know, the mayor of the city, I wouldn't do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=10985)|
| 3:03:07| But also, that's exactly why we have civil service protections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=10987)|
| 3:03:10| But even if I wanted to, I would not be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=10990)|
| 3:03:13| permitted to and I don't want to do and I'm not permitted to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=10993)|
| 3:03:17| Yeah, I mean, you got to think about the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=10997)|
| 3:03:19| testing and making sure that there are qualified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=10999)|
| 3:03:22| The processes are fair testing, qualified applicants in the lists are qualified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=11002)|
| 3:03:28| I mean, that's really that core.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=11008)|
| 3:03:29| I mean, the core| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=11009)|
| 3:03:31| functions in the charter are about making sure that there's fairness in the system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=11011)|
| 3:03:35| and that qualified people are hired for are determined through testing and other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=11015)|
| 3:03:41| methods and then are available to be hired and those processes are fair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=11021)|
| 3:03:44| So there's still a lot of work and civil service will continue to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=11024)|
| 3:03:48| But again, there will be growth in HR, but we would not anticipate adding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=11028)|
| 3:03:53| significant numbers of positions through retirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=11033)|
| 3:03:56| We could see some of those PCM employee numbers moving over to HR when| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=11036)|
| 3:04:01| opportunities arise, but no one would lose a job and no one would be forced to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=11041)|
| 3:04:07| OK, so Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=11047)|
| 3:04:09| So, Mr. Brace,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=11049)|
| 3:04:11| so as there's retirement in those three positions, let's say two people retire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=11051)|
| 3:04:17| We would not replace those two positions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=11057)|
| 3:04:19| However, we would probably reallocate those positions into HR.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=11059)|
| 3:04:23| That's that's what I would anticipate over time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=11063)|
| 3:04:25| And again, we would we're excited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=11065)|
| 3:04:27| It is hard work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=11067)|
| 3:04:28| We would want to work collaboratively with Miss with Dr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=11068)|
| 3:04:30| Hatfield. She's been here two decades.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=11070)|
| 3:04:33| I've been here 17 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=11073)|
| 3:04:34| We've worked together on a lot of projects and we would want to work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=11074)|
| 3:04:37| collaboratively. It is hard, but but it's worth it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=11077)|
| 3:04:40| I mean, all the issues we've been talking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=11080)|
| 3:04:42| about on on retention and attraction, I mean, it is worth that effort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=11082)|
| 3:04:47| So hopefully that answered your question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=11087)|
| 3:04:50| Vice Mayor McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=11090)|
| 3:04:52| It does, I think I still kind of struggle a little bit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=11092)|
| 3:04:55| with the fact that we'll go from three people in civil service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=11095)|
| 3:05:00| And we we're saying that there's enough| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=11100)|
| 3:05:02| work for them to do now, but at some point as they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=11102)|
| 3:05:07| attrition out that we would not replace those those functions in civil service,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=11107)|
| 3:05:12| but move them over to HR.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=11112)|
| 3:05:14| So are we saying that long term civil| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=11114)|
| 3:05:18| service looks like one one position, which would be the director position to do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=11118)|
| 3:05:23| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=11123)|
| 3:05:24| What I'm saying is that the opportunities that we'd see in the near future would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=11124)|
| 3:05:27| through retirements or happen to be two to three of those coming up at the first| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=11127)|
| 3:05:31| of the year. And so civil service is is more than four people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=11131)|
| 3:05:35| And so but we would see some shift of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=11135)|
| 3:05:38| resources again, not forced, but as opportunities arise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=11138)|
| 3:05:42| in the future as more demands and we transition over some of those functions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=11142)|
| 3:05:47| over to HR and so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=11147)|
| 3:05:50| no civil service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=11150)|
| 3:05:51| I would not anticipate them having one employee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=11151)|
| 3:05:54| I would anticipate them continuing to be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=11154)|
| 3:05:57| you know, doing those functions that they do now focused on testing and employee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=11157)|
| 3:06:04| protections and when employees have concerns about disciplinary action and fairness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=11164)|
| 3:06:08| And so, again, retirements, they may transfer over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=11168)|
| 3:06:13| That's how we would meet that new growth in HR.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=11173)|
| 3:06:16| And that's that's really the the collaborative approach we want to take.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=11176)|
| 3:06:22| And not to be nitpicky, but you just mentioned disciplinary action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=11182)|
| 3:06:25| Fairness would be addressed in civil service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=11185)|
| 3:06:29| Yeah. So an employee, let's say an employee got| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=11189)|
| 3:06:31| three days off, you know, that there was a director that took| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=11191)|
| 3:06:36| employee action and gave that employee time off and that the employee disagreed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=11196)|
| 3:06:39| with that, that grievance process, the employee would go to civil service| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=11199)|
| 3:06:44| to Dr. Hatfield and her staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=11204)|
| 3:06:47| And there is a procedure for a multi-step procedure to go through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=11207)|
| 3:06:54| when an employee feels concerned about fairness with disparate disciplinary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=11214)|
| 3:06:58| action that would all stay within George.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=11218)|
| 3:07:00| Feel free to jump in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=11220)|
| 3:07:01| That would all stay with civil service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=11221)|
| 3:07:03| Those base protections and grievance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=11223)|
| 3:07:05| reviews, they were civil service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=11225)|
| 3:07:08| And vice mayor, I would just say that that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=11228)|
| 3:07:10| exactly the reason that I want to separate the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=11230)|
| 3:07:14| the two roles right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=11234)|
| 3:07:16| The same people who are adjudicating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=11236)|
| 3:07:19| grievances are also responsible for administering the HR functions in the first| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=11239)|
| 3:07:23| place, so separating those out will will will be fair for employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=11243)|
| 3:07:28| So the same person, as Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=11248)|
| 3:07:31| Taylor said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=11251)|
| 3:07:32| the judge and the appellant judge, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=11252)|
| 3:07:36| separation, getting rid of the fox, starting the henhouse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=11256)|
| 3:07:41| I think Ms. Fugitt had some questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=11261)|
| 3:07:44| or you want to come back to you, Vice Mayor, if you have more follow up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=11264)|
| 3:07:47| Ms. Fugitt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=11267)|
| 3:07:50| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=11270)|
| 3:07:51| So, Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=11271)|
| 3:07:53| Shields, it sounded to me like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=11273)|
| 3:07:56| when Ms. Hatfield was going through her or somebody talked about the authority| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=11276)|
| 3:08:02| of this switch to the HR department, the way I hear that, that doesn't mean that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=11282)|
| 3:08:11| Two weeks from now or a month from now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=11291)|
| 3:08:18| Everything changes, my assumption is that if the authority is with the mayor to have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=11298)|
| 3:08:24| those functions done, she could work out with whomever like is already being done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=11304)|
| 3:08:31| Other departments are helping do some things in the absence of an HR department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=11311)|
| 3:08:36| So it sounds reasonable to me that this happens over time that there's no one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=11316)|
| 3:08:45| for anyone to report to until this is authorized and an HR| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=11325)|
| 3:08:51| department head can be hired.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=11331)|
| 3:08:54| So I think that I want to tamp down some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=11334)|
| 3:08:58| fear that if this happens, then in two weeks or a month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=11338)|
| 3:09:03| the wheels fall off and there's nobody there to do the work is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=11343)|
| 3:09:07| Am I correct in that assumption?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=11347)|
| 3:09:11| Councilwoman, you are correct about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=11351)|
| 3:09:13| You're right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=11353)|
| 3:09:14| HR is happening in lots of places in the city right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=11354)|
| 3:09:17| A lot of it's happening in civil service| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=11357)|
| 3:09:19| because civil service inherited the former personnel department role.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=11359)|
| 3:09:23| But HR is happening in the law department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=11363)|
| 3:09:25| HR is happening in other departments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=11365)|
| 3:09:27| police and fire, you name it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=11367)|
| 3:09:30| And so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=11370)|
| 3:09:31| that cooperative sort of network of HR| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=11371)|
| 3:09:35| experience across the city can help launch this, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=11375)|
| 3:09:39| and can help deliver on those initial functions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=11379)|
| 3:09:42| But we can't start to do any of those things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=11382)|
| 3:09:44| You know, the mayor the mayor wouldn't be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=11384)|
| 3:09:46| able to hire someone even to initiate that until the council approves this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=11386)|
| 3:09:51| I mean, I would just say as someone who| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=11391)|
| 3:09:55| relies a lot on an HR department in her own| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=11395)|
| 3:09:59| professional life, that they're invaluable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=11399)|
| 3:10:03| I could when the pandemic hit in my office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=11403)|
| 3:10:07| it was my HR person that came to me with the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=11407)|
| 3:10:12| I didn't have to scramble.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=11412)|
| 3:10:14| She took ownership of the fact that it was her responsibility to take care| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=11414)|
| 3:10:18| of the welfare of our employees, and she's been the point person on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=11418)|
| 3:10:23| So I do think that that's a wonderful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=11423)|
| 3:10:27| Larger benefit that perhaps an HR professional could bring,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=11427)|
| 3:10:32| I'll also say as someone who has managed people and worked for people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=11432)|
| 3:10:37| sometimes you disagree with your boss.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=11437)|
| 3:10:40| And it is and unlike the private sector,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=11440)|
| 3:10:46| government affords people a civil service protection that is not going away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=11446)|
| 3:10:52| So somebody can advocate for you if you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=11452)|
| 3:10:55| disagree with your boss, unlike the private sector, unless you're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=11455)|
| 3:11:00| represented by a union in the private sector, which which most people are not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=11460)|
| 3:11:03| That's kind of my understanding of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=11463)|
| 3:11:06| And as a supervisor, I mean, we're talking a lot about the employees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=11466)|
| 3:11:10| but I also think we need to take a look at the what we're asking the people who| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=11470)|
| 3:11:15| lead our city to do and lead departments, they've got to feel like they've got| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=11475)|
| 3:11:20| a resource that they can go to that understands things from their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=11480)|
| 3:11:25| perspective and can help them better problem solve before things ever get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=11485)|
| 3:11:32| to a point that there's just one that somebody disagrees with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=11492)|
| 3:11:37| I just think it's an invaluable resource.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=11497)|
| 3:11:39| I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=11499)|
| 3:11:42| I believe we heard we're the only large| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=11502)|
| 3:11:45| city that doesn't have an HR department where these things are combined.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=11505)|
| 3:11:49| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=11509)|
| 3:11:50| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=11510)|
| 3:11:52| So I just I just think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=11512)|
| 3:11:55| I hope| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=11515)|
| 3:11:58| as we talk about making our city better, we would be collaborative, work on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=11518)|
| 3:12:04| And I think this would actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=11524)|
| 3:12:06| strengthen civil service protection when people in the service department are only| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=11526)|
| 3:12:13| focused.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=11533)|
| 3:12:15| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=11535)|
| 3:12:17| Mayor, if I can, if I can add and counsel on a few that I know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=11537)|
| 3:12:23| Yeah, I have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=11543)|
| 3:12:25| Yeah. And so councilwoman, I by no means| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=11545)|
| 3:12:29| meant to imply that I was referring to changes that would happen immediately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=11549)|
| 3:12:32| I'm talking about long term with talking about you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=11552)|
| 3:12:36| No, I know it was said previously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=11556)|
| 3:12:39| Oh, OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=11559)|
| 3:12:41| Yeah, it was said in the public forum piece.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=11561)|
| 3:12:45| It was said in public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=11565)|
| 3:12:46| OK, and the only other thing and we can we can absolutely come back to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=11566)|
| 3:12:50| But because I'm not opposed to an HR department either, I've worked very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=11570)|
| 3:12:55| closely with my HR department in my days of supervising and managing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=11575)|
| 3:12:59| hundreds of people in a call center, but also, Mayor, I wanted to ask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=11579)|
| 3:13:04| So with the HR department, we would be implementing new policies and procedures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=11584)|
| 3:13:09| Would we be looking at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=11589)|
| 3:13:12| a certain direction for best practices?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=11592)|
| 3:13:14| Have we already looked at that or is that to come?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=11594)|
| 3:13:18| Well, I think you raise a good point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=11598)|
| 3:13:20| Like we do need to update our practices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=11600)|
| 3:13:22| And if I if you all prove an HR department, we will be able to look at those best| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=11602)|
| 3:13:27| practices and and I will be responsible with the team of people that are already| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=11607)|
| 3:13:32| working on this for doing that, for example, when the pandemic hit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=11612)|
| 3:13:36| Aaron Gill and Christine, Christina Fitzgerald took the lead in the city's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=11616)|
| 3:13:41| response to how to deal with making our employees safe and giving| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=11621)|
| 3:13:46| them the opportunities to telecommute and making sure we had PPE and not just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=11626)|
| 3:13:50| actions, but policies that were consistent with this new normal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=11630)|
| 3:13:54| So I would expect the same level of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=11634)|
| 3:13:57| innovation and openness and best practices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=11637)|
| 3:14:00| We will be much more able to do that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=11640)|
| 3:14:04| with an HR department because that's what they can specialize in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=11644)|
| 3:14:07| And also we I through and with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=11647)|
| 3:14:11| help of counsel and we also have the ability to review and and have notice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=11651)|
| 3:14:17| and comments on proposed rules and policies, we can collaboratively come up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=11657)|
| 3:14:23| with what is going to work best for public service, what's going to work best| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=11663)|
| 3:14:26| for engineering, what's going to work best for police and fire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=11666)|
| 3:14:30| Asking those department heads, what is it that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=11670)|
| 3:14:34| you what are the challenges you're facing and how can our HR department better serve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=11674)|
| 3:14:38| you? You know that right now that is not happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=11678)|
| 3:14:41| And if and I can't direct it to happen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=11681)|
| 3:14:44| because I don't have an HR department that reports to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=11684)|
| 3:14:48| So the Civil Service Merit Board would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=11688)|
| 3:14:51| that, you know, Ms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=11691)|
| 3:14:53| Hatfield's capacity in the personnel role,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=11693)|
| 3:14:55| she doesn't report to the Civil Service Merit Board either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=11695)|
| 3:14:59| She it's my understanding and Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=11699)|
| 3:15:00| Shields, maybe you can make sure I'm capturing this correctly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=11700)|
| 3:15:04| that Ms. Hatfield reports to the Civil Service Merit Board on the civil service| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=11704)|
| 3:15:09| issues, but on the on the HR functions that she's she's over,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=11709)|
| 3:15:14| she doesn't report to them or to me or to, you know, it's just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=11714)|
| 3:15:18| internal only that is that accurate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=11718)|
| 3:15:22| Mayor, I think that's accurate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=11722)|
| 3:15:24| Certainly in in the merit protection role,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=11724)|
| 3:15:26| it's very clear that Dr. Hatfield reports to the Merit Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=11726)|
| 3:15:30| But in all of the areas that were formerly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=11730)|
| 3:15:32| the personnel department that were then grafted on the civil| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=11732)|
| 3:15:36| service when that department was eliminated for budgetary reasons,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=11736)|
| 3:15:39| it's much murkier about exactly who, you know, the executive secretary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=11739)|
| 3:15:44| of civil service is supposed to report to in performing those functions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=11744)|
| 3:15:48| You know, some directors in the past have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=11748)|
| 3:15:50| said that they had a very clear understanding that they in effect should| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=11750)|
| 3:15:54| report to the mayor when it comes to those things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=11754)|
| 3:15:57| But that's sort of their own their own| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=11757)|
| 3:16:00| recognition of how to best perform that role.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=11760)|
| 3:16:03| There are places in the code today where a role, a function is assigned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=11763)|
| 3:16:08| specifically to the executive secretary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=11768)|
| 3:16:10| And so you could reasonably argue there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=11770)|
| 3:16:12| that because it's been assigned specifically to that position,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=11772)|
| 3:16:15| it's not really the board at all that's performing that role.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=11775)|
| 3:16:19| And, you know, there have been at least at least one board member who's expressed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=11779)|
| 3:16:23| concern that there are places where the board can't go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=11783)|
| 3:16:27| You know, they can't involve themselves| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=11787)|
| 3:16:29| because it's been assigned specifically to the executive secretary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=11789)|
| 3:16:34| And so if that position is not reporting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=11794)|
| 3:16:36| to the mayor and is not reporting to the board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=11796)|
| 3:16:38| then it's hard to identify to whom it might be reporting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=11798)|
| 3:16:42| And that's part of the reason that this ordinance is designed to make clear what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=11802)|
| 3:16:47| is done by which function so that there's clarity for all concerned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=11807)|
| 3:16:52| Just to your point, Vice Mayor, we're not going to start from a vacuum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=11812)|
| 3:16:56| All the rules for HR that currently exist will continue to exist if we create a new| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=11816)|
| 3:17:01| HR, but we can innovate and we can be more nimble as we choose to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=11821)|
| 3:17:07| explore other ways to attract and retain and recruit and be the modern| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=11827)|
| 3:17:13| twenty first century employers that we want to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=11833)|
| 3:17:16| And I think training our managers is a big element that isn't happening now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=11836)|
| 3:17:21| That would be a big bonus to doing this as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=11841)|
| 3:17:27| OK, Miss Parker and then Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=11847)|
| 3:17:29| Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=11849)|
| 3:17:31| I just want to bring up a concern that I haven't heard mentioned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=11851)|
| 3:17:37| There are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=11857)|
| 3:17:40| You know, there are different groups of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=11860)|
| 3:17:42| employees that do not serve at the pleasure of the mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=11862)|
| 3:17:47| And since being on council, when I'm reaching out for information,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=11867)|
| 3:17:54| you know, I've had a chance to reach out to those reporting directly to the mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=11874)|
| 3:17:59| I've had a chance to reach out to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=11879)|
| 3:18:03| civil service department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=11883)|
| 3:18:06| and then also city employees who are not under the mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=11886)|
| 3:18:11| And there's a clear distinction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=11891)|
| 3:18:14| on the type of information you're going to get back from those different entities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=11894)|
| 3:18:21| When you interact with the Civil Service| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=11901)|
| 3:18:23| Merit Board and their staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=11903)|
| 3:18:27| they are very much by the book.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=11907)|
| 3:18:30| And I appreciate the clarity that comes from them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=11910)|
| 3:18:35| When you speak with someone who reports| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=11915)|
| 3:18:37| directly to the mayor, they are very much working to uphold the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=11917)|
| 3:18:43| priorities of the mayor rather than get you the information that you need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=11923)|
| 3:18:47| There's a very clear distinction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=11927)|
| 3:18:50| And it hasn't been clear to me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=11930)|
| 3:18:54| why the mayor is unable to get information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=11934)|
| 3:18:58| from employees who do not serve at her pleasure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=11938)|
| 3:19:02| I've heard employees of the Civil Service| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=11942)|
| 3:19:06| Department say that they're very willing to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=11946)|
| 3:19:11| work with the mayor on certain issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=11951)|
| 3:19:13| If if she needs information from them, they'll produce it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=11953)|
| 3:19:19| And, you know, they would welcome greater| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=11959)|
| 3:19:22| capacity to expand the work that they're able to do around recruitment, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=11962)|
| 3:19:28| And so just, you know, through the through the conversations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=11968)|
| 3:19:31| it has not been clear to me that a whole new department is needed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=11971)|
| 3:19:37| during a pandemic, during a budget crunch| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=11977)|
| 3:19:41| in order to carry out any of the work that's been lifted up throughout these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=11981)|
| 3:19:46| conversations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=11986)|
| 3:19:48| And, you know, I hesitate with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=11988)|
| 3:19:53| with expanding those powers under the mayor, because I believe that the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=11993)|
| 3:20:00| the role of the Civil Service Department and the merit board is a blessing for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=12000)|
| 3:20:06| city, and I have really appreciated being able to get clear,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=12006)|
| 3:20:13| just matter of fact, information from no agenda attached.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=12013)|
| 3:20:19| And that's my concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=12019)|
| 3:20:22| Thank you, Miss Parker, Mr. Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=12022)|
| 3:20:25| You have a few questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=12025)|
| 3:20:27| One is related to budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=12027)|
| 3:20:32| You know, we've learned we've heard that the reason that a lot of these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=12032)|
| 3:20:36| responsibilities were shifted to this civil service| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=12036)|
| 3:20:40| merit board were for budgetary reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=12040)|
| 3:20:43| So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=12043)|
| 3:20:44| that implies an assumption that by creating an HR department that beyond the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=12044)|
| 3:20:50| initial hires, it will be more cost burdensome long term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=12050)|
| 3:20:55| Can you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=12055)|
| 3:20:56| I was actually because I'm not sure how| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=12056)|
| 3:20:58| many positions civil service had in the 80s when this transfer happened,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=12058)|
| 3:21:02| whether it's more or less.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=12062)|
| 3:21:03| But you know, what is expensive is losing highly trained people to other cities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=12063)|
| 3:21:08| And what also is expensive is when you have when you can't recruit people and you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=12068)|
| 3:21:12| can't retain people. So when that change was made on the basis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=12072)|
| 3:21:16| of budget, we had no problem getting people to apply to work in the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=12076)|
| 3:21:22| And that's a different environment now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=12082)|
| 3:21:24| And that's why it's important to invest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=12084)|
| 3:21:26| in our in an HR department so we can rectify that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=12086)|
| 3:21:30| So.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=12090)|
| 3:21:33| So you think beyond the specific folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=12093)|
| 3:21:35| doing the specific duties on the whole, we lose out or.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=12095)|
| 3:21:42| But anyway, it's kind of foolish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=12102)|
| 3:21:44| Yeah, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=12104)|
| 3:21:46| when we put I know really good people who are in the peak of their career,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=12106)|
| 3:21:50| we've spent thousands of dollars training them with the police or fire or general| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=12110)|
| 3:21:55| government and they leave and that's not a good stewardship of taxpayer dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=12115)|
| 3:22:01| We have to and I think an HR department will really help with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=12121)|
| 3:22:06| So the budget, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=12126)|
| 3:22:08| the city of Knoxville budget in the 1980s is really different from right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=12128)|
| 3:22:12| I mean, they also got out of the school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=12132)|
| 3:22:14| business and they're just struggling to make ends meet altogether.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=12134)|
| 3:22:18| So it was a very extenuating and different circumstances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=12138)|
| 3:22:21| I know we have our own set of challenging circumstances right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=12141)|
| 3:22:25| That's why I'm not asking for a budget change at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=12145)|
| 3:22:27| These two positions are already budgeted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=12147)|
| 3:22:29| I know we can get it done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=12149)|
| 3:22:31| with the cooperation of the current civil service staff, which, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=12151)|
| 3:22:36| are stellar hard workers who care about our employees and also with all the people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=12156)|
| 3:22:41| working out in various departments who are doing this work already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=12161)|
| 3:22:46| My second question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=12166)|
| 3:22:49| well, let me preface this over over the many, many, many hours of listening,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=12169)|
| 3:22:54| employees here and having phone calls, watching meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=12174)|
| 3:22:59| I feel like it's important to understand what we all or at least what the consensus| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=12179)|
| 3:23:04| I've heard on what is agreed upon, which is the desire for the city as a whole| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=12184)|
| 3:23:10| collectively to pursue talent, train and provide career path, train advancement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=12190)|
| 3:23:20| We all I think everybody agrees that that needs more support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=12200)|
| 3:23:24| I think the disagreement comes with who does that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=12204)|
| 3:23:26| And I think you feel like you're makes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=12206)|
| 3:23:29| more sense for the administration to do that as opposed to civil service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=12209)|
| 3:23:32| And I think civil service probably feels| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=12212)|
| 3:23:34| like they can do some some of those things that I would like civil service to continue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=12214)|
| 3:23:38| to hold us accountable for sure, all those mayor protections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=12218)|
| 3:23:43| So that so that and I think to quote a former mayor, reasonable people can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=12223)|
| 3:23:47| disagree. So I think all of those I think I kind of understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=12227)|
| 3:23:53| the kind of underlying concern I hear from most employees that I'd like to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=12233)|
| 3:23:58| maybe have Mr. Shields weigh in on is the monitoring role as established by the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=12238)|
| 3:24:03| charter for the civil service merit for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=12243)|
| 3:24:07| If I may cut to the chase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=12247)|
| 3:24:11| In no uncertain terms, employees have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=12251)|
| 3:24:13| shared concern that an HR department will allow executives within the administration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=12253)|
| 3:24:20| to have undue influence on who they think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=12260)|
| 3:24:25| should be hired for exposition within the administration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=12265)|
| 3:24:29| And so that can't happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=12269)|
| 3:24:32| And I know I'm not suggesting it would under this administration, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=12272)|
| 3:24:36| regardless of what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=12276)|
| 3:24:39| department takes care of hiring or has control over processes associated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=12279)|
| 3:24:45| with hiring, we're dealing with humans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=12285)|
| 3:24:48| And so there is undue influence and biases built into that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=12288)|
| 3:24:53| And| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=12293)|
| 3:24:56| to be specific, employees are concerned that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=12296)|
| 3:25:00| people will be hired based on their relationship| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=12300)|
| 3:25:04| with the mayor or other leaders within the administration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=12304)|
| 3:25:10| So this isn't a character question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=12310)|
| 3:25:12| It is more a process question of within| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=12312)|
| 3:25:15| the charter, the monitoring role of the civil service is important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=12315)|
| 3:25:20| And so I'd like to hear the process as it relates to that monitoring role when| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=12320)|
| 3:25:26| one employee feels like that is happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=12326)|
| 3:25:31| So maybe, Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=12331)|
| 3:25:33| Shields, describe what happens now and if anything changes with an HR department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=12333)|
| 3:25:38| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=12338)|
| 3:25:40| So so what happens now is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=12340)|
| 3:25:43| basically virtually everything happens in civil service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=12343)|
| 3:25:46| Civil service defines what the jobs are through the classification plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=12346)|
| 3:25:52| which you might think of as sort of the master list of jobs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=12352)|
| 3:25:55| you know, the titles, the duties, the qualifications, that sort of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=12355)|
| 3:25:59| And then once those jobs are defined, civil service posts vacancies to fill them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=12359)|
| 3:26:05| Civil service receives the applications| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=12365)|
| 3:26:07| from those who who might want to fill them and then conducts whatever screening| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=12367)|
| 3:26:11| process is necessary to determine whether they're eligible based| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=12371)|
| 3:26:15| on whatever the requirements of the job are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=12375)|
| 3:26:18| Some of that involves pre-employment health and health screenings and drug| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=12378)|
| 3:26:24| testing and that sort of thing, and then other aspects of it are just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=12384)|
| 3:26:28| evaluating qualifications at the at the end of that step.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=12388)|
| 3:26:32| The list of those who are eligible is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=12392)|
| 3:26:34| provided to the director of the department because it's ultimately| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=12394)|
| 3:26:38| the director that's the hiring authority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=12398)|
| 3:26:41| The director takes that list and then can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=12401)|
| 3:26:43| conduct interviews, can meet with people, that sort of thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=12403)|
| 3:26:47| and selects, generally speaking, off of the list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=12407)|
| 3:26:50| There's a way to select someone not on the list or further down on the list,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=12410)|
| 3:26:54| but generally speaking, selects from the list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=12414)|
| 3:26:57| Then that selection is returned to civil| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=12417)|
| 3:26:59| service and they certify that, yes, indeed, all procedures have been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=12419)|
| 3:27:03| completed and that person is able to start the job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=12423)|
| 3:27:07| Much of that stays exactly the same if the ordinance is enacted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=12427)|
| 3:27:11| What changes is defining what the jobs are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=12431)|
| 3:27:16| which is ultimately a management function anyway, returns to the H.R.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=12436)|
| 3:27:20| Department, which is where it used to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=12440)|
| 3:27:22| That was one of the core functions of the personnel department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=12442)|
| 3:27:25| So deciding, you know, whether we need to have a staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=12445)|
| 3:27:28| attorney or a senior staffs attorney or deputy law directors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=12448)|
| 3:27:32| you know, that sort of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=12452)|
| 3:27:33| That's a management function about how the city ought to be structured.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=12453)|
| 3:27:38| Once those decisions are made and the requirements are set,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=12458)|
| 3:27:42| even under the ordinance, civil service then steps back in because civil service| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=12462)|
| 3:27:46| is there to make sure that applicants are fairly treated as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=12466)|
| 3:27:50| part of requesting to fill one of those jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=12470)|
| 3:27:54| So to carry forward that example, if I were applying for an attorney| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=12474)|
| 3:27:58| position and if an attorney position was covered by civil service,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=12478)|
| 3:28:01| I would submit my resume just the same as under the current system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=12481)|
| 3:28:05| It would go to civil service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=12485)|
| 3:28:07| They would proceed with their process to make sure that I'm eligible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=12487)|
| 3:28:13| A slight change is that right now civil| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=12493)|
| 3:28:15| service coordinates outside appointments, you know, so the appointment to go get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=12495)|
| 3:28:19| your health screening, the appointment to go have a drug test.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=12499)|
| 3:28:22| That coordinating function moves over to H.R.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=12502)|
| 3:28:25| as part of managing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=12505)|
| 3:28:27| That's also a function that was formerly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=12507)|
| 3:28:29| performed by the personnel department, so really no change from past practice there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=12509)|
| 3:28:34| Ultimately, if I've met all the requirements to be considered for hiring,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=12514)|
| 3:28:38| it would still go to the director the same as it does today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=12518)|
| 3:28:41| The director would choose, you know, they could have H.R.'s help, though,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=12521)|
| 3:28:45| you know, maybe coming up with good interview questions or,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=12525)|
| 3:28:49| you know, whatever kind of advice a hiring director might need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=12529)|
| 3:28:52| When the director has made their decision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=12532)|
| 3:28:54| the decision goes back to civil service and civil service confirms that indeed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=12534)|
| 3:28:58| everything was done appropriately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=12538)|
| 3:29:00| So so the changes are not really the steps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=12540)|
| 3:29:04| It's more about who's performing some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=12544)|
| 3:29:07| of the steps, but the overall process looks the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=12547)|
| 3:29:09| So one last follow up and I'll try to be as specific as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=12549)|
| 3:29:14| Is it any easier for me as a director to hire someone that I would like to hire| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=12554)|
| 3:29:20| that may be less qualified because I have a relationship with them of some sort?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=12560)|
| 3:29:24| No, it's no less easier than it is today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=12564)|
| 3:29:27| That that sort of hiring would still, you know, any any hiring would have to be done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=12567)|
| 3:29:32| through the civil service recruitment process and all of those merit protection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=12572)|
| 3:29:36| steps stay with civil service to prevent something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=12576)|
| 3:29:39| And in the extremely unlikely situation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=12579)|
| 3:29:43| if somebody were to get through, you know, contrary to that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=12583)|
| 3:29:46| civil service can direct that their salary is stopped until it can be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=12586)|
| 3:29:51| investigated and resolved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=12591)|
| 3:29:53| So it's not only protections on the front| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=12593)|
| 3:29:55| end that are designed to prevent it, but there are, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=12595)|
| 3:29:58| back end remedies available if it were to ever occur.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=12598)|
| 3:30:01| OK, I don't have any more questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=12601)|
| 3:30:03| but the underlying concern I just would like to of of the over 50 people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=12603)|
| 3:30:08| employees I've spoken to about this, the underlying concern under everything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=12608)|
| 3:30:13| is a built in lack of trust for any administration, not this administration,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=12613)|
| 3:30:18| but that the right person gets the right job because they deserved it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=12618)|
| 3:30:21| not because there's an existing relationship of some sort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=12621)|
| 3:30:24| And we need to make sure that whatever| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=12624)|
| 3:30:28| processes prevent that, monitor that flag, that appeal for that stays in place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=12628)|
| 3:30:37| no matter what happens in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=12637)|
| 3:30:40| That was it. Thank you, Councilman Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=12640)|
| 3:30:42| I totally agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=12642)|
| 3:30:44| I wouldn't I mean, regardless of who's mayor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=12644)|
| 3:30:47| it may be in the future, but patronage, nepotism,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=12647)|
| 3:30:50| hiring people for reasons other than merit are not allowed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=12650)|
| 3:30:55| They're not allowed now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=12655)|
| 3:30:56| The Civil Service Merit Board is responsible for monitoring that now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=12656)|
| 3:30:59| And they'll remain responsible when whoever's doing the HR function,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=12659)|
| 3:31:04| Civil Service Merit Board's job is to make sure that things don't happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=12664)|
| 3:31:07| So I'm committed to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=12667)|
| 3:31:09| I know that there are some people who still have some trust issues, but I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=12669)|
| 3:31:13| the the language in the law and the charter and in the proposed ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=12673)|
| 3:31:18| It's not just me saying it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=12678)|
| 3:31:19| It's there written in writing, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=12679)|
| 3:31:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=12681)|
| 3:31:24| You raising your hand, Ms. Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=12684)|
| 3:31:27| Yeah, so I'm not going to come from Smith said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=12687)|
| 3:31:33| you know, I'm thinking about the ordinance nine a.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=12693)|
| 3:31:37| That was on our agenda tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=12697)|
| 3:31:40| Um,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=12700)|
| 3:31:41| until the service makes a class change, it comes before city council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=12701)|
| 3:31:49| The changes in this ordinance, would that mean?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=12709)|
| 3:31:53| When the H.R. department creates a new| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=12713)|
| 3:31:56| position, does that come before city council for approval?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=12716)|
| 3:32:01| Mr. Schultz.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=12721)|
| 3:32:03| Councilman, the answer to that is yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=12723)|
| 3:32:05| The council's role stays the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=12725)|
| 3:32:07| It's just who brings it to you that changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=12727)|
| 3:32:09| Thank you for that clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=12729)|
| 3:32:11| Councilman Roberto, did you have a comment or question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=12731)|
| 3:32:14| Yes. Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=12734)|
| 3:32:17| I was wondering, I wanted to ask Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=12737)|
| 3:32:20| King a question, Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=12740)|
| 3:32:23| King, we we've heard from the other two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=12743)|
| 3:32:26| employee groups who are supportive of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=12746)|
| 3:32:29| And I know I've heard from members of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=12749)|
| 3:32:34| of your employee organization, really, certainly on both sides of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=12754)|
| 3:32:41| But I was wondering if you could maybe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=12761)|
| 3:32:43| talk to us specifically about any of the things that you're seeing in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=12763)|
| 3:32:49| amended H.R.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=12769)|
| 3:32:52| ordinance that we're looking at tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=12772)|
| 3:32:55| Were there any specific areas that you had, you know, some concerns?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=12775)|
| 3:33:02| Mr. King.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=12782)|
| 3:33:04| Yes, thank you, Mayor Steve King, president of the City Employees Association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=12784)|
| 3:33:10| I think the overriding concern of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=12790)|
| 3:33:14| employees are number one, like I mentioned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=12794)|
| 3:33:21| the opinion of Mike Winchester, the civil service mayor board attorney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=12801)|
| 3:33:25| Outlined multiple concerns, and that's why the mayor board voted to oppose the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=12805)|
| 3:33:33| ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=12813)|
| 3:33:35| Many of the things that my fellow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=12815)|
| 3:33:38| employees, both.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=12818)|
| 3:33:41| General government and police and fire| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=12821)|
| 3:33:43| have mentioned have to do with compensation, and I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=12823)|
| 3:33:48| council knows and I think we all know that the the city mayor and council have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=12828)|
| 3:33:56| control of compensation, they also have control of if if you want to put| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=12836)|
| 3:34:02| if you want more training on a variety of things that can be funded| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=12842)|
| 3:34:07| in a various number of ways through my tenure with the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=12847)|
| 3:34:12| I've seen civil service staff actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=12852)|
| 3:34:14| decrease, but it seems that they're being criticized now for not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=12854)|
| 3:34:20| fulfilling some some functions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=12860)|
| 3:34:23| I'm sure that just like in engineering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=12863)|
| 3:34:28| through the years, we have had to if we if we have a hard time finding a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=12868)|
| 3:34:33| chief traffic engineer and we want to publish an ad in the.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=12873)|
| 3:34:37| Institute of Transportation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=12877)|
| 3:34:39| engineering magazine, we have to pay for that ourself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=12879)|
| 3:34:43| So and that's not a problem with civil| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=12883)|
| 3:34:46| service, that's because funding is not there to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=12886)|
| 3:34:50| So I think some of the things that we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=12890)|
| 3:34:53| talking about doing can be done in a variety of ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=12893)|
| 3:34:56| But I guess your question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=12896)|
| 3:34:59| Councilman Roberto, relates to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=12899)|
| 3:35:02| And I understand you're getting mixed signals from various employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=12902)|
| 3:35:08| I think the employees that you hear| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=12908)|
| 3:35:10| supporting this see increased compensation, increased training down the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=12910)|
| 3:35:17| And I guess my point is, I'm concerned about Mike Winchester's opinion and his| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=12917)|
| 3:35:23| concerns, but I think that the compensation and the training could be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=12923)|
| 3:35:29| handled in either the civil service mode or the HR mode.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=12929)|
| 3:35:34| I'm just focused on why is our civil| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=12934)|
| 3:35:37| service merit board attorney so concerned about the proposal?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=12937)|
| 3:35:45| OK, thank you, Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=12945)|
| 3:35:46| King, for elaborating on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=12946)|
| 3:35:51| You know, I think the amended version that we have in front of us today after| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=12951)|
| 3:35:57| the workshop is certainly a much better ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=12957)|
| 3:36:02| And so I definitely| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=12962)|
| 3:36:04| applaud that some of those changes have been made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=12964)|
| 3:36:09| Some of the some of the language still troubles me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=12969)|
| 3:36:13| You know, I still have some concerns about the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=12973)|
| 3:36:17| you know, increase in executive authority here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=12977)|
| 3:36:23| So, you know, I'm hearing conflicting things from employee groups and I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=12983)|
| 3:36:30| hearing positive things and I'm hearing negative concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=12990)|
| 3:36:33| And I think there's been a lot of work done on this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=12993)|
| 3:36:38| You know, I ultimately I don't think I can support this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=12998)|
| 3:36:42| I think that it's it's a big improvement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=13002)|
| 3:36:46| But some of the language is so, so, so concerns me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=13006)|
| 3:36:50| But I think it has a lot of merit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=13010)|
| 3:36:52| And I think even Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=13012)|
| 3:36:54| King was talking about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=13014)|
| 3:36:55| There's a lot of merit here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=13015)|
| 3:36:57| for doing for having HR.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=13017)|
| 3:36:59| There's a lot of good reasons for doing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=13019)|
| 3:37:01| Some of the specifics just just, you know, I just can't get comfortable with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=13021)|
| 3:37:08| Thank you, Mr. Roberto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=13028)|
| 3:37:09| Miss Roger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=13029)|
| 3:37:12| So we've been contacted by a lot of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=13032)|
| 3:37:14| employees and I I'm pretty I feel like I've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=13034)|
| 3:37:20| heard from more employees that were in support of this than those who are not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=13040)|
| 3:37:26| And one of the comments from one of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=13046)|
| 3:37:30| speakers were about where our loyalties lie, and I want to address that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=13050)|
| 3:37:37| I think I can speak for them for for most of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=13057)|
| 3:37:40| I don't speak for myself, not put words in anyone's mouth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=13060)|
| 3:37:42| But, you know, my loyalties lie with the taxpayers, the employees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=13062)|
| 3:37:49| the directors, the supervisors, as well as the mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=13069)|
| 3:37:52| Loyalties can't lie with one direction and us expect this to work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=13072)|
| 3:37:57| as a functional government, we rely| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=13077)|
| 3:38:02| on the employees and their work with their supervisors and their directors to get the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=13082)|
| 3:38:08| issues taken care of that our constituents, the taxpayers ask for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=13088)|
| 3:38:12| whether that's dead animal pickup or pothole filling or, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=13092)|
| 3:38:18| repaving a road, there's or protections, fire protection, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=13098)|
| 3:38:23| There's a lot of things the taxpayer, the constituent is asking for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=13103)|
| 3:38:28| And, you know, I've worked with city employees as a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=13108)|
| 3:38:32| constituent since 2005, since I arrived in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=13112)|
| 3:38:36| And I've had the opportunity to meet and get to know a lot of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=13116)|
| 3:38:40| I spent a good eight years on neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=13120)|
| 3:38:43| advisory council and got to meet a lot of department heads and employees through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=13123)|
| 3:38:49| that process, and I've seen a lot of great work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=13129)|
| 3:38:52| And I've heard a lot of I've had employees long before I was on council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=13132)|
| 3:38:58| complain, complain about their job, complain about their supervisor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=13138)|
| 3:39:01| complain about lack of opportunity, and I think we focused on a lot of that here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=13141)|
| 3:39:06| I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=13146)|
| 3:39:09| There is one thing that really sticks out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=13149)|
| 3:39:11| to me in listening to a lot of the breaking down of this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=13151)|
| 3:39:17| number one, we're we're getting into some of the nitty gritty that hasn't been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=13157)|
| 3:39:20| determined, but what I see, the essence of this is a need to uncouple.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=13160)|
| 3:39:26| I see an unnatural fit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=13166)|
| 3:39:28| to these functions of human resources or personnel with civil service,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=13168)|
| 3:39:34| civil service there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=13174)|
| 3:39:36| which Mr. King is very familiar with, is something that employees have there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=13176)|
| 3:39:41| to protect them and protect them in their jobs and protect them from unfair management| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=13181)|
| 3:39:48| or nepotism, you know, and the process of hiring whoever| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=13188)|
| 3:39:53| you want so that there's a fair and balanced process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=13193)|
| 3:39:58| With these things coupled together,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=13198)|
| 3:40:00| you're saying you get to determine and suggest the compensation, the classes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=13200)|
| 3:40:06| the processes, and then when I don't agree with something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=13206)|
| 3:40:10| you're also the body, the group civil service that I come and file my complaint with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=13210)|
| 3:40:15| Then you also get to be the judge to decide if my complaint is merited and fair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=13215)|
| 3:40:21| And it's completely unnatural that these things be coupled together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=13221)|
| 3:40:26| And I've not seen that in places where.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=13226)|
| 3:40:29| I have worked before and I've had to do that where I say, hey,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=13229)|
| 3:40:33| this process where you get raped or merited isn't working and it's not being| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=13233)|
| 3:40:38| administered correctly, I go to my HR department and ask for assistance with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=13238)|
| 3:40:43| That's the way it works and where I'm at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=13243)|
| 3:40:46| I don't it just is not working that they're they're coupled together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=13246)|
| 3:40:50| And so that is why I feel like this is the right move.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=13250)|
| 3:40:53| And that's what I'm hearing from the many| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=13253)|
| 3:40:54| employees that are asking for this and support and some of them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=13254)|
| 3:40:58| I've known of and have interacted with, and they've been very loyal to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=13258)|
| 3:41:03| constituents and the taxpayers since I first got here and I've met them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=13263)|
| 3:41:07| I've seen lots of people retire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=13267)|
| 3:41:10| I think it's astounding and says a lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=13270)|
| 3:41:12| for the many employees that have stayed with the city for as long as they have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=13272)|
| 3:41:17| But I think that we can do better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=13277)|
| 3:41:19| And this is just an unnatural coupling| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=13279)|
| 3:41:22| that needs to come back for the best and most fair thing for the employees and for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=13282)|
| 3:41:26| the supervisors and theirs to grow and focus on things like retention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=13286)|
| 3:41:30| So that's why I think after listening to all the meetings the mayor has had and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=13290)|
| 3:41:35| from all the feedback from the employees and watching the progress of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=13295)|
| 3:41:42| the redlining and changes that have worked its way in, this is a much better| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=13302)|
| 3:41:47| ordinance and has addressed a lot of concerns that I feel competent in supporting it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=13307)|
| 3:41:53| Thank you, Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=13313)|
| 3:41:54| And Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=13314)|
| 3:41:54| Sherman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=13314)|
| 3:41:59| You got on you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=13319)|
| 3:42:02| Same as the rest of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=13322)|
| 3:42:05| my colleagues across I've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=13325)|
| 3:42:09| sat in on the Civil Service Merit Board board meeting, as well as the different| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=13329)|
| 3:42:14| employee workshops that were held or our workshop and then as well as the other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=13334)|
| 3:42:23| sessions to just listen to all the different the different sides as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=13343)|
| 3:42:30| You know, I have a pretty decent amount| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=13350)|
| 3:42:31| of experience, both with corporate and small business where HR is concerned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=13351)|
| 3:42:37| And| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=13357)|
| 3:42:38| as with any large business, my experience has been that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=13358)|
| 3:42:43| HR is critical to the success of of, you know, any organization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=13363)|
| 3:42:50| And it's needed and it covers so many different functions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=13370)|
| 3:42:54| And, you know, it's already been stated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=13374)|
| 3:42:56| that, you know, recruitment, marketing and talent acquisition are currently done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=13376)|
| 3:43:01| outside the Civil Service Merit Board, it's already happening outside of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=13381)|
| 3:43:05| And it's for my opinion, those three things are critical to remain together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=13385)|
| 3:43:11| And in addition, there's so many other components to HR.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=13391)|
| 3:43:15| So whether it's orientation, onboarding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=13395)|
| 3:43:18| you know, but I think I think the goal, or at least, you know, in my opinion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=13398)|
| 3:43:23| HR provides so many resources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=13403)|
| 3:43:26| And I do think that we need to raise the game and up our standard for employees to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=13406)|
| 3:43:31| give them the tools that they need to be successful and provide training, learning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=13411)|
| 3:43:37| and development, career opportunities that are really going to benefit our city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=13417)|
| 3:43:43| And I think, you know, yeah, turnover is costly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=13423)|
| 3:43:46| I think four billion dollars a year is spent on turnover.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=13426)|
| 3:43:49| And most of that, you know, are on orientation and onboarding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=13429)|
| 3:43:53| But a lot of that's lost on day one if you don't do it well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=13433)|
| 3:43:57| And, you know, the biggest thing that I see, too, is human resources is so pivotal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=13437)|
| 3:44:04| and needs to be embedded boots on the ground day to day in the operations of the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=13444)|
| 3:44:14| And especially as it goes towards strategic planning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=13454)|
| 3:44:18| that the administration does moving forward, enable, you know, to enable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=13458)|
| 3:44:24| you know, the administration to determine what the needs are moving forward from an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=13464)|
| 3:44:29| HR perspective and compensation is key.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=13469)|
| 3:44:32| We've talked about that again, but we so we want to be competitive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=13472)|
| 3:44:37| And that's where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=13477)|
| 3:44:39| compensation becomes critical and needs to be needs to be, you know, a conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=13479)|
| 3:44:47| So, you know, I support I think it just it's cohesive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=13487)|
| 3:44:52| There's not, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=13492)|
| 3:44:54| organized that there's not an organization out there that I know of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=13494)|
| 3:44:58| small, large, global, local that, you know, doesn't have an HR presence on a daily| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=13498)|
| 3:45:04| basis in order to really raise the standard and put in place, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=13504)|
| 3:45:10| best practices and moving forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=13510)|
| 3:45:13| So I that's my.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=13513)|
| 3:45:17| That's my feeling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=13517)|
| 3:45:18| Thank you, Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=13518)|
| 3:45:19| Sherman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=13519)|
| 3:45:22| Vice Mayor, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=13522)|
| 3:45:24| Yes, I know I've heard us talk about recruitment quite a bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=13524)|
| 3:45:29| So by charter, can we move recruitment from civil service to HR?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=13529)|
| 3:45:34| Does anybody, Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=13534)|
| 3:45:36| Shields?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=13536)|
| 3:45:37| Vice Mayor, the answer to that is in part| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=13537)|
| 3:45:41| we have to first define what we mean by recruitment and what Dr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=13541)|
| 3:45:45| Hatfield has suggested recruitment means under the charter is that core hosting of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=13545)|
| 3:45:51| job vacancies and accepting of application step, because that's where the merit is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=13551)|
| 3:45:56| most critical, you know, to make sure your application is properly processed and that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=13556)|
| 3:46:00| as a result of processing it, that, you know, a proper list is generated for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=13560)|
| 3:46:05| directors to choose from to make sure that those folks have been fairly treated on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=13565)|
| 3:46:09| that entry point, what recruitment does not necessarily mean and what what is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=13569)|
| 3:46:14| already in practice throughout the city is the more active talent acquisition step,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=13574)|
| 3:46:19| the marketing, you know, the going to job fairs, the developing of recruiting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=13579)|
| 3:46:24| materials, you know, the more outside the four corners of the of the city building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=13584)|
| 3:46:29| you know, sorts of steps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=13589)|
| 3:46:31| And that's where an HR department could really, I think, pay dividends because much| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=13591)|
| 3:46:36| of that is happening on a department by department basis, but not on a citywide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=13596)|
| 3:46:41| basis. So the ordinance, the ordinance leaves the core aspects of recruitment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=13601)|
| 3:46:45| you know, those posting steps and those accepting applications and processing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=13605)|
| 3:46:49| steps leaves that with civil service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=13609)|
| 3:46:51| But the going out and broadcasting the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=13611)|
| 3:46:54| as an employer of choice that moves over to HR because it just hasn't been done in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=13614)|
| 3:46:58| a centralized way before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=13618)|
| 3:47:01| So I think what I hear you saying is marketing recruitment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=13621)|
| 3:47:06| Would go to HR, but the paper processing part of it would say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=13626)|
| 3:47:13| recruitment would still stay in civil service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=13633)|
| 3:47:17| That's exactly right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=13637)|
| 3:47:18| From the point you decide to apply for the job and submit your application,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=13638)|
| 3:47:22| that's happening with civil service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=13642)|
| 3:47:24| Everything that leads to making that decision to apply for the job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=13644)|
| 3:47:27| That's something HR would be able to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=13647)|
| 3:47:33| OK, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=13653)|

| 3:48:24| The best way for me to give those numbers to her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=13704)|

| 3:59:03| sign that said variance out past my driveway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=14343)|
| 3:59:08| And that's when I called and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=14348)|
| 3:59:11| knew that what had been in place in the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=14351)|
| 3:59:16| The trucking company and the land for me is concerning because of the land's history.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=14356)|
| 3:59:25| I know that it has had three failed soil| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=14365)|
| 3:59:27| testings and they're going to build the trucking company on the land, even though it failed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=14367)|

| 3:59:39| spoken with many workers out here on the land, they're going to dig all of the things up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=14379)|
| 3:59:46| The things that were dumped on that land to see my make it flat in the front| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=14386)|
| 3:59:53| was done around the I'm going to say between ninety five and ninety eight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=14393)|
| 4:00:01| I know the person who did the dumping and there was probably between two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=14401)|
| 4:00:07| hundred to three hundred dump trucks, and that was because it was my family| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=14407)|
| 4:00:12| member that had a trucking dump truck business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=14412)|
| 4:00:16| The person who owned it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=14416)|
| 4:00:19| has gotten he's passed away and I'm not by any means disrespectful toward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=14419)|
| 4:00:27| him at all. Just while he was alive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=14427)|
| 4:00:31| he was moving a lot of dirt in the land closer to the creek,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=14431)|
| 4:00:38| which he got fined twice in doing so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=14438)|
| 4:00:43| But however, there was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=14443)|
| 4:00:46| his company was Fairfax Construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=14446)|
| 4:00:48| And so a tremendous amount of asphalt, a tremendous amount of concrete,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=14448)|
| 4:00:54| anything left over from each subdivision build or home build that they did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=14454)|
| 4:01:00| We entered this land to make it flat and a large portion of that was toward the creek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=14460)|
| 4:01:08| So whenever he was moving all of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=14468)|
| 4:01:11| it went closer to where it would be a floodplain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=14471)|
| 4:01:17| And then he got too close to the creek and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=14477)|
| 4:01:21| I'm not sure I call it EPA, but that's not what you call it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=14481)|
| 4:01:24| There is an environmental person in our that's assigned to our district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=14484)|
| 4:01:30| happened to see him and drive by on his way home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=14490)|
| 4:01:33| And| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=14493)|
| 4:01:36| so I know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=14496)|
| 4:01:38| That he got fines, I know that he that I'm not sure whether or not he even had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=14498)|
| 4:01:45| a permit to do that, I know that they want to take that up because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=14505)|
| 4:01:49| of the failed soil testings and that they're going to have to in order so that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=14509)|
| 4:01:52| the buildings don't sink.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=14512)|
| 4:01:56| But it bothers me that it's so close to the floodplain and it's so close to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=14516)|
| 4:02:02| the creek area, which obviously travels through my lands and it's in front| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=14522)|
| 4:02:08| of me and it's concerning for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=14528)|
| 4:02:13| You know, what is actually in the land,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=14533)|
| 4:02:17| how do you have one minute left?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=14537)|
| 4:02:20| So I kind of would like to have maybe like a pause button somewhere,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=14540)|
| 4:02:26| and I'm not sure how to do that to see if we can get an environmental| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=14546)|
| 4:02:30| service to come check the land for the dumping site and whether or not that was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=14550)|
| 4:02:39| legal or illegal to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=14559)|
| 4:02:42| And I'm not really sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=14562)|
| 4:02:44| How to do that or what to do with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=14564)|
| 4:02:48| And what they're going to find when they do do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=14568)|

| 4:03:30| I purchased this house when I was twenty three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=14610)|
| 4:03:32| And over the last 16 years, I've written the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=14612)|
| 4:03:35| the state, the feds trying to clean up Mechanicsville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=14615)|

| 4:15:35| But is it going to actually give us what we need?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=15335)|
| 4:15:38| And the answer for Knoxville actually is no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=15338)|

| 4:17:15| community relations is to expand this to establish| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=15435)|
| 4:17:21| a youth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=15441)|

| 4:18:16| familiar with her when she comes to public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=15496)|
| 4:18:19| And I know she's made me feel like I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=15499)|
| 4:18:21| personally responsible for 400 years of oppression.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=15501)|
| 4:18:26| But when it really counted, she stepped up and said the right thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=15506)|
| 4:18:30| And I'm really, really proud of her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=15510)|

| 4:18:48| And to be honest, I know my address is very clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=15528)|
| 4:18:51| I am from Knoxville, Tennessee, born and raised from here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=15531)|
| 4:18:54| So no need for the address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=15534)|
| 4:18:55| I came here today because it was understood we had some very direct| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=15535)|
| 4:19:01| demands from our protests.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=15541)|
| 4:19:03| Number one, the body cameras is a must.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=15543)|
| 4:19:06| It's not negotiable at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=15546)|
| 4:19:08| Number two, the mental health, it is also a must.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=15548)|
| 4:19:11| It's been non-negotiable at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=15551)|
| 4:19:13| And number three, the empowerment of part fully subpoena power,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=15553)|
| 4:19:18| community oversight, true direct community oversight in direct| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=15558)|
| 4:19:22| communication with that leadership board and the director and that being| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=15562)|
| 4:19:25| communicated properly with the chief of police and the different variations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=15565)|
| 4:19:29| of chain of command, these things are non-negotiable at this point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=15569)|
| 4:19:34| because as I've already expressed and as I expressed at the rally,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=15574)|
| 4:19:37| George Floyd is every African-American in this country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=15577)|
| 4:19:41| It doesn't matter where we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=15581)|
| 4:19:42| It is the same threat that exists| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=15582)|
| 4:19:44| between African-Americans and the police department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=15584)|
| 4:19:47| Philly Phelps and Dylan Williams was just last summer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=15587)|
| 4:19:51| We are not going to tolerate a Philly Phelps this summer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=15591)|
| 4:19:54| And matter of fact, if anything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=15594)|
| 4:19:55| it will become and deemed inexcusable and negligent at this point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=15595)|
| 4:20:00| because every single council member that is sitting on this council is aware| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=15600)|
| 4:20:04| of that situation, whether he was here on council at the time or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=15604)|
| 4:20:07| It's no secret that took place in our city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=15607)|
| 4:20:10| Now, today I had a meeting with the police of chief and Mayor Kincaid| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=15610)|
| 4:20:16| and I will openly state that in that meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=15616)|
| 4:20:18| Chief Thomas was very receptive to the format changes that we are requesting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=15618)|
| 4:20:24| However, Indican Canada, out of her own mouth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=15624)|
| 4:20:27| when I asked her for a commitment to the social service changes been added| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=15627)|
| 4:20:31| for employment, she flat out denied that request,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=15631)|
| 4:20:34| saying that she could not put social paid workers on staff over police officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=15634)|
| 4:20:40| However, Knoxville lacks no police forces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=15640)|
| 4:20:43| We have the KPD.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=15643)|
| 4:20:45| We have the sheriff department and we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=15645)|
| 4:20:47| the Tennessee Highway Patrol present in our communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=15647)|
| 4:20:50| And if you live in black communities and you dial 9-1-1,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=15650)|
| 4:20:53| you know that all three of these police forces are probable to respond to a call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=15653)|
| 4:20:58| So we don't lack police.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=15658)|
| 4:21:00| What we lack is mental health experts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=15660)|
| 4:21:03| And in that meeting today, we expressed that mental health is a holistic approach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=15663)|
| 4:21:07| We're not just saying put mental health| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=15667)|
| 4:21:08| experts on staff for the community and going out and responding with the officers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=15668)|
| 4:21:12| to call. We said we want our police officers who have been deemed overworked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=15672)|
| 4:21:17| and been machine ran as well, a necessity of meeting that mental health.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=15677)|
| 4:21:21| As a veteran of this country, I am fully aware of the necessity of mental health.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=15681)|
| 4:21:26| Daily combative environment where you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200602?start=15686)|
