| 2:12:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=7951)|
| 2:12:32| Mr. McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=7952)|
| 2:12:33| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=7953)|
| 2:12:34| I'm privy to this process a lot in my day job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=7954)|
| 2:12:38| So I think Mr. Smith is absolutely correct, you probably need to dig into it a little| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=7958)|
| 2:12:46| deeper if you have concerns at face value about what Mr. Larry says or what we, you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=7966)|
| 2:12:51| know, compared to other schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=7971)|
| 2:12:54| Let me address a couple of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=7974)|
| 2:12:57| In terms of operating this building, if we threw away PBA tomorrow, we still have operational costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=7977)|
| 2:13:06| And operational costs, what's the square footage of this facility?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=7986)|
| 2:13:09| It's right at a half million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=7989)|
| 2:13:11| Half million square feet, probably 30 conference rooms, gobs of offices, everyone wanting to be comfortable 365 days a year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=7991)|
| 2:13:23| everyone wanting that plumbing to flush each time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=8003)|
| 2:13:26| We're talking about massive amounts of facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=8006)|
| 2:13:31| This is a complicated, expensive facility, and as it ages, you need to be responsible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=8011)|
| 2:13:37| So it's not just running to the clogged toilet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=8017)|
| 2:13:41| It's doing preventive maintenance on equipment, changing out huge pumps and motors every two years, changing out belts on a cycle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=8021)|
| 2:13:52| And so that requires a staffing level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=8032)|
| 2:13:55| So if we threw away PBA, you're going to have to, we're going to have to pay for those things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=8035)|
| 2:14:01| because we're not going to be able to do them with present staffing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=8041)|
| 2:14:08| So either we're going to hire all county employees, and we'll basically, what they're doing, I mean, same fringes and benefits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=8048)|
| 2:14:14| or we have to subcontract it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=8054)|
| 2:14:16| Do you do it to one person?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=8056)|
| 2:14:18| So one company out here that can do HVAC, plumbing, elevator maintenance, fire protection is huge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=8058)|
| 2:14:26| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=8066)|
| 2:14:28| Retrofitting things in this building, everything you remodel now, built in what, 70, when was this building built?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=8068)|
| 2:14:35| Yes, early 70s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=8075)|
| 2:14:37| 70s, the fire code has changed tremendously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=8077)|
| 2:14:40| So every remodel, your firewall, right, they measure the thickness, the spacing of the doors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=8080)|
| 2:14:47| You have to come back and remodel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=8087)|
| 2:14:49| So every remodel has to do all these things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=8089)|
| 2:14:51| So, again, maybe PBA is not the best.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=8091)|
| 2:14:57| Looking at the numbers, you know, it's not bad, guys, ladies and gentlemen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=8097)|
| 2:15:03| It's not bad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=8103)|
| 2:15:04| So, you know, I think we need to, I agree with them, I think we need to dig in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=8104)|
| 2:15:08| If this is something that we want to get arms around and see if the county taxpayers are being hosed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=8108)|
| 2:15:13| I think it takes us digging in a little deeper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=8113)|
| 2:15:16| And I think in the final analysis we'll find that we're doing okay in terms of, and keeping up the facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=8116)|
| 2:15:23| I mean, you know, when you think about carpet replacement, what's the cycle for that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=8123)|
| 2:15:28| It's not a small amount of money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=8128)|
| 2:15:30| People want to have clean, especially in a public building like this, we want clean restrooms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=8130)|
| 2:15:34| And, you know, my three years going in and out of this building, it's pretty good shape.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=8134)|
| 2:15:39| So that's one aspect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=8139)|
| 2:15:41| Well, let me get to the Hardin Valley piece of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=8141)|
| 2:15:46| The roughly $1 million out of 50 administrative costs, that's roughly what it looks like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=8146)|
| 2:15:55| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=8155)|
| 2:15:56| How does that compare to, and I know, well, let's go your part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=8156)|
| 2:16:00| Half a million dollars out of 50 million is, I don't know what percentage that is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=8160)|
| 2:16:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=8166)|
| 2:16:07| It's about two and a half.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=8167)|
| 2:16:08| Two and a half.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=8168)|
| 2:16:10| So it's two and a half percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=8170)|
| 2:16:12| How does that, is that competitive for?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=8172)|
| 2:16:16| I've never seen a project management fee for the role we play in the private side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=8176)|
| 2:16:26| And, of course, the percentages get higher the smaller the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=8186)|
| 2:16:33| But for a $50 million project in the private sector, the fees would normally be about 7% to 10%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=8193)|
| 2:16:39| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=8199)|
| 2:16:40| So it's, this is the first private sector job I've had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=8200)|
| 2:16:46| And I also ran projects as a private entity for MacArthur Foundation in Florida.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=8206)|
| 2:16:53| And we paid project management fees usually in the 7% to 10%, sometimes 12% or 14% range, depending on complexity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=8213)|
| 2:17:03| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=8223)|
| 2:17:04| You know, the S&S is $1.4 billion project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=8224)|
| 2:17:07| I mean, I don't think those numbers are outrageous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=8227)|
| 2:17:11| You know, and we have to admit what we dealt with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=8231)|
| 2:17:15| We didn't have, well, there's two things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=8235)|
| 2:17:19| We didn't have a clean process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=8239)|
| 2:17:21| We, very few of us were on the commission at the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=8241)|
| 2:17:24| But we remember the whole conversation about build out for $1,400 and finish it, build it out for $20.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=8244)|
| 2:17:31| We remember that process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=8251)|
| 2:17:33| Understand that things were moving during that whole time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=8253)|
| 2:17:37| So we're sitting here not making up our minds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=8257)|
| 2:17:40| But the deadline never changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=8260)|
| 2:17:42| That comes at a cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=8262)|
| 2:17:44| When the client, when you're building your house and you're like, I want it to be 2,500 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=8264)|
| 2:17:50| No, 4,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=8270)|
| 2:17:51| No, 2,500.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=8271)|
| 2:17:52| That's what we did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=8272)|
| 2:17:54| But we wanted it built by Christmas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=8274)|
| 2:17:57| So that was, the deadline did never move.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=8277)|
| 2:18:01| It never moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=8281)|
| 2:18:02| So when you do that and you play this scratch your head game, which is what our folks did, and, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=8282)|
| 2:18:09| that's maybe the wisest thing that they did because I think they made the right choice in the end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=8289)|
| 2:18:14| So doing that costs time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=8294)|
| 2:18:17| It costs resources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=8297)|
| 2:18:20| And the last comment, and then I've got a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=8300)|
| 2:18:23| The last comment is you have to go build at some point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=8303)|
| 2:18:29| You never, well, unless you've got the design build process, you never wait to 100%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=8309)|
| 2:18:34| We've got all of our I's, dot, and T's crossed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=8314)|
| 2:18:37| That's not how you do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=8317)|
| 2:18:38| The electrical thing, you've got time to work on it when we're moving dirt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=8318)|
| 2:18:42| I mean, there's no power coming into this site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=8322)|
| 2:18:45| You've got time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=8325)|
| 2:18:47| You keep working on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=8327)|
| 2:18:49| So that electrical package might be at 60%, 70% when we break ground.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=8329)|
| 2:18:55| That's just how you build facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=8335)|
| 2:18:58| You don't wait, especially, like you say, with this new process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=8338)|
| 2:19:01| I personally like the design build process as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=8341)|
| 2:19:04| I think that kind of shifts a lot of the onus on the contractor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=8344)|
| 2:19:11| So that's just, you know, that's part of doing business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=8351)|
| 2:19:14| This isn't a house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=8354)|
| 2:19:16| And even if it was a house, you are going to build out some options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=8356)|
| 2:19:19| Okay, I've been able to get this built at this level, so I want hardwood floors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=8359)|
| 2:19:25| I want to build out my bonus room that costs additional money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=8365)|
| 2:19:29| You scale it up, we're probably not too far off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=8369)|
| 2:19:33| You know, and to deal with the field house, I know Commissioner Wright can attest to, let's say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=8373)|
| 2:19:40| the issues of trying to build a field house piecemeal might be a best way to say it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=8380)|
| 2:19:48| So if we were going to build a field house, that's best to build it then and be done with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=8388)|
| 2:19:54| And I have issues with it as well, so don't take me to say that, you know, afford it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=8394)|
| 2:20:00| But once you've made a decision, Hardin Valley needs a field house, go ahead and build it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=8400)|
| 2:20:04| while you've got the trucks and the block layers on site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=8404)|
| 2:20:08| It's always going to be cheaper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=8408)|
| 2:20:10| But my question is, well, really, I'd like you to go into your last slide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=8410)|
| 2:20:16| Yeah, I didn't mean to skip that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=8416)|
| 2:20:18| I was about to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=8418)|
| 2:20:19| On your misstatements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=8419)|
| 2:20:20| Could you go into that one where you compared yourself to Granger County High School?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=8420)|
| 2:20:23| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=8423)|
| 2:20:24| Actually, the data source for this is Merritt Construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=8424)|
| 2:20:30| And specifically, their Executive VP, Steve Heatherly, gave us this data.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=8430)|
| 2:20:38| They were managing, while they were doing Hardin Valley at the same time frame,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=8438)|
| 2:20:43| they were managing the Granger County High School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=8443)|
| 2:20:47| And you can see, obviously, the square footage differences.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=8447)|
| 2:20:51| But Granger County was a design-bid-build.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=8451)|
| 2:20:55| It was the process Commissioner Anders and, I guess, to a degree, Commissioner Owen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=8455)|
| 2:21:01| we were suggesting would be better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=8461)|
| 2:21:04| Look at the cost per square foot of construction costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=8464)|
| 2:21:08| $144 a square foot for Hardin Valley, $160 on Granger County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=8468)|
| 2:21:15| And it was a hard-bid project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=8475)|
| 2:21:19| That's simply one current topical example of why I truly believe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=8479)|
| 2:21:28| and my staff believes, construction management risk is the better way to do projects,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=8488)|
| 2:21:34| particularly when you attach a deadline like August so the school can open, or July in this case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=8494)|
| 2:21:42| It's the same company, same state, obviously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=8502)|
| 2:21:48| Two different counties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=8508)|
| 2:21:51| And, you know, would the fact that Hardin Valley is 100,000 square feet bigger| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=8511)|
| 2:21:57| account for some of that cost?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=8517)|
| 2:22:00| Some, but not all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=8520)|
| 2:22:04| You know, and again, it's not a pro or a con.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=8524)|
| 2:22:09| I think we just kind of need to get some facts out there as far as, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=8529)|
| 2:22:13| Hardin Valley is a great facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=8533)|
| 2:22:16| Walking the halls, you know, and I know, I don't want to start another debate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=8536)|
| 2:22:21| but if you walk the halls of Hardin Valley and you walk the halls of some of these other high schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=8541)|
| 2:22:25| that were discussed earlier, there's a noticeable difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=8545)|
| 2:22:32| And I think 10 years down the line, there will be a noticeable difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=8552)|
| 2:22:36| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=8556)|
| 2:22:38| One example, as we were working Hardin Valley, we asked the school board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=8558)|
| 2:22:47| would they accept the interior walls being steel studs and sheetrock, like this building is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=8567)|
| 2:22:56| as opposed to the concrete block that their program requirements call for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=8576)|
| 2:23:02| And they said no, they don't, because the concrete block will hold up for decades,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=8582)|
| 2:23:07| with probably little to no repair beyond a paint job,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=8587)|
| 2:23:10| and the sheetrock obviously is more easily damaged and would raise their maintenance costs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=8590)|
| 2:23:16| and so they said no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=8596)|
| 2:23:18| But that was, you know, close to a million-dollar difference, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=8598)|
| 2:23:23| And again, they, with Mayor Ragsdale's knowledge, made that decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=8603)|
| 2:23:32| We had a similar situation when we were doing the East Tennessee Historical Center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=8612)|
| 2:23:36| a very complicated building if you've ever been completely through it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=8616)|
| 2:23:41| We could have saved a million dollars with a brick exterior as opposed to the marble exterior.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=8621)|
| 2:23:48| The brick exterior would have matched the building next to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=8628)|
| 2:23:51| Obviously, the marble matched the historical one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=8631)|
| 2:23:55| That was brought back before commission, before probably any of you were on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=8635)|
| 2:24:00| and they chose the million-dollar marble finish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=8640)|
| 2:24:04| Aesthetically, the better choice, sure, probably a million dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=8644)|
| 2:24:12| So there are decisions made like that, but I also wanted to touch on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=8652)|
| 2:24:17| because we haven't really touched much on the facility management side,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=8657)|
| 2:24:23| we have been very aggressive in trying to address the costs for facilities management.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=8663)|
| 2:24:29| I mean, we now have almost 3 million square feet of buildings we manage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=8669)|
| 2:24:34| We buy for those at the same, essentially simultaneously,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=8674)|
| 2:24:39| so there's some cost effectiveness in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=8679)|
| 2:24:42| But I brought an independent consultant in about five years ago to look at our facilities management| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=8682)|
| 2:24:50| because I already knew some things myself, but I didn't know what I didn't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=8690)|
| 2:24:56| They looked at our entire operation, told me one thing that I expected them to tell me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=8696)|
| 2:25:02| which was we were doing too little preventative maintenance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=8702)|
| 2:25:06| and too much just remedial maintenance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=8706)|
| 2:25:10| We've made a number of steps to solve that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=8710)|
| 2:25:13| We have put a computerized maintenance management system in place specifically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=8713)|
| 2:25:19| so I can make sure that no dollar of yours is going to fund city work and vice versa.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=8719)|
| 2:25:25| It's very important, obviously, that we keep very close track of my people's time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=8725)|
| 2:25:30| And frankly, you know, my average maintenance guy doesn't pay much attention| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=8730)|
| 2:25:35| if he walks out of this building and over into the old courthouse, but I need him to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=8735)|
| 2:25:39| and that system helps me keep everybody straight and narrow in terms of where they're working| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=8739)|
| 2:25:45| in a given hour of the day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=8745)|
| 2:25:48| Another example, again, I'm not really a public sector person by my life,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=8748)|
| 2:25:56| and I wondered could I do better in terms of my security costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=8756)|
| 2:26:03| And, in fact, went and tracked down Wackenhut and ultimately another company| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=8763)|
| 2:26:09| and said, I want to know if I'm cost efficient, and I want to know if you could do better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=8769)|
| 2:26:16| And instead of putting out an RFP, because then everybody gets excited| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=8776)|
| 2:26:20| and they spend time on the RFP, and if they can't do better,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=8780)|
| 2:26:25| then they're all frustrated in the end when you reject all their proposals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=8785)|
| 2:26:29| So what I did was I gave them my entire detailed line item budget for everything we do in security,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=8789)|
| 2:26:36| and I gave it particularly to Wackenhut and said, could you do any better?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=8796)|
| 2:26:43| And they came back to me about three and a half weeks later and said, Dale, we can't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=8803)|
| 2:26:48| They were meeting with Jane Burrett and myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=8808)|
| 2:26:50| I said, there's no way we can do better than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=8810)|
| 2:26:52| We simply can't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=8812)|
| 2:26:54| And the reason is they're built to make a profit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=8814)|
| 2:26:58| So are they cost competitive with other private sector companies?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=8818)|
| 2:27:01| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=8821)|
| 2:27:02| But there are places where the public sector can do stuff more cost effectively than the private sector can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=8822)|
| 2:27:11| It's not every case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=8831)|
| 2:27:14| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=8834)|
| 2:27:17| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=8837)|
| 2:27:18| I appreciate comments from Mackenzie and from Olney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=8838)|
| 2:27:21| Those are great comments, great thoughts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=8841)|
| 2:27:23| And, Brad, what you had to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=8843)|
| 2:27:24| Dale, can you get us information on the cost per year per office that these office holders,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=8844)|
| 2:27:32| how we've got to break it down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=8852)|
| 2:27:34| Show us what you're charging these individuals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=8854)|
| 2:27:36| and how you come up with the figure that you come up for these office holders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=8856)|
| 2:27:42| And is that something you could do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=8862)|
| 2:27:44| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=8864)|
| 2:27:45| But John Troyer and I together could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=8865)|
| 2:27:50| Because, John, except for this building, the county a few years back started direct paying utilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=8870)|
| 2:27:59| This is pretty funny, actually, because there was a perception we were padding our budgets,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=8879)|
| 2:28:05| using utilities to kind of pad them a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=8885)|
| 2:28:10| When you took them back, what you really did is you took me out of the rate increase risk,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=8890)|
| 2:28:15| and it's now your risk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=8895)|
| 2:28:17| So if there's a KUB rate increase, I used to have to adjust my other parts of my budget to eat that rate increase,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=8897)|
| 2:28:26| and now you eat it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=8906)|
| 2:28:28| But that's probably just an example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=8908)|
| 2:28:32| Be careful of perception, because it isn't always reality.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=8912)|
| 2:28:35| But John has the utility costs for satellite fee offices and that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=8915)|
| 2:28:41| So I can work with him to try to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=8921)|
| 2:28:44| In fact, he may already have those numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=8924)|
| 2:28:47| If you can get that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=8927)|
| 2:28:48| And, John, one last thing for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=8928)|
| 2:28:50| Can we change this in the budget and change it over to maintenance rather than calling it rent?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=8930)|
| 2:28:59| That we get hit up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=8939)|
| 2:29:00| I'm hit up every week, every other week, about PBA and just like Olmby was saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=8940)|
| 2:29:06| Jeff was saying that, you know, the building is paid for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=8946)|
| 2:29:08| You know, we need to change the terminology.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=8948)|
| 2:29:11| Commissioner, I really wish you would or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=8951)|
| 2:29:14| In fact, I never heard that as much as I'm around this building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=8954)|
| 2:29:19| I never heard that until Dean Rice told me that the fee offices just hated PBA| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=8959)|
| 2:29:25| because they have to pay you rent and it's too much, et cetera, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=8965)|
| 2:29:30| And I'm like, what are you talking about?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=8970)|
| 2:29:32| You know what I mean?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=8972)|
| 2:29:33| We need to change that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=8973)|
| 2:29:34| And so I would welcome a new nomenclature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=8974)|
| 2:29:37| The other comment I wanted to make was kind of something Commissioner McKenzie was saying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=8977)|
| 2:29:43| and to relevance to what you're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=8983)|
| 2:29:46| That is, when I brought the consultants in, and this data is stale now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=8986)|
| 2:29:53| so I would recommend if you do it, you might work through Richard Wall's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=8993)|
| 2:29:58| But you can get data on what various local governments that are comparable in size| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=8998)|
| 2:30:05| and type of town to Knoxville are spending on the cost of their buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=9005)|
| 2:30:12| And I had the consultant do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=9012)|
| 2:30:15| They were not looking at New York and L.A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=9015)|
| 2:30:17| They were looking at comparable size markets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=9017)|
| 2:30:19| They looked at our costs and said they're absolutely in line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=9019)|
| 2:30:23| And, in fact, they recommended adding the computer maintenance thing along with two people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=9023)|
| 2:30:28| to run it and answer the phones, which actually made a slight increase in the cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=9028)|
| 2:30:36| So that type of data is available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=9036)|
| 2:30:39| But the city-county building, you would have to add the utilities costs that I just mentioned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=9039)|
| 2:30:45| to our other property management budgets to give you the total per square foot cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=9045)|
| 2:30:52| But it's $7 and something a square foot for this building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=9052)|
| 2:30:58| considering it's got a 200-bed jail going 24-7, as well as a few other things that go around the clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=9058)|
| 2:31:09| Talk to the people like Lawler Wood that run First Tennessee and Riverview Plaza| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=9069)|
| 2:31:14| and ask them what's their common area and or building operating costs per square foot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=9074)|
| 2:31:21| And I'll guarantee you what we're doing is very, very competitive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=9081)|
| 2:31:24| And you're welcome to check me on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=9084)|
| 2:31:27| And I've got commercial buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=9087)|
| 2:31:29| I know what you're talking about, so I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=9089)|
| 2:31:31| Yeah, John, if you could get that to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=9091)|
| 2:31:33| Dale, is there anything that you feel that you could outsource?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=9093)|
| 2:31:39| If I did, I'd be doing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=9099)|
| 2:31:42| Although I did, as I mentioned, in security, check it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=9102)|
| 2:31:45| I guarantee you I cannot outsource maintenance cheaper than my employees are doing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=9105)|
| 2:31:51| I was very involved in my former life in school district advisory boards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=9111)|
| 2:31:59| And I saw school districts throughout the state of Florida all, in a period of time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=9119)|
| 2:32:04| jump on contracts with ServiceMaster and companies like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=9124)|
| 2:32:09| Within a few years, they were just getting killed because their contracts are very specific.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=9129)|
| 2:32:17| And if it isn't in their contract, they don't do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=9137)|
| 2:32:20| And their profit, their need to make a profit and to pay corporate income taxes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=9140)|
| 2:32:27| they were costing the school districts more in the long run, and they were getting less service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=9147)|
| 2:32:32| Well, I'm like Sam.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=9152)|
| 2:32:33| I mean, everything I've seen, it's top-notch what you're all doing from what I see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=9153)|
| 2:32:38| But I do outsource, like I said, custodial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=9158)|
| 2:32:40| I can't be competitive there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=9160)|
| 2:32:41| I can't be competitive on parking attendance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=9161)|
| 2:32:44| But we've looked and continue to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=9164)|
| 2:32:49| I mean, I've even looked at, you know, can I cheaper outsource project management?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=9169)|
| 2:32:54| And the answer is no, because the numbers I said to Commissioner McKenzie,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=9174)|
| 2:32:58| I can't go find a for-profit company that will do a project for two or two and a half percent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=9178)|
| 2:33:04| and handle every financial receivable, payable, and all of those details for that kind of money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=9184)|
| 2:33:11| It's just not there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=9191)|
| 2:33:13| Commissioner Shouse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=9193)|
| 2:33:15| Thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=9195)|
| 2:33:17| Briefly, I do hear going to various political clubs, I hear the same thing, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=9197)|
| 2:33:23| Oh, I believe it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=9203)|
| 2:33:24| I did eventually go talk to Joy and others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=9204)|
| 2:33:27| You're a whipping boy, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=9207)|
| 2:33:30| You take a lot of bashing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=9210)|
| 2:33:32| I should say you PBA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=9212)|
| 2:33:33| And I explain as best I can that the debt service is gone, isn't it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=9213)|
| 2:33:36| There's no more debt service in that rent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=9216)|
| 2:33:38| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=9218)|
| 2:33:39| The bonds are retired.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=9219)|
| 2:33:40| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=9220)|
| 2:33:41| As we hear, well, we still are paying rent to PBA, and they're overpaid, and this and that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=9221)|
| 2:33:46| But I didn't want to dwell on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=9226)|
| 2:33:49| A couple of questions were prompted by,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=9229)|
| 2:33:51| is it roughly a two-to-one county versus city in the building?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=9231)|
| 2:33:55| In the square footage occupancy, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=9235)|
| 2:33:58| In fact, we're in the process of updating that for this year's budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=9238)|
| 2:34:04| As we speak, probably we'll have those numbers in a couple of weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=9244)|
| 2:34:07| But it's almost always right at two-thirds, one-third.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=9247)|
| 2:34:10| Two-to-one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=9250)|
| 2:34:11| And what was the square footage of the building?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=9251)|
| 2:34:12| I didn't write that down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=9252)|
| 2:34:13| It's a half a million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=9253)|
| 2:34:15| That's not exact, but I can shoot you the exact number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=9255)|
| 2:34:20| Another small sub-debate we had briefly at the pension meeting this morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=9260)|
| 2:34:27| The square footage of the building, you just put out $7 a square foot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=9267)|
| 2:34:31| Is that roughly, would that be what, if someone has 7,000 square feet, is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=9271)|
| 2:34:37| In the budget I sent you three months ago, when I first sent you all that stuff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=9277)|
| 2:34:44| that number is on the bottom of the CCB budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=9284)|
| 2:34:47| but it's not on the other buildings because we don't pay the utilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=9287)|
| 2:34:51| But it's 720 a square foot or something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=9291)|
| 2:34:55| Like the pension board, the Knox County Pension Board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=9295)|
| 2:35:00| is being charged as a subdivision of government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=9300)|
| 2:35:03| It's an accounting function that John Troyer is going through to more, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=9303)|
| 2:35:08| properly allocate financial responsibility for all the different factions of county government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=9308)|
| 2:35:14| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=9314)|
| 2:35:15| So we were trying to determine what the square footage is the pension board would pay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=9315)|
| 2:35:20| versus is it cheaper to move to the A.J. or out here to North Central somewhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=9320)|
| 2:35:25| It would be a lot easier for people to get to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=9325)|
| 2:35:27| And would this be, you mentioned the Lawlor Wood, would this be Class B office space?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=9327)|
| 2:35:34| Riverview would be A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=9334)|
| 2:35:37| Riverview, First Tennessee would be, they're right at A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=9337)|
| 2:35:41| A or B minus, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=9341)|
| 2:35:43| And this would be B or B minus?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=9343)|
| 2:35:45| I'd say B to B minus, to be honest, Ed, because when you get into the guts of this building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=9345)|
| 2:35:51| not the common areas, there's some pretty tired ceiling tiles and carpet around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=9351)|
| 2:35:57| Do you just divide up the square footage?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=9357)|
| 2:35:59| Are the corner offices that the mayors have on the sixth floor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=9359)|
| 2:36:02| the Riverviews, charge the same thing as, say, John Gustin down in the dungeon?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=9362)|
| 2:36:06| I mean, it's square footage?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=9366)|
| 2:36:08| Yes, the square footage is treated equally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=9368)|
| 2:36:10| In the private world, it would be different, wouldn't it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=9370)|
| 2:36:12| Yes, it would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=9372)|
| 2:36:13| It would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=9373)|
| 2:36:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=9374)|
| 2:36:15| And you think that's?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=9375)|
| 2:36:16| And in the private, I mean, I would say one area that the county actually gets a little bit of a break,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=9376)|
| 2:36:22| and the city's aware of it, and they have been, at least the city administrations have been, is the jail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=9382)|
| 2:36:30| You guys aren't paying any extra because that jail certainly isn't even with the nicest office on the sixth floor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=9390)|
| 2:36:37| in terms of cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=9397)|
| 2:36:39| The jail is extremely maintenance intensive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=9399)|
| 2:36:43| It's better with the women in it, that JJ did,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=9403)|
| 2:36:47| because they don't flush their uniforms down the toilet every day like some of the guys did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=9407)|
| 2:36:53| The jail is, if I went and as precisely as I could identified the higher cost versus lower cost areas of the building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=9413)|
| 2:37:05| the jail would most certainly be the top of that chart in terms of cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=9425)|
| 2:37:11| And that's evenly divided with every other square foot in the building?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=9431)|
| 2:37:16| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=9436)|
| 2:37:17| And not truly accounted for its cost?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=9437)|
| 2:37:20| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=9440)|
| 2:37:21| It would actually be not an easy task, Ed, to start, you know, does the office have windows?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=9441)|
| 2:37:30| Oh, sure, sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=9450)|
| 2:37:31| I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=9451)|
| 2:37:32| But in the private sector, it would be that way because, frankly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=9452)|
| 2:37:35| there would probably be a hundred tenants in this building, not two, if you were privately renting it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=9455)|
| 2:37:40| Well, we were trying to determine, and will in the next month, with the pension board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=9460)|
| 2:37:44| those of us who sit on it, if it can save some money by being elsewhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=9464)|
| 2:37:49| You know, that's just a function we're going through to see if the pension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=9469)|
| 2:37:55| It's probably a good exercise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=9475)|
| 2:37:58| I'll be really surprised if you find another building cheaper| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=9478)|
| 2:38:02| because except for the security differences that exist in this building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=9482)|
| 2:38:07| because most buildings you don't have any security other than a key on the door,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=9487)|
| 2:38:13| but here you're paying your hard cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=9493)|
| 2:38:17| In a private lease, you're going to pay rent plus some of those hard costs like the utilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=9497)|
| 2:38:23| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=9503)|
| 2:38:24| Most of them, so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=9504)|
| 2:38:25| We have another consideration, pensioners in wheelchairs coming,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=9505)|
| 2:38:28| parking eight blocks away and coming up and going through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=9508)|
| 2:38:31| I mean, we have some other considerations, which.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=9511)|
| 2:38:34| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=9514)|
| 2:38:35| The access issues might.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=9515)|
| 2:38:36| Yeah, the access issues, exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=9516)|
| 2:38:38| The East Tennessee Historical, if we can blame that on a commission 10 years ago, I guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=9518)|
| 2:38:44| spending that extra million dollars, but there was a lot of private money in there, too, wasn't there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=9524)|
| 2:38:48| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=9528)|
| 2:38:49| There was none?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=9529)|
| 2:38:50| None.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=9530)|
| 2:38:51| So that was taxable?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=9531)|
| 2:38:52| There was a verbal promise to try to raise private funds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=9532)|
| 2:38:58| but it never materialized in regards to the construction costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=9538)|
| 2:39:01| Now, what they have in the nonprofit corporation of the East Tennessee Historical Society, I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=9541)|
| 2:39:09| I'm sure that's totally privately funded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=9549)|
| 2:39:12| So it cost a million to make it more like the old customs house versus the bank building to the south.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=9552)|
| 2:39:20| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=9560)|
| 2:39:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=9561)|
| 2:39:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=9562)|
| 2:39:23| Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=9563)|
| 2:39:24| One question, Mr. Smith, and just clarify for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=9564)|
| 2:39:27| I went and spoke to somebody other than the other person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=9567)|
| 2:39:32| What brought the PBA in six months later on this project, on the Hardin Valley project?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=9572)|
| 2:39:37| Why weren't you a part of it before and then became a part of it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=9577)|
| 2:39:41| Because on the front end, to me, the problem may not have been the PBA setting the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=9581)|
| 2:39:47| It may have been the budget already being set.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=9587)|
| 2:39:49| And what brought you all into the process?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=9589)|
| 2:39:52| To be honest, I don't know where that six months came from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=9592)|
| 2:39:56| February of 2005, the school board selects Merritt and Lewis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=9596)|
| 2:40:00| Oh, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=9600)|
| 2:40:01| And in June of 2005, the school board asked the PBA to manage the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=9601)|
| 2:40:05| What changed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=9605)|
| 2:40:06| To be honest, what changed, I do know that, is Mayor Ragsdale simply said he would not fund the project if we weren't managing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=9606)|
| 2:40:17| He had, for whatever reasons you'd have to get from him,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=9617)|
| 2:40:21| but he had a greater confidence in us managing it than the school district managing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=9621)|
| 2:40:25| Because we bonded it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=9625)|
| 2:40:26| They didn't bond it out of their interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=9626)|
| 2:40:27| It's not in their debt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=9627)|
| 2:40:28| It's in our debt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=9628)|
| 2:40:29| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=9629)|
| 2:40:30| You were carrying that cost on your debt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=9630)|
| 2:40:32| And he simply, I mean, and Mike being, having been in an architectural firm before he was the mayor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=9632)|
| 2:40:41| Mike knew a fair amount about construction and construction delivery stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=9641)|
| 2:40:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=9646)|
| 2:40:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=9647)|
| 2:40:48| Mr. Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=9648)|
| 2:40:49| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=9649)|
| 2:40:50| Just one quick one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=9650)|
| 2:40:52| Dale, you mentioned briefly in passing there the fact that the stuff that you outsource, one of them was the custodial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=9652)|
| 2:41:01| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=9661)|
| 2:41:03| And I commend you or whoever does this for using the folks from Sertoma.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=9663)|
| 2:41:10| They have several of those out there who need to get out and do things in the community and whoever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=9670)|
| 2:41:18| I'm assuming that's the company that you hire to do this, hires the.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=9678)|
| 2:41:22| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=9682)|
| 2:41:23| Yeah, I can't take credit for that, to be honest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=9683)|
| 2:41:27| Mike Edwards, my predecessor, had them on board when I got here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=9687)|
| 2:41:33| It's funny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=9693)|
| 2:41:34| The state has a law that specifically allows cities and counties to use Sertoma for services,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=9694)|
| 2:41:40| such as they do the recycle paper piece here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=9700)|
| 2:41:45| But it didn't say PBA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=9705)|
| 2:41:47| There was a point where I was going to have to terminate it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=9707)|
| 2:41:50| but Mayor Ragsdale agreed to pick up that contract directly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=9710)|
| 2:41:54| and then we got one of the legislative delegation to amend it so we could do it ourselves,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=9714)|
| 2:42:00| and then we went back into the contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=9720)|
| 2:42:02| But those folks are good people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=9722)|
| 2:42:06| I think it's really important to try to have people like that able to have a job and to earn a living,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=9726)|
| 2:42:15| and they, frankly, do a good job for us, and their supervisors do a great job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=9735)|
| 2:42:21| They're proud of what they do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=9741)|
| 2:42:22| and I would encourage any of you that meet them out here doing their job that you, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=9742)|
| 2:42:29| give them a little attaboy, attagirl pat on the back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=9749)|
| 2:42:33| Is this the only group that what other service would you outsource?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=9753)|
| 2:42:40| You mentioned earlier that anybody who you don't outsource has the same benefits as county employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=9760)|
| 2:42:48| What other services do you outsource?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=9768)|
| 2:42:52| I'm not sure I understood that last thing you just said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=9772)|
| 2:42:56| Early on in your discussion here, you said that your employees have the same county benefits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=9776)|
| 2:43:04| Are you using the same county payroll, but they don't have the same county benefits?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=9784)|
| 2:43:08| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=9788)|
| 2:43:09| My employees have exactly the same benefits package that your employees do, but they're legally PBA employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=9789)|
| 2:43:17| And that was done, again, before I got here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=9797)|
| 2:43:21| And for some, we looked into that, to be honest, to see could we,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=9801)|
| 2:43:27| did we have the option of becoming part of the city's benefits package, and would that be more or less expensive?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=9807)|
| 2:43:34| And there was a legal reason we couldn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=9814)|
| 2:43:37| I don't remember what it was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=9817)|
| 2:43:40| So, we've stayed on yours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=9820)|
| 2:43:44| But when we outsource, the areas we outsource in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=9824)|
| 2:43:48| those employees are certainly not getting the same level of benefits that my employees and your employees have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=9828)|
| 2:43:55| So, their benefits are from whoever they work for?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=9835)|
| 2:43:58| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=9838)|
| 2:43:59| For example, Premier, which is a minority-owned firm that does the custodial in this building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=9839)|
| 2:44:07| and in some of our other buildings, their employees do not have anywhere near the same benefits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=9847)|
| 2:44:15| although their owner, Mark Isom, I think does provide them some level of benefits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=9855)|
| 2:44:22| and that's very uncommon in the custodial field.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=9862)|
| 2:44:26| For the most part in the custodial area, areas like parking attendance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=9866)|
| 2:44:31| they're making minimum wage or barely over minimum wage with no benefits at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=9871)|
| 2:44:37| So, the ones that would be included under county benefits would be basically the 81 in property management,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=9877)|
| 2:44:46| and all that does include custodial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=9886)|
| 2:44:49| So, if the roughly 100 employees that you mentioned earlier, what percentage of those are getting county benefits?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=9889)|
| 2:44:58| What percentage of my employees?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=9898)|
| 2:45:00| Well, you said you had roughly 100 employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=9900)|
| 2:45:03| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=9903)|
| 2:45:04| PBA operations, you had 81, but that also includes custodial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=9904)|
| 2:45:08| No, that's a mistake on that slide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=9908)|
| 2:45:11| Custodial should not be listed under the property management employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=9911)|
| 2:45:16| Those employees are the maintenance and security and the ground.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=9916)|
| 2:45:19| The custodial, the reason it came off of an old slide when we did have two custodial employees at the health department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=9919)|
| 2:45:27| but we no longer do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=9927)|
| 2:45:29| So, basically we could say that you have 95, give or take one or two employees who are under county benefits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=9929)|
| 2:45:38| All of our employees, of which there are just right at 100, all have the same benefits that the county employees do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=9938)|
| 2:45:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=9946)|
| 2:45:47| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=9947)|
| 2:45:48| Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=9948)|
| 2:45:49| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=9949)|
| 2:45:52| I think that I guess the thought came to me to say something really comes after Commissioner Shoust said something about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=9952)|
| 2:46:02| all of this is before our time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=9962)|
| 2:46:04| And I guess that's what we hear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=9964)|
| 2:46:07| What we hear now are complaints about things that occurred in times gone by.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=9967)|
| 2:46:12| And I need to set it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=9972)|
| 2:46:14| Let me say, let me change the subject for just a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=9974)|
| 2:46:18| The most difficult thing I had understanding in college, not that many years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=9978)|
| 2:46:25| had something to do with discrimination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=9985)|
| 2:46:29| There's overt and there's systemic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=9989)|
| 2:46:32| And it took me about three months to finally grasp that they're both discrimination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=9992)|
| 2:46:41| It's one built into the system and the other one is the thought of the person that's running the program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=10001)|
| 2:46:46| I only say that because I want to introduce that as a confusion factor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=10006)|
| 2:46:52| And whenever I hear the word PBA, public building authority,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=10012)|
| 2:46:57| is it public building as in erecting a building authority?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=10017)|
| 2:47:02| In other words, public building authority building something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=10022)|
| 2:47:06| Or is it discussed in the context of public building authority as in I'm going to take care of this building authority?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=10026)|
| 2:47:14| Sometimes we, as we've discussed it here today, we've talked about building things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=10034)|
| 2:47:19| and then we've talked about maintaining things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=10039)|
| 2:47:23| I believe that's what sometimes confuses me the most about what might be taking place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=10043)|
| 2:47:29| in someone's conversation about the PBA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=10049)|
| 2:47:32| Are they talking about building a building?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=10052)|
| 2:47:35| Or are we just talking about the building and its maintenance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=10055)|
| 2:47:38| Which, that's all an aside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=10058)|
| 2:47:40| I want to look at the last slide in the presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=10060)|
| 2:47:46| Is Hardin Valley 275,000 square feet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=10066)|
| 2:47:53| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=10073)|
| 2:47:54| Okay, thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=10074)|
| 2:48:00| I didn't measure it myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=10080)|
| 2:48:03| Oh, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=10083)|
| 2:48:06| Jerry Lewis measured it pretty well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=10086)|
| 2:48:18| Are you done?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=10098)|
| 2:48:19| I'm sorry, I was asking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=10099)|
| 2:48:21| Just a couple of quick things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=10101)|
| 2:48:22| Anybody else have anything?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=10102)|
| 2:48:25| I may be the only one left that was here during the Hardin Valley school discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=10105)|
| 2:48:31| I just wanted everyone to realize that we've just gone through a lot of hearings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=10111)|
| 2:48:35| on hillside slope and protection and there's probably more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=10115)|
| 2:48:39| At that time, there were even more hearings and more public meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=10119)|
| 2:48:43| on this Hardin Valley school than there was hillside slope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=10123)|
| 2:48:47| There were weekly meetings, like you say, for updates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=10127)|
| 2:48:49| I know I personally attended a number of meetings out in the community at the various schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=10129)|
| 2:48:54| This issue was very hotly debated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=10134)|
| 2:48:56| It was contentious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=10136)|
| 2:48:58| The notion of going and building it out for 1,400 versus 2,100 was an issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=10138)|
| 2:49:03| There was also an issue of going from 40 to 50 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=10143)|
| 2:49:06| Should we go ahead and build out the athletic facility?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=10146)|
| 2:49:08| Should we go ahead with all the parking lots?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=10148)|
| 2:49:10| All of these things were debated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=10150)|
| 2:49:12| All of these things were very much in the media, and we had many public hearings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=10152)|
| 2:49:17| many meetings about these things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=10157)|
| 2:49:19| So as far as the public vetting of this process, it was publicly vetted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=10159)|
| 2:49:22| and it was publicly vetted a lot, probably more so than it should have been,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=10162)|
| 2:49:27| but we wanted to make sure that the public knew it because it was their money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=10167)|
| 2:49:30| This was the first high school we'd built in 40 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=10170)|
| 2:49:33| And so there was a lot involved here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=10173)|
| 2:49:35| I mean, even when you got into the construction, we had to have discussions about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=10175)|
| 2:49:39| you got into rock, you had to move beavers, quite frankly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=10179)|
| 2:49:43| I mean, you know, all of that costs money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=10183)|
| 2:49:45| And so when you look at everything that was involved in that, it was a process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=10185)|
| 2:49:49| but now we have the completed school, and yes, I think it's helpful to look back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=10189)|
| 2:49:53| and say maybe we should have done this differently, maybe we could have done it better,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=10193)|
| 2:49:56| but at the time it was totally vetted in the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=10196)|
| 2:50:00| I would say this to you, Dale, there is a perception issue with PBA in the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=10200)|
| 2:50:06| I think that the perception can be looked at very quickly in terms of what is your electric bill,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=10206)|
| 2:50:14| what is your water bill, what do you do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=10214)|
| 2:50:17| Like you've told me things that you do for this facility I knew nothing about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=10217)|
| 2:50:21| like people flushing their uniforms down toilets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=10221)|
| 2:50:24| Somebody's got to take care of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=10224)|
| 2:50:26| I don't think people realize what you do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=10226)|
| 2:50:29| And I think that part of that is that you just do your job and you just do it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=10229)|
| 2:50:33| and when something happens, but yet the public and we do not know what you do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=10233)|
| 2:50:38| So I would suggest that you do maybe step up a notch letting us know what you do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=10238)|
| 2:50:44| Even if it seems mundane to you, let us know what the public building authority does| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=10244)|
| 2:50:48| and what your employees do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=10248)|
| 2:50:50| Having said that, and I've mentioned this to you before, I believe that it's time to review PBA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=10250)|
| 2:50:54| It's been 40 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=10254)|
| 2:50:56| I think perhaps it's time for us to sit down and let's look at the function, the scope,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=10256)|
| 2:50:59| and the authority of PBA, which is what we're talking about today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=10259)|
| 2:51:02| and let's bring in the experts and let's look at it and say, can we do it better?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=10262)|
| 2:51:06| Is it time to relook at the way this PBA is structured?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=10266)|
| 2:51:10| And I think you've said you wouldn't have a problem with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=10270)|
| 2:51:12| I would welcome it, Commissioner. I really would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=10272)|
| 2:51:14| So I will be bringing forward next month perhaps a framework,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=10274)|
| 2:51:17| and I'd like to meet with you on that, and let's have a discussion about the framework of how we can,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=10277)|
| 2:51:22| 40 years later, let's look at PBA, but let's do it in such a way that, again, it's,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=10282)|
| 2:51:28| I hate using the word transparent, but I want to bring in the experts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=10288)|
| 2:51:31| so that experts can come in and look at it and tell us, you guys are doing a great job| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=10291)|
| 2:51:36| or we think that you could improve in this area or improve in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=10296)|
| 2:51:40| So if you have no issue with that, I'd like to move forward with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=10300)|
| 2:51:44| Commissioner, I would welcome it because, one, if I can do it better, I'll be more than glad to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=10304)|
| 2:51:50| Two, to get to your broader communication thing, it's, we're really not built to be totally,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=10310)|
| 2:52:03| easily understood by the public in general.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=10323)|
| 2:52:06| I mean, in some respects, the way our board is structured,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=10326)|
| 2:52:10| the way we're built is to be apolitical, and if the two administrations, both city and county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=10330)|
| 2:52:20| are comfortable, pleased with what we do, that's sort of traditionally been the end of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=10340)|
| 2:52:28| And most people don't understand this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=10348)|
| 2:52:32| We're sort of the proverbial elephant, or like Commissioner Brown said, we're sort of a ghost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=10352)|
| 2:52:39| And part of that is there are roles where we are supposed to be the spear catcher,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=10359)|
| 2:52:48| that we're supposed to get the grief so you don't or so one of the mayors doesn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=10368)|
| 2:52:56| You know, there are times where, and Mayor, well, now Governor Haslam would vouch for me on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=10376)|
| 2:53:03| You know, the local tea party tortured Bill Haslam and me because we said they couldn't use this room to hold a big meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=10383)|
| 2:53:12| they wanted to hold because we don't allow political activity in this room for reasons I think most of you understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=10392)|
| 2:53:20| It would be campaign headquarters half the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=10400)|
| 2:53:23| But there are roles like that where, you know, we sort of just are meant to be the ones to take the hit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=10403)|
| 2:53:30| And, frankly, it wasn't until Mr. Loy took off on PBA that I started realizing that people don't know who we are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=10410)|
| 2:53:42| so anything somebody says about us is deemed valid because they don't know anything to the contrary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=10422)|
| 2:53:48| And that I need to figure out a way to fix.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=10428)|
| 2:53:52| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=10432)|
| 2:53:53| Thank you so much to you and your staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=10433)|
| 2:53:56| And we'll be in touch as far as forming this committee to take a look at PBA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=10436)|
| 2:54:02| Any other business to come?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=10442)|
| 2:54:03| Pardon?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=10443)|
| 2:54:04| In general, it may be your intent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=10444)|
| 2:54:08| It would probably be best if you're willing to have that be a joint city and county effort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=10448)|
| 2:54:15| That way you both would hear or see the same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=10455)|
| 2:54:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=10458)|
| 2:54:19| I will get in contact with Mayor Brown and ask him about that or Vice Mayor Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=10459)|
| 2:54:24| Great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=10464)|
| 2:54:25| Thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=10465)|
| 2:54:26| Any other business to come before us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=10466)|
| 2:54:27| If not, we are adjourned until 6 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=10467)|
| 2:54:29| And you might want to have some coffee before you get here at 6 or something to kind of jolt your senses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=10469)|
| 2:54:35| because I have a feeling it's going to be a while.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=10475)|
| 2:54:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110425businesspart2?start=10494)|
