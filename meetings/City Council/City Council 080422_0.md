| 0:07:37| some city people, and a lot of folks from the hospital about talking about reuse of the facility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=457)|
| 0:07:43| what we can keep there, what it's going to look like in four or five years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=463)|
| 0:07:46| just to give an update on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=466)|
| 0:07:48| And then hopefully there will be a public meeting in North Knoxville about that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=468)|
| 0:07:52| like there was yesterday in South Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=472)|
| 0:07:56| Other reports from members of council?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=476)|
| 0:07:58| Mr. Holquist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=478)|
| 0:07:59| It's almost real time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=479)|
| 0:08:01| There's a slight delay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=481)|
| 0:08:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=482)|
| 0:08:05| I don't want to bleep any.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=485)|
| 0:08:06| That way they can bleep any inappropriate comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=486)|
| 0:08:07| There you go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=487)|
| 0:08:08| Just in case the mayor kind of sticks his foot in his mouth, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=488)|
| 0:08:11| Yeah, it won't take long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=491)|
| 0:08:12| Or any of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=492)|
| 0:08:15| On Monday and Tuesday of next week, there's a sustainable tourism summit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=495)|
| 0:08:20| It was mentioned earlier during the beer board meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=500)|
| 0:08:23| but there may have been many people who weren't here then or weren't tuned in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=503)|
| 0:08:26| It's being put on by the State of Tennessee Department of Tourism.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=506)|
| 0:08:30| It will be at the convention center here in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=510)|
| 0:08:33| And it's really talking about how to have a sustainable tourism industry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=513)|
| 0:08:38| I think it's a great thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=518)|
| 0:08:40| So I just wanted to announce that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=520)|
| 0:08:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=524)|
| 0:08:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=525)|
| 0:08:46| Vice Mayor Brown, finally in his own seat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=526)|
| 0:08:48| Thank you, Mr. Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=528)|
| 0:08:51| What I wanted to just say is I had the distinct pleasure here recently to go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=531)|
| 0:08:55| and help US Cellular present a check to Child Help Incorporated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=535)|
| 0:09:01| which does a really great job helping children in need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=541)|
| 0:09:04| I got a chance to see their facility, and a great facility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=544)|
| 0:09:08| and what they're doing down there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=548)|
| 0:09:09| They're always in need of any assistance they can get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=549)|
| 0:09:11| or donations for the young kids that they provide services to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=551)|
| 0:09:14| But I wanted to give them their kudos today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=554)|
| 0:09:18| and tell them I was really impressed with the operation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=558)|
| 0:09:21| I was really impressed with what US Cellular did with regards to donating money to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=561)|
| 0:09:26| And that organization is really providing a great service in this community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=566)|
| 0:09:30| and I wanted to thank them for allowing me to be an opportunity of their celebration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=570)|
| 0:09:34| and tell everyone in Knoxville that that's a great resource| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=574)|
| 0:09:37| that is providing great benefits for our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=577)|
| 0:09:39| Good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=579)|
| 0:09:40| Thank you, and thanks for representing us there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=580)|
| 0:09:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=582)|
| 0:09:43| I have one last item for Mayor's Report before we go into the agendas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=583)|
| 0:09:45| I would love to ask Mike Murray,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=585)|
| 0:09:47| who's the President and General Manager of the Knoxville Ice Bears,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=587)|
| 0:09:50| who I know I saw him here just a second ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=590)|
| 0:09:52| and Scott Hillman, who's their coach, if you guys would come down to the podium, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=592)|
| 0:09:57| And I think they have Kim Bittinger, who works with them in marketing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=597)|
| 0:10:01| and Scott was great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=601)|
| 0:10:02| He brought his family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=602)|
| 0:10:04| Daylon, his wife, is here, and I think his kids, Corbin and Gunner, are here as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=604)|
| 0:10:08| As you all remember, when they were here last time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=608)|
| 0:10:11| just two weeks ago or four weeks ago, I can't remember,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=611)|
| 0:10:14| it was to celebrate that they had won the regular season champion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=614)|
| 0:10:16| Since that time, they've won the division playoffs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=616)|
| 0:10:19| and finally the league playoffs to be the regular season champs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=619)|
| 0:10:23| and the league champs for the Ice Bears.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=623)|
| 0:10:25| And Coach and Mike, congratulations, and we'd love to hear just a few words from you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=625)|
| 0:10:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=630)|
| 0:10:41| Dang, now that's impressive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=641)|
| 0:10:44| Thank you, Mr. Mayor, and thanks again for having us in this forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=644)|
| 0:10:47| Obviously, when we were last here, we had accomplished one thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=647)|
| 0:10:52| but we said at that time that our work was not finished.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=652)|
| 0:10:55| We have a great group of guys that came here from all parts of this country| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=655)|
| 0:11:00| and Canada to represent Knoxville, and we held true to what we wanted to accomplish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=660)|
| 0:11:06| We brought Knoxville not one but two championships,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=666)|
| 0:11:09| and we couldn't have done it without the support of the Knoxville fans,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=669)|
| 0:11:12| our booster club, our season ticket holders, and all of our corporate sponsors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=672)|
| 0:11:16| We really appreciate them that came along to ride with us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=676)|
| 0:11:20| but we've got to give a lot of credit to our new head coach| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=680)|
| 0:11:23| that I was able to find six weeks, only six weeks before training camp started,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=683)|
| 0:11:27| so we're very happy to have him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=687)|
| 0:11:29| Thanks, Coach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=689)|
| 0:11:30| We'd love to have a few words, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=690)|
| 0:11:32| Well, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=692)|
| 0:11:33| Thank you to everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=693)|
| 0:11:35| In fact, this last week or so, my family and I have seen more of this great city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=695)|
| 0:11:39| than we had all year because we finally had a chance to relax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=699)|
| 0:11:42| But we've had some great celebration with the people of Knoxville on Wednesday night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=702)|
| 0:11:46| We had about 500 fans join us outside the Coliseum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=706)|
| 0:11:50| Thursday, we are down to the concert in the Square, which was great,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=710)|
| 0:11:55| first time for us to see that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=715)|
| 0:11:57| And then we're out to the Smokies ballpark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=717)|
| 0:11:59| So we're enjoying the city, and all the players love this city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=719)|
| 0:12:02| And for that reason, we're going to get many of them back next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=722)|
| 0:12:05| So thank you to all the people of Knoxville for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=725)|
| 0:12:08| Well, thank you for adding to our quality of life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=728)|
| 0:12:10| Unless I'm mis-| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=730)|
| 0:12:11| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=731)|
| 0:12:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=732)|
| 0:12:17| Am I right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=737)|
| 0:12:18| You guys won the first playoff series 3-1 and swept the second one 3-0.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=738)|
| 0:12:21| Did I have that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=741)|
| 0:12:22| 3-2 in the first round.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=742)|
| 0:12:23| It was a nail-biter and 3-0 in the second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=743)|
| 0:12:26| Sweeping the series final is pretty impressive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=746)|
| 0:12:28| So, again, on behalf of the people of Knoxville, thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=748)|
| 0:12:31| Gracious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=751)|
| 0:12:32| Have official proclamations, which I'll walk around and give you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=752)|
| 0:12:34| You don't have to walk up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=754)|
| 0:12:35| But, again, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=755)|
| 0:12:36| Thanks for taking the time to come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=756)|
| 0:12:37| And, Scott, thanks for bringing your wife and kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=757)|
| 0:12:40| And welcome to Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=760)|
| 0:12:42| You've represented us very well in this very first year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=762)|
| 0:12:44| Thanks a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=764)|
| 0:12:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=765)|
| 0:12:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=766)|
| 0:12:56| 9A is an ordinance to amend Ordinance Number 0-155-00,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=776)|
| 0:13:01| granting tonology of Knoxville Inc.,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=781)|
| 0:13:03| a franchise for the use and occupancy of public ways in the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=783)|
| 0:13:06| for the purpose of constructing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=786)|
| 0:13:07| and operating a cable television system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=787)|
| 0:13:09| and other telecommunication privileges in the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=789)|
| 0:13:12| specifically relating to liquidated damages,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=792)|
| 0:13:14| completion of the cable system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=794)|
| 0:13:16| and providing cable television service to certain facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=796)|
| 0:13:19| Move approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=799)|
| 0:13:20| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=800)|
| 0:13:21| I think, and Debbie, correct me if I'm wrong,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=801)|
| 0:13:24| our law department thinks it's best if we consider 9A and 11A together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=804)|
| 0:13:30| because of the nature of the agreement that we've made with knowledge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=810)|
| 0:13:34| due to the state franchise law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=814)|
| 0:13:36| Am I right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=816)|
| 0:13:37| Yes, and I can address the agreement that we've added to the resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=817)|
| 0:13:41| I guess we need a motion to consider them together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=821)|
| 0:13:44| Am I right on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=824)|
| 0:13:45| Motion to suspend the rules and consider them together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=825)|
| 0:13:48| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=828)|
| 0:13:49| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=829)|
| 0:13:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=830)|
| 0:13:51| Debbie, would you like to explain the amendment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=831)|
| 0:13:53| The amendment that we have on second reading,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=833)|
| 0:13:56| we had the discussion last council meeting that we requested a postponement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=836)|
| 0:14:01| to look at the pending legislation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=841)|
| 0:14:04| and it was a 68-page document we had just received that day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=844)|
| 0:14:08| We have looked at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=848)|
| 0:14:09| We are keeping in mind that this is still a draft bill,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=849)|
| 0:14:12| but there are provisions in there that caused us some concern about the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=852)|
| 0:14:18| enforcement of the liquidated damages| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=858)|
| 0:14:20| and such should they be given the opportunity to opt into a state franchise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=860)|
| 0:14:24| So given that, we developed this draft compromise and settlement agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=864)|
| 0:14:29| So in the event that the bill is passed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=869)|
| 0:14:34| and they opt into a state franchise,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=874)|
| 0:14:36| we will still be able to enforce the outstanding accrued liquidated damages| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=876)|
| 0:14:43| and the build-out, the 5% that will go to build-out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=883)|
| 0:14:48| until the natural termination, which was 2015.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=888)|
| 0:14:52| I see Vice Mayor Brown's light.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=892)|
| 0:14:55| I'm willing to call it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=895)|
| 0:14:56| If you'd like, I can explain why we are making recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=896)|
| 0:15:00| But also, if you'd like to go, you're welcome to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=900)|
| 0:15:03| I'll gladly wait after your explanation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=903)|
| 0:15:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=905)|
| 0:15:06| Let me just say this because a lot of people have said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=906)|
| 0:15:08| well, you know, Knowledgey made a deal however many years that was ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=908)|
| 0:15:12| and they haven't followed through on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=912)|
| 0:15:15| And I think that we should make them do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=915)|
| 0:15:18| And we would love to do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=918)|
| 0:15:20| but we don't think we have the right to make them do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=920)|
| 0:15:24| We don't have the legal ability to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=924)|
| 0:15:27| you guys have to extend this system throughout the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=927)|
| 0:15:32| We also don't think we have the legal right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=932)|
| 0:15:34| and we don't think it would be wise anyway, just to throw them out of business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=934)|
| 0:15:39| I think what we have are two choices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=939)|
| 0:15:42| You have a choice to say what we're recommending,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=942)|
| 0:15:45| which is take the $400,000 which you owe us in penalties for not performing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=945)|
| 0:15:50| and apply that to extend the existing coverage you have to more homes in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=950)|
| 0:15:57| And then you will continue to owe us $5,000 going forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=957)|
| 0:16:00| for not carrying forward as the agreement first stipulated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=960)|
| 0:16:05| The second is to say, no, you owe us $400,000 in fines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=965)|
| 0:16:09| We want you to pay us that, and then you'll still pay us $5,000 going forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=969)|
| 0:16:13| The reason we're recommending this way is this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=973)|
| 0:16:17| The message we've heard from counsel loud and clear is our concern here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=977)|
| 0:16:20| is that there will be more competition available to more homes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=980)|
| 0:16:24| and we think this takes that money instead of paying it to us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=984)|
| 0:16:27| and forces them to use that to expand it to other homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=987)|
| 0:16:32| As far as I understand, that's our alternatives,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=992)|
| 0:16:34| and if I've missed something, obviously I stand willing to be corrected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=994)|
| 0:16:37| But this isn't a case of us saying, do we think they should extend service to more homes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=997)|
| 0:16:42| We obviously do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=1002)|
| 0:16:44| We don't have the ability, we don't think, to force them to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=1004)|
| 0:16:47| So what we've done is make the decision to use those dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=1007)|
| 0:16:51| to expand service as much as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=1011)|
| 0:16:53| This is a unique situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=1013)|
| 0:16:55| This is a government that's telling a business how they should expand their business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=1015)|
| 0:17:01| It's not a public utility, but because we have the right to oversee them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=1021)|
| 0:17:04| because they're in our right-of-ways, it's a rather unique case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=1024)|
| 0:17:07| So if you think about it, it's all a little different case that we're arguing here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=1027)|
| 0:17:11| We've tried to take what counsel has said in that our real concern is providing competitive cable service| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=1031)|
| 0:17:16| to folks as much as possible and force that to happen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=1036)|
| 0:17:19| and that's why we're recommending what we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=1039)|
| 0:17:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=1041)|
| 0:17:22| Vice Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=1042)|
| 0:17:23| I'd like to lift on another point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=1043)|
| 0:17:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=1044)|
| 0:17:25| We have a procedural motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=1045)|
| 0:17:28| That is right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=1048)|
| 0:17:29| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=1049)|
| 0:17:30| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=1050)|
| 0:17:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=1051)|
| 0:17:32| That's a great correction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=1052)|
| 0:17:33| So I guess we need to vote on the – thank you for the correction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=1053)|
| 0:17:35| I have a comment on the procedural issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=1055)|
| 0:17:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=1056)|
| 0:17:38| Here's my – just the gist of my issue why they might need to stay separate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=1058)|
| 0:17:42| I can understand trying to – the resolution that's only going to take one reading| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=1062)|
| 0:17:47| that comes second in the agenda, that's creating a contractual right between the city and knowledge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=1067)|
| 0:17:53| However, the ordinance that's on second reading, you know, for reasons we'll get into later,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=1073)|
| 0:17:58| I think we can do better in getting that billed out going faster.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=1078)|
| 0:18:05| So for that reason, I have a little concern about putting the two together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=1085)|
| 0:18:11| because I might support one and not the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=1091)|
| 0:18:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=1094)|
| 0:18:15| One thought there is we could consider them together but vote separately,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=1095)|
| 0:18:20| if that helps the discussion purposes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=1100)|
| 0:18:23| Just rearrange the agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=1103)|
| 0:18:26| Yeah, I think that's probably what we would be doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=1106)|
| 0:18:30| So I guess that's what we're proposing then with the process to consider them together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=1110)|
| 0:18:36| but to vote separately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=1116)|
| 0:18:38| To move 11A behind 9A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=1118)|
| 0:18:41| Yes, that's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=1121)|
| 0:18:44| That'd be right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=1124)|
| 0:18:45| Does somebody want to – are the lights about the procedure?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=1125)|
| 0:18:50| Raise your hand if so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=1130)|
| 0:18:51| If not, we're going to go ahead and vote on the procedure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=1131)|
| 0:18:53| So what's on the table is understanding that we're going to discuss them together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=1133)|
| 0:18:57| and then move 11A after 9A and vote on them separately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=1137)|
| 0:19:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=1140)|
| 0:19:01| All those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=1141)|
| 0:19:02| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=1142)|
| 0:19:03| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=1143)|
| 0:19:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=1144)|
| 0:19:05| Now we will go to the discussion of – we're discussing them together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=1145)|
| 0:19:09| and we'll vote on them separately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=1149)|
| 0:19:10| I have no idea whose light was first here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=1150)|
| 0:19:14| I'll go to Ms. Roddy because I'm going to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=1154)|
| 0:19:17| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=1157)|
| 0:19:18| I know that there were a number of concerns expressed by my colleagues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=1158)|
| 0:19:23| the last time this was considered about areas of the city that haven't received service yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=1163)|
| 0:19:28| But I support this amended contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=1168)|
| 0:19:30| I think it commits Ology to a defined amount of capital investment toward build-out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=1170)|
| 0:19:36| Without this amendment, we have no guarantee of future growth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=1176)|
| 0:19:39| only a guarantee of future assessment of fines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=1179)|
| 0:19:42| I mean, they can stop the build-out if that's their choice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=1182)|
| 0:19:45| This commits them to that future build-out and that future capital investment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=1185)|
| 0:19:50| Also, without this amended contract, we have no resolution of the CTV dispute,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=1190)|
| 0:19:54| which has been ongoing since this franchise was issued.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=1194)|
| 0:19:57| This guarantees that community television will be accessible to Ology subscribers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=1197)|
| 0:20:03| We also have the benefit of provision of service to the nine defined community and recreation and senior centers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=1203)|
| 0:20:09| and we also have the benefit of a little more accountability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=1209)|
| 0:20:13| We have quarterly and annual reports guaranteed in this amended agreement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=1213)|
| 0:20:18| so we can better track their progress toward build-out and their progress toward capital investment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=1218)|
| 0:20:24| So for all of those reasons, I support this amended contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=1224)|
| 0:20:27| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=1227)|
| 0:20:28| Councilman Hulquist, then we'll come back over here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=1228)|
| 0:20:32| I, in general, support this also for the same reasons that Councilman Roddy gave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=1232)|
| 0:20:37| One concern I have, and I've mentioned this to the Ology folks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=1237)|
| 0:20:41| and they indicated a willingness to revisit it, I think, from what I heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=1241)|
| 0:20:47| Maybe I don't remember the conversation accurately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=1247)|
| 0:20:50| We have two Ology representatives here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=1250)|
| 0:20:52| Felix is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=1252)|
| 0:20:54| But that has to do with the rec center supplying Ology service to the rec centers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=1254)|
| 0:21:03| And if you look at the list, the nine rec centers that are listed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=1263)|
| 0:21:08| the implication, I think, might be made, accurately or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=1268)|
| 0:21:12| that these are the only rec centers that will be passed during the time that this agreement is enforced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=1272)|
| 0:21:24| And what I said to them was I would like to see other rec centers also included in the agreement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=1284)|
| 0:21:29| at such time as they might be passed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=1289)|
| 0:21:32| And my impression from the conversations I had with the senior executives from Ology,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=1292)|
| 0:21:40| including the CEO, and Felix can correct me if he'd like if I'm wrong,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=1300)|
| 0:21:45| but of course he would have to come to the mic to do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=1305)|
| 0:21:47| but is that they may be willing to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=1307)|
| 0:21:52| So if we're going to talk about that, I think this is the time to talk about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=1312)|
| 0:21:57| Councilman Holquist, you had mentioned that to me as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=1317)|
| 0:22:01| And Felix and I had a conversation about this earlier today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=1321)|
| 0:22:06| and Felix did confirm that as they do the build-out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=1326)|
| 0:22:10| and that build-out then incorporates another area where a community center is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=1330)|
| 0:22:14| then they would bring that community center in as they are proposing to do with the nine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=1334)|
| 0:22:20| So does that mean we should amend this document to reflect that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=1340)|
| 0:22:26| Well, that's certainly something that you could do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=1346)|
| 0:22:28| but we have a clear understanding, I think, with Ology as to their willingness to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=1348)|
| 0:22:33| I have no reason to doubt that, but that's council's choice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=1353)|
| 0:22:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=1358)|
| 0:22:39| My preference would be if we're listing some of them to incorporate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=1359)|
| 0:22:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=1363)|
| 0:22:44| So, Norton, we will come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=1364)|
| 0:22:45| I won't let the discussion go on without coming back to bringing that up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=1365)|
| 0:22:49| Ms. Pelo, and then I'll go to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=1369)|
| 0:22:51| Would you like to go to the last question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=1371)|
| 0:22:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=1372)|
| 0:22:53| Ms. Pelo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=1373)|
| 0:22:54| Well, the last time that we heard this, which was on first reading,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=1374)|
| 0:23:01| many people may realize that I took a very strong stand on my position| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=1381)|
| 0:23:06| in regard to Ology's failure to meet the terms of the contract| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=1386)|
| 0:23:11| and was very disappointed in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=1391)|
| 0:23:14| And, you know, while morally and ethically I still feel a great sense of disappointment in that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=1394)|
| 0:23:22| spent a very, at least an hour, in a very intense but very pleasant conversation with the CEO,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=1402)|
| 0:23:30| with Mr. Johnson, is that correct, and with Felix and the Knoxville district manager.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=1410)|
| 0:23:37| And we very frankly commented about the sense of failure to fulfill their contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=1417)|
| 0:23:47| And my sense of, as a council member, of how I feel about having been a party to that agreement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=1427)|
| 0:23:55| and it not being kept.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=1435)|
| 0:23:57| I still have major concerns about the build-out and the disappointment that it has,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=1437)|
| 0:24:03| I guess the term is cherry-picked the areas because that's what is in my mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=1443)|
| 0:24:08| Now, in that conversation there were a number of things that were explained to me, I guess you might say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=1448)|
| 0:24:18| that have occurred along the way in regard to Ology's position financially and economically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=1458)|
| 0:24:26| and how their original big plans did not really get fulfilled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=1466)|
| 0:24:34| And just in the way that I would do with anyone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=1474)|
| 0:24:40| I very directly indicated that I thought there was a failure there on the part of Ology that was regrettable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=1480)|
| 0:24:46| and could have been prevented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=1486)|
| 0:24:48| And perhaps had they communicated with the administration, had they communicated with this council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=1488)|
| 0:24:55| we would have understood the difficulties that they were encountering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=1495)|
| 0:24:58| and encountered during this period of time that they were not able to fulfill that contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=1498)|
| 0:25:04| So Mr. Johnson and I kind of were nose-to-nose when we talked about my sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=1504)|
| 0:25:11| It is crucial that they stay in communication.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=1511)|
| 0:25:15| If there's difficulty with a contract, which we have all agreed to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=1515)|
| 0:25:18| and one party knows it's not going to be able to be fulfilled,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=1518)|
| 0:25:24| then certainly the other party needs to be informed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=1524)|
| 0:25:29| So I'm glad to see that there is a clause here that indicates that we will receive frequent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=1529)|
| 0:25:37| and regular reports from them regarding where they are, what their plans are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=1537)|
| 0:25:45| and how they are able to execute those plans in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=1545)|
| 0:25:50| I understand the comments that the mayor made| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=1550)|
| 0:25:53| and why this is beneficial in the sense that those fines be returned to this community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=1553)|
| 0:26:01| with the indication they will be used for build-out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=1561)|
| 0:26:05| And I have almost convinced myself that I'll be at peace with myself if I approve this contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=1565)|
| 0:26:14| But, frankly, it's just simply very difficult to, when I feel so strongly convicted about this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=1574)|
| 0:26:23| and so very disappointed in the original arrangement not being met, to have to take a different look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=1583)|
| 0:26:31| But I think in being responsible as a council member, I have to be responsible to the whole community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=1591)|
| 0:26:39| And so I am going to, with the full understanding that the expectations are very high| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=1599)|
| 0:26:50| and that communication should be very frequent and very honest with both parties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=1610)|
| 0:26:59| I have come to the conclusion that I must support this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=1619)|
| 0:27:05| though I still have those very big frustrations about the disappointment that I spoke of a couple weeks ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=1625)|
| 0:27:15| Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=1635)|
| 0:27:17| Councilman Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=1637)|
| 0:27:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=1638)|
| 0:27:19| Councilman Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=1639)|
| 0:27:20| He was on first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=1640)|
| 0:27:21| Somebody is going to have to go first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=1641)|
| 0:27:24| I think people know where I am, know how I feel about this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=1644)|
| 0:27:28| and I want to give everybody a chance to say what they need to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=1648)|
| 0:27:31| As I said before, I said, quite frankly, it makes no sense to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=1651)|
| 0:27:37| And I respectfully have to disagree with the administration, with the mayor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=1657)|
| 0:27:42| with some of my fellow council members' comments about what we are doing here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=1662)|
| 0:27:46| I cannot in good conscience sanction discrimination against certain parts of this town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=1666)|
| 0:27:51| And that's what it is doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=1671)|
| 0:27:52| It is basically saying that we don't know when, if,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=1672)|
| 0:27:56| or if we will even try to come and build out in the east part of this town or the south part of this town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=1676)|
| 0:28:01| Some of these other little red herrings that are thrown into this contract, you're going to deal with CTV,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=1681)|
| 0:28:07| that was in the original contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=1687)|
| 0:28:09| Somehow in the original contract, someone looked at the language and said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=1689)|
| 0:28:13| grantees shall carry the community television channel of Knoxville as a first tier channel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=1693)|
| 0:28:18| so long as that channel properly maintains its non-profit status.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=1698)|
| 0:28:21| It said, that's not strong enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=1701)|
| 0:28:23| I don't know if we need to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=1703)|
| 0:28:24| So now they're coming back and saying, we're going to add that in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=1704)|
| 0:28:27| Adding in the rec centers, they're in places where they're already doing build out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=1707)|
| 0:28:31| You know, I have not heard anything from these individuals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=1711)|
| 0:28:34| or anything from anyone that tells me that they will ever get to east Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=1714)|
| 0:28:38| that they ever get to the east side of town or the south side of town with this build out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=1718)|
| 0:28:43| We are sanctioning and telling them, take money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=1723)|
| 0:28:45| You already owe the citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=1725)|
| 0:28:46| Take money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=1726)|
| 0:28:47| You already owe this community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=1727)|
| 0:28:48| Apply it to what you are already supposed to be doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=1728)|
| 0:28:51| And that is building out in this community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=1731)|
| 0:28:53| There is anybody here that can say today when this contract was done in the past| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=1733)|
| 0:28:57| that we did not think that they would not stick forward and go forward and build out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=1737)|
| 0:29:01| the way they said they were going to build out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=1741)|
| 0:29:03| No one would have said looking at that agreement, oops, three or four or five years down the line,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=1743)|
| 0:29:07| it's not enforceable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=1747)|
| 0:29:09| We've got a situation where we can't force them to expand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=1749)|
| 0:29:11| That was the intent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=1751)|
| 0:29:13| That was the understanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=1753)|
| 0:29:14| So now they're saying they can't be held to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=1754)|
| 0:29:16| What's to stop them in 2010 or 2011 to say, well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=1756)|
| 0:29:19| that last contract you just approved in 2008 wasn't quite strong enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=1759)|
| 0:29:23| It's got some loopholes in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=1763)|
| 0:29:25| We're still not going to build out in east Nassau.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=1765)|
| 0:29:27| We're not going to build out in Holston Hills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=1767)|
| 0:29:29| We're still not going to build out in south Nassau.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=1769)|
| 0:29:31| It is unacceptable for us to sit here and sit back with colorful language,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=1771)|
| 0:29:36| put in a new contract, and say this is okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=1776)|
| 0:29:39| Our contracts have non-discrimination clauses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=1779)|
| 0:29:42| The state contract requires non-discrimination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=1782)|
| 0:29:44| Why are we going to sit here and sanction it right now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=1784)|
| 0:29:47| Why do we not make a part of this contract a requirement that they build out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=1787)|
| 0:29:50| that you go ahead and get started immediately in south Nassau or east Nassau| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=1790)|
| 0:29:55| or Holston Hills or other parts of this community that are nowhere on this map| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=1795)|
| 0:29:59| to be built out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=1799)|
| 0:30:00| We're going to assume that they're going to step forward and do the right thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=1800)|
| 0:30:04| when they didn't do the right thing to begin with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=1804)|
| 0:30:06| That's what I've got a problem with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=1806)|
| 0:30:08| It's a credibility issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=1808)|
| 0:30:09| If you can come forward now and say, hey, you know, we can't build out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=1809)|
| 0:30:13| We just can't do it right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=1813)|
| 0:30:14| We've only got to build out where we started in west Nassau and part of north Nassau.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=1814)|
| 0:30:18| But trust us, we're going to do it in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=1818)|
| 0:30:21| You asked us to trust you when we did it the first time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=1821)|
| 0:30:24| We approved this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=1824)|
| 0:30:25| People in east Nassau and south Nassau and Holston Hills and part of this community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=1825)|
| 0:30:29| deserve competitive cable services just like everybody else does| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=1829)|
| 0:30:32| and deserve it, and those are low-income areas that deserve it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=1832)|
| 0:30:35| They have a lot of interest and a lot of cable service being bought from Comcast Cable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=1835)|
| 0:30:39| This is very frustrating to me that we're even sitting here having this type of discussion about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=1839)|
| 0:30:43| You know, it implies when we say, well, if we don't approve this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=1843)|
| 0:30:46| then knowledge is just going to pay us the fines and move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=1846)|
| 0:30:49| That implies that knowledge has no credibility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=1849)|
| 0:30:51| that they have no integrity to step forward and deal with the deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=1851)|
| 0:30:54| We're basically saying if they don't do this, they're going to look at us and go ahead and breach,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=1854)|
| 0:30:58| and I guess we've got to go ahead and meet them again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=1858)|
| 0:31:01| If they have that type of mindset that says if we don't approve this now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=1861)|
| 0:31:05| then all we're going to do is pay you your $5,000 and not build out anywhere,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=1865)|
| 0:31:08| what's to say they're not going to have a different mindset in 2009, 2010,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=1868)|
| 0:31:12| 2011, or 2012 when it comes to this contract?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=1872)|
| 0:31:17| It is unacceptable for us to sit here and even have this type of discussion without saying to them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=1877)|
| 0:31:21| guys, you have to come up with a plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=1881)|
| 0:31:23| There's not even a plan on the table that says we're going to go,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=1883)|
| 0:31:27| our plan is, our goal is to get started in South Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=1887)|
| 0:31:31| get started in East Knoxville in 2010, 2011, according to current market trends, if we get there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=1891)|
| 0:31:36| and to at least put that on the table and then say if we don't, if we can't do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=1896)|
| 0:31:40| we're going to come back to you, but this is our plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=1900)|
| 0:31:42| This is our goal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=1902)|
| 0:31:43| This is our strategic plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=1903)|
| 0:31:45| Every business does it, but they haven't been able to come forward and say that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=1905)|
| 0:31:48| You know, the mayor is right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=1908)|
| 0:31:49| It is government telling business where to expand, but I disagree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=1909)|
| 0:31:52| We're not telling business where to expand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=1912)|
| 0:31:54| We're telling business live up to the intent of the agreement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=1914)|
| 0:31:57| and build out all of East Knoxville and all of South Knoxville, all of Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=1917)|
| 0:32:01| because all the citizens of Knoxville deserve an opportunity to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=1921)|
| 0:32:04| We're not telling you where to expand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=1924)|
| 0:32:05| We're saying honor the contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=1925)|
| 0:32:07| And I think what we're putting forth here right now doesn't do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=1927)|
| 0:32:09| It doesn't honor the spirit and intent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=1929)|
| 0:32:11| It once again gives rhetoric to the fact that they say we're going to try.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=1931)|
| 0:32:16| We might get to East Knoxville or Holston Hills or South Knoxville or Park Ridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=1936)|
| 0:32:22| We might get there, but if we don't, you know, we're going to build out where we already are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=1942)|
| 0:32:27| and that's just not acceptable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=1947)|
| 0:32:29| There are good, honest, taxpaying citizens in parts of this city and parts of this town| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=1949)|
| 0:32:33| that are not even going to get a chance to even have this option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=1953)|
| 0:32:37| And I cannot vote for either one of these proposals because I want to be very,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=1957)|
| 0:32:41| very clear down the line that I cannot support this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=1961)|
| 0:32:44| And if they build it out and do what they're supposed to do well and good,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=1964)|
| 0:32:47| and I'll pat them on the back and be the first one to come there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=1967)|
| 0:32:51| and hand them out a proclamation, Mayor, I'll do it for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=1971)|
| 0:32:53| But I just cannot support what we are doing here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=1973)|
| 0:32:56| It's just not acceptable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=1976)|
| 0:32:59| Mr. Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=1979)|
| 0:33:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=1980)|
| 0:33:01| I didn't mind yielding to that at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=1981)|
| 0:33:04| Some facts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=1984)|
| 0:33:05| Eight years and four days ago, our predecessors on council approved this contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=1985)|
| 0:33:11| It was to have been done four years and four days ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=1991)|
| 0:33:15| Here we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=1995)|
| 0:33:16| In 2006, this council first brought this issue up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=1996)|
| 0:33:20| and I'm not sure that we received a response really from knowledge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=2000)|
| 0:33:25| I believe it was brought up again in 2007, and we got a little bit more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=2005)|
| 0:33:31| The most information before the current situation we're in, I received from KUB| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=2011)|
| 0:33:37| in asking them to provide me a map of the area where knowledge had built out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=2017)|
| 0:33:45| I realize hindsight is 20-20,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=2025)|
| 0:33:48| and we're getting kind of pushed in the situation of what's going on with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=2028)|
| 0:33:52| AT&T cable bill in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=2032)|
| 0:33:55| But I can confer and agree with Vice Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=2035)|
| 0:34:01| I think we can do better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=2041)|
| 0:34:05| Knowledgey, and I would greatly appreciate the meeting I had with Felix Bocucci,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=2045)|
| 0:34:10| Roger Johnson, and the others from Knowledgey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=2050)|
| 0:34:13| They said they have about a $30 million investment in Knoxville and Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=2053)|
| 0:34:19| I would respectfully submit that they're not going to abandon that investment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=2059)|
| 0:34:27| Another interesting statistic is zero.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=2067)|
| 0:34:30| Zero is the number of KCDC properties that Knowledgey serves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=2070)|
| 0:34:37| Another fact, about four weeks ago, I talked with the folks over at CTV| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=2077)|
| 0:34:44| and asked them how the negotiations were going with Knowledgey,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=2084)|
| 0:34:47| that they were talking about to hear or to provide this to their customer base.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=2087)|
| 0:34:54| The head of CTV, if I recall correctly, four weeks ago hadn't heard from them yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=2094)|
| 0:34:59| I would think the head of CTV, if I recall that conversation correctly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=2099)|
| 0:35:03| would have been one of the first to know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=2103)|
| 0:35:05| And in talking with them either yesterday or today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=2105)|
| 0:35:08| they're going to be providing the Internet feed that we now can get at our homes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=2108)|
| 0:35:14| and businesses as discussed earlier tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=2114)|
| 0:35:17| Another interesting thing that I looked at, I pulled the latest census data for Knoxville, year 2000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=2117)|
| 0:35:25| There are approximately 85,000 housing units in the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=2125)|
| 0:35:30| That's not people, that's a home, whether it's an apartment, a condo, a house, or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=2130)|
| 0:35:36| They're about 85,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=2136)|
| 0:35:38| And I'm going on the assumption that we're not including any of the new structures| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=2138)|
| 0:35:44| that are getting built in town since that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=2144)|
| 0:35:48| And we can't forget also, there's a similar situation with our friends in Knox County Government and Knowledgey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=2148)|
| 0:35:54| Going on the figures that I can best get from Knowledgey and their reinvestment every year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=2154)|
| 0:36:02| that they're talking about compounding it 10% a year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=2162)|
| 0:36:07| they will build out the city not in years but probably two decades.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=2167)|
| 0:36:12| I pressed Mr. Johnson for we need to come up with something better, something more concrete.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=2172)|
| 0:36:19| He obviously has stockholders that he needs to listen to and a board of directors that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=2179)|
| 0:36:25| stockholders can be national and international.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=2185)|
| 0:36:28| I told him in our meeting that my stockholders here are local.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=2188)|
| 0:36:32| They're inside the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=2192)|
| 0:36:34| Those are the stockholders that I represent and report to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=2194)|
| 0:36:40| I personally, my day job, I'm an attorney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=2200)|
| 0:36:43| I personally have a difference of legal opinion with Mrs. Poplin about the potential enforcement mechanisms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=2203)|
| 0:36:48| that the city of Knoxville has.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=2208)|
| 0:36:51| You know, I've got real concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=2211)|
| 0:36:54| I think we can do better, like I said twice before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=2214)|
| 0:36:58| I mean, all these folks out here tonight that are here for the Chilhowee Hills zoning situation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=2218)|
| 0:37:05| if you're in close proximity to that church, we're talking about a service that you can't receive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=2225)|
| 0:37:09| that you are supposed to get April 18th of 2004, pure and simple.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=2229)|
| 0:37:15| Now, should this have been picked up by previous people in the city?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=2235)|
| 0:37:20| Yes, but this council has tried to do something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=2240)|
| 0:37:23| I think we can do better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=2243)|
| 0:37:25| I can certainly understand the need for the contractual obligation with the city that's represented in the resolution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=2245)|
| 0:37:31| but I do have grave reservations about what's presently planned in the ordinance on the second reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=2251)|
| 0:37:37| Mr. Woodhull.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=2257)|
| 0:37:40| I agree that I think we can do better,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=2260)|
| 0:37:42| and I do want to go on record as saying that I share Vice Mayor Brown's outrage at this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=2262)|
| 0:37:50| I have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=2270)|
| 0:37:51| In the original contract, didn't we stipulate that they begin in certain parts of the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=2271)|
| 0:37:59| and why couldn't we stipulate now that they can north move into other parts of the city?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=2279)|
| 0:38:06| I can answer that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=2286)|
| 0:38:08| It seems like it's supposed to start north around the Fountain City, Raffles Range Road area and west Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=2288)|
| 0:38:13| Why was that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=2293)|
| 0:38:14| I have an ology file.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=2294)|
| 0:38:15| It was stipulated in the contract that they would start somewhere north of Black Oak Drive, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=2295)|
| 0:38:21| and west of Cedar Bluff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=2301)|
| 0:38:24| I have no knowledge as to why that was specifically stated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=2304)|
| 0:38:28| The agreement goes on to say, though, that if they do not fulfill the build-out requirements there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=2308)|
| 0:38:35| they can present another plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=2315)|
| 0:38:37| Those sort of things are addressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=2317)|
| 0:38:38| So there was some anticipation clearly in the agreement that there could be changes to that build-out process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=2318)|
| 0:38:45| and quite frankly is probably why there was the liquidated damage clause within the contract to begin with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=2325)|
| 0:38:53| as to how to remedy that situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=2333)|
| 0:38:56| But there was specific requirement as to where they were to start build-out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=2336)|
| 0:39:02| and they had built out from those two beginning points from that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=2342)|
| 0:39:09| Mr. Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=2349)|
| 0:39:11| Thank you, Mr. Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=2351)|
| 0:39:12| I guess maybe, Mr. Martin, this is a question for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=2352)|
| 0:39:16| I think the Vice Mayor raised some real good questions about, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=2356)|
| 0:39:19| when are they getting to east Knoxville, south Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=2359)|
| 0:39:21| I'd like to hear an answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=2361)|
| 0:39:23| You know, what's the plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=2363)|
| 0:39:25| If we're investing, you know, the amount of money we think we are, when do we get to south Knoxville?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=2365)|
| 0:39:31| When do we get to east Knoxville?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=2371)|
| 0:39:32| When do we get to some of those places?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=2372)|
| 0:39:35| I think there's someone from Knowledgey here, and I'd invite you to come down to the podium at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=2375)|
| 0:39:48| If you'd give us your name and address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=2388)|
| 0:39:50| Yes, my name is Felix Pocucci, and I'm from 1244 Hoogie Skinner Drive, West Point, Georgia.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=2390)|
| 0:40:02| Could you repeat the question, Councilman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=2402)|
| 0:40:04| I mean, I think the Vice Mayor asked it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=2404)|
| 0:40:07| His implication is that you're never going to get to east Knoxville or south Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=2407)|
| 0:40:11| and I'd like to hear something on when are you going to get to east Knoxville and south Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=2411)|
| 0:40:17| You know, obviously there's going to be a lot of build-out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=2417)|
| 0:40:19| How fast is it going?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=2419)|
| 0:40:20| Where are you going?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=2420)|
| 0:40:22| The economics of build-out is we're going to basically expand from where we have our existing network.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=2422)|
| 0:40:33| To go and build to south Knoxville or east Knoxville would create a lot of capital with no immediate benefit to the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=2433)|
| 0:40:42| because we have to build, make ready.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=2442)|
| 0:40:44| We have to get poles ready.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=2444)|
| 0:40:45| We'd have to build plant to get to those facilities and not bring new customers onto the network.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=2445)|
| 0:40:54| So the way we would build is we expand from our existing network, and as we add more and more customers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=2454)|
| 0:40:59| we'd have the compounding effect and continue to build out the network.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=2459)|
| 0:41:05| Knowledge is committed to build the entire Knoxville market, but there's a lot of conditions, a lot of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=2465)|
| 0:41:13| We discussed in our meetings with our CEO, Roger Johnson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=2473)|
| 0:41:18| Right now we have the dot-com bust in 2000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=2478)|
| 0:41:22| Now we have the subprime issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=2482)|
| 0:41:24| We can't go to the financial markets and raise any money because nobody is going to support a build-out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=2484)|
| 0:41:30| We're fortunate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=2490)|
| 0:41:31| Knowledge is fortunate that we're in a free cash flow position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=2491)|
| 0:41:34| So we're now in a position where we can control our own destiny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=2494)|
| 0:41:39| Knowledge is here to commit a certain amount of capital every year to the city of Knoxville to continue to grow our plant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=2499)|
| 0:41:47| So with that said, it's very difficult to say that it could be five years, ten years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=2507)|
| 0:41:52| It's hard to measure what might happen in the future, both in financial markets, subprime,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=2512)|
| 0:42:00| all kinds of things that can happen in the marketplace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=2520)|
| 0:42:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=2527)|
| 0:42:08| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=2528)|
| 0:42:09| Well, I mean, it seems like the contract says you're going to invest $2.1 million over the next however many years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=2529)|
| 0:42:19| Will $2.1 million of build-out expanding where we're at, does that get us to South Knoxville?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=2539)|
| 0:42:28| If things go well, what's the time you can guarantee we won't get to South Knoxville for?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=2548)|
| 0:42:33| What's the time you can guarantee we will?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=2553)|
| 0:42:35| I wish I could make that guarantee, but we don't want to be in the same position we were back in 2000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=2555)|
| 0:42:41| We had a $1 billion deal on the table that Morgan Stanley was underwriting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=2561)|
| 0:42:47| and our expectation was that we were going to raise the funds to build out the entire city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=2567)|
| 0:42:55| And if you look at the history,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=2575)|
| 0:42:57| knowledge is about one of the only competitive players left in the game.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=2577)|
| 0:43:01| We've hunkered down, we've had good operations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=2581)|
| 0:43:05| and we're providing competitive cable services to the citizens of Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=2585)|
| 0:43:12| which statistically, according to the GAO study of the FCC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=2592)|
| 0:43:16| only 2.5% of the population of the United States has a competitive cable system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=2596)|
| 0:43:22| And I'm coming before you because I don't want to make any commitments that we can't make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=2602)|
| 0:43:28| We did that in 2000, and the financial markets blew up on us, and we couldn't meet that commitment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=2608)|
| 0:43:33| So to ask me to commit to South Knoxville at this stage, with all degree of honesty, I can't do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=2613)|
| 0:43:40| You can't even say it is 20 years out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=2620)|
| 0:43:44| In 20 years, I would say that we most likely could get to South Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=2624)|
| 0:43:49| I don't know if we could get to there in five years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=2629)|
| 0:43:52| There's a lot of factors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=2632)|
| 0:43:54| We're committed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=2634)|
| 0:43:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=2636)|
| 0:43:57| Ms. Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=2637)|
| 0:43:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=2639)|
| 0:44:00| You know, I think the important thing in this discussion, to me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=2640)|
| 0:44:03| is that there not be any implication that any of us around this table are not outraged.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=2643)|
| 0:44:09| I think every one of us here are outraged.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=2649)|
| 0:44:13| I think all of us would prefer that everyone in this community have the advantage of competitive cable service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=2653)|
| 0:44:18| I think all of us would prefer that competitive cable service be offered to KCDC properties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=2658)|
| 0:44:23| that competitive service be offered to East Knoxville, be offered to South Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=2663)|
| 0:44:26| be offered to my neighborhood, to your neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=2666)|
| 0:44:29| It's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=2669)|
| 0:44:30| And I think where we differ tonight is the method by which we achieve that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=2670)|
| 0:44:36| I think with this agreement, what we have in front of us is a guarantee of future growth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=2676)|
| 0:44:41| rather than future accrual of more fines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=2681)|
| 0:44:45| This contract commits knowledge to defined capital investment toward build-out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=2685)|
| 0:44:50| and I'm unwilling to sit back and watch knowledge continue to accrue fines| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=2690)|
| 0:44:55| without a commitment to investment in this community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=2695)|
| 0:44:57| And that's what we've done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=2697)|
| 0:44:59| And that's, to me, it's a risk-reward ratio.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=2699)|
| 0:45:02| And to me, the risk of going forward under the model under which we have been is not worth it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=2702)|
| 0:45:07| It's not working.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=2707)|
| 0:45:10| Someone made the comment they're not going to abandon their system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=2710)|
| 0:45:13| No, they're not going to abandon their system, but they have no,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=2713)|
| 0:45:16| I don't know that the incentive is there to continue to build-out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=2716)|
| 0:45:19| In today's market and in today's economy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=2719)|
| 0:45:22| And this amended agreement, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=2722)|
| 0:45:24| provides a better shot at getting more service to more people in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=2724)|
| 0:45:28| And we are beholden to those citizens to try to provide, in the best manner that we can,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=2728)|
| 0:45:33| competition in this arena.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=2733)|
| 0:45:35| And I think this is the best option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=2735)|
| 0:45:37| I'm going to go to Councilman Bailey because he hasn't spoken yet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=2737)|
| 0:45:39| and then I'll come back to the others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=2739)|
| 0:45:41| You know, I met with Mr. Johnson as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=2741)|
| 0:45:43| and I was pleased to hear from his perspective exactly why things had not turned out like the original agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=2743)|
| 0:45:50| And, Felix, you touched on that a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=2750)|
| 0:45:52| And I think for the viewers and watching on television and those in the audience,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=2752)|
| 0:45:57| it's only fair that they sort of be privy to some of the financial obstacles that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=2757)|
| 0:46:04| the money, the capital that you weren't able to find like you originally thought you were.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=2764)|
| 0:46:09| In terms of where you started and where you're going and so forth, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=2769)|
| 0:46:13| I can't go back to that April 8th time when this contract was met,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=2773)|
| 0:46:19| why we started in Fountain City and why we started in West Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=2779)|
| 0:46:22| I don't know the rationale there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=2782)|
| 0:46:24| I'm sure there's a story behind that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=2784)|
| 0:46:26| What I'm interested in is what is the best option going forward?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=2786)|
| 0:46:30| What's the best opportunity for competition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=2790)|
| 0:46:33| Because that's what all of us, low income, middle income, affluent people, that's the issue at hand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=2793)|
| 0:46:39| And I'm not sure, Mr. Martin, did you supply this council maps of the growth?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=2799)|
| 0:46:44| And have you done any sort of statistics on, well, okay, because I saw them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=2804)|
| 0:46:49| And I looked at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=2809)|
| 0:46:51| And I've heard some things that I'm not too pleased about hearing, which I'll leave aside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=2811)|
| 0:46:57| But the biggest thing is what's in the best interest going forward?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=2817)|
| 0:47:02| And I think what this administration has come forward with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=2822)|
| 0:47:05| and a lot of what Ms. Roddy and the mayor talked about earlier is what I'm interested in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=2825)|
| 0:47:10| And I'm going to support it because a lot of things are potentially, you know, could happen down the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=2830)|
| 0:47:18| It all depends on the economy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=2838)|
| 0:47:19| It all depends on money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=2839)|
| 0:47:21| And so I just hope that you can do what you say, keep us informed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=2841)|
| 0:47:27| And I look Mr. Johnson in the eye, a very credible business person, and I believe in his commitment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=2847)|
| 0:47:36| Councilman Bailey, if you do remember, our CEO, Roger Johnson,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=2856)|
| 0:47:41| has agreed that he would come to the city before the council once a year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=2861)|
| 0:47:47| and take questions and explain the progress that technology is making towards completing the build-out in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=2867)|
| 0:47:55| And I believe he made that commitment to almost every councilman that we had meetings with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=2875)|
| 0:48:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=2881)|
| 0:48:04| And we'll go to Vice Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=2884)|
| 0:48:05| Thank you, Mr. Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=2885)|
| 0:48:06| Let me also make something perfectly clear for our viewing audience,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=2886)|
| 0:48:10| because when I talk about not only South Knoxville, East Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=2890)|
| 0:48:16| I want to make sure people are very clear, and we heard the reference to KCDC also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=2896)|
| 0:48:20| When I say East Knoxville, sometimes people think I'm only talking about Five Points, Magnolia.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=2900)|
| 0:48:25| I'm talking about all of the 6th District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=2905)|
| 0:48:29| Every square inch of it is not in this plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=2909)|
| 0:48:33| I'm not just talking about Five Points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=2913)|
| 0:48:35| I'm not talking about Burlington.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=2915)|
| 0:48:37| I'm not talking about Walter P. Taylor Homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=2917)|
| 0:48:40| I'm not talking about Town View Terrace or the Vistas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=2920)|
| 0:48:42| I'm talking about every inch of the 6th District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=2922)|
| 0:48:45| That's downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=2925)|
| 0:48:47| That goes all the way to West High School, all the way to Holston Hills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=2927)|
| 0:48:50| It's out of this plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=2930)|
| 0:48:52| And we just heard him say, I can't tell you if I'll ever get there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=2932)|
| 0:48:56| This contract ends in 2015, seven years from now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=2936)|
| 0:49:01| And Councilman Frost made a very valid point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=2941)|
| 0:49:04| Based on the figures that are put in this contract,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=2944)|
| 0:49:07| they will not be able to get there with the expenditure funds they're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=2947)|
| 0:49:11| So what we're saying is that's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=2951)|
| 0:49:14| We're saying that's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=2954)|
| 0:49:16| That's all right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=2956)|
| 0:49:17| Sometimes we have to say, no, it's not okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=2957)|
| 0:49:20| No, it's not all right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=2960)|
| 0:49:21| And if the best you can do is pay us our $420,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=2961)|
| 0:49:24| we'll take that and try to use it as an incentive to recruit somebody else there to come and do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=2964)|
| 0:49:29| But I want to make sure that people understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=2969)|
| 0:49:31| I'm not just talking about Five Points or Burlington or Walter P. Taylor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=2971)|
| 0:49:36| I'm talking about every square inch of the 6th District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=2976)|
| 0:49:38| And I think every square inch of the 1st District is excluded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=2978)|
| 0:49:42| It's nowhere in this plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=2982)|
| 0:49:44| Not one house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=2984)|
| 0:49:45| Not one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=2985)|
| 0:49:46| And I don't know if there ever will be under this contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=2986)|
| 0:49:49| And that's just unacceptable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=2989)|
| 0:49:51| Councilman Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=2991)|
| 0:49:52| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=2992)|
| 0:49:53| I guess I'm concerned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=2993)|
| 0:49:55| You know, granted, I've never run a multimillion-dollar company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=2995)|
| 0:49:58| But at some level, I think that I would know what I'm going to be doing with the money I'm spending in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=2998)|
| 0:50:04| And I guess let me even ask another question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=3004)|
| 0:50:06| There's a bunch of money that you're spending to settle the current outstanding fines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=3006)|
| 0:50:12| I mean, I think it's $500,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=3012)|
| 0:50:14| Where is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=3014)|
| 0:50:15| And that's going to be used on build-out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=3015)|
| 0:50:16| Where is that going to be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=3016)|
| 0:50:19| I would ask Jason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=3019)|
| 0:50:20| We've already expended that money in the first quarter of this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=3020)|
| 0:50:25| Jason, where are we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=3025)|
| 0:50:30| We're currently building in the Dean Hill area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=3030)|
| 0:50:35| Bad answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=3035)|
| 0:50:37| It's an honest answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=3037)|
| 0:50:39| I mean, it's an honest answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=3039)|
| 0:50:40| You've got, you know, I mean, one of the interesting things that's cool about this is people accuse you of cherry-picking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=3040)|
| 0:50:46| And I say, you know, I've got knowledge and Bill Haslam doesn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=3046)|
| 0:50:49| That ain't cherry-picking unless you're really stupid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=3049)|
| 0:50:53| But it feels like you could be building out towards East.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=3053)|
| 0:50:56| You're not that far from where East Knoxville is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=3056)|
| 0:50:59| And Dean Hill is a long way from East Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=3059)|
| 0:51:02| You're not too far from South Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=3062)|
| 0:51:04| Dean Hill is a long way from South Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=3064)|
| 0:51:06| And I think this is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=3066)|
| 0:51:07| I agree with Ms. Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=3067)|
| 0:51:08| This is the way to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=3068)|
| 0:51:09| This is a much better plan than just saying give us money because it gets service to the people of the city of Knoxville, which is what we want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=3069)|
| 0:51:18| But I think we need to hear a commitment that you're going to build in the areas that are least served now and not, you know, not just.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=3078)|
| 0:51:26| I mean, nothing wrong with Dean Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=3086)|
| 0:51:29| The second district is a wonderful place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=3089)|
| 0:51:32| But I think we've got areas of the city that do need more of this and will benefit from it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=3092)|
| 0:51:38| Well, as I said last time, I would have been happy for the second district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=3098)|
| 0:51:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=3105)|
| 0:51:46| Councilman Woodhull.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=3106)|
| 0:51:48| If our core issue is trust, we're just assuming that whatever it is we agree to is going to be built out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=3108)|
| 0:51:57| How are we going to verify that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=3117)|
| 0:51:58| Are we going to have inspectors?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=3118)|
| 0:52:00| I don't think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=3120)|
| 0:52:01| I mean, I understand the core issue should be trust.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=3121)|
| 0:52:03| But I think the core issue is you're picking the best of two bad alternatives, in my opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=3123)|
| 0:52:13| I just don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=3133)|
| 0:52:14| I had a wonderful meeting with you and also the CEO.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=3134)|
| 0:52:18| I appreciated the time you spent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=3138)|
| 0:52:21| And I just don't get why East Knoxville is not a viable market for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=3141)|
| 0:52:29| My experience is that it's a very rich urban market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=3149)|
| 0:52:34| And even the CEO admitted, he said, you're the first one that's actually said that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=3154)|
| 0:52:39| So I'm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=3159)|
| 0:52:41| It's a very viable market for knowledge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=3161)|
| 0:52:46| The economics of buildout is we have all the infrastructure built within the confined area of the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=3166)|
| 0:52:55| So the most economic, the way to get the most services to customers in Knoxville is to continue to expand off of the existing network.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=3175)|
| 0:53:05| And that also provides more revenues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=3185)|
| 0:53:08| It provides a compounding effect and creates more opportunity to continue to build and provide services to the citizens of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=3188)|
| 0:53:19| When we started to build in Knoxville, the way we started to build in Knoxville is not the profitable way to build a network.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=3199)|
| 0:53:28| We built that way because that was the agreement between the city council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=3208)|
| 0:53:32| So the city council wanted us to start this area in this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=3212)|
| 0:53:36| So as a result, from an economics or financial economics perspective, we're stuck with the original agreement and how the buildout was required.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=3216)|
| 0:53:45| We need to edge out as we continue to edge out from the existing network.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=3225)|
| 0:53:51| And our commitment is we're going to build all the networks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=3231)|
| 0:53:55| And there's no cherry picking on behalf of technology whatsoever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=3235)|
| 0:54:02| I'll just let me just say this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=3242)|
| 0:54:03| You said it's the best of two options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=3243)|
| 0:54:05| Well, if the second option really doesn't fly, then it seems to me that the best option would be just to base our decision on principle if the second one really is not going to go anywhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=3245)|
| 0:54:18| And we can't prove it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=3258)|
| 0:54:19| I mean, that's a decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=3259)|
| 0:54:21| I mean, I think what we can only do is deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=3261)|
| 0:54:24| We have to deal with solutions as an administration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=3264)|
| 0:54:26| We have to come and recommend to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=3266)|
| 0:54:27| And so we've looked at that and said we don't like where we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=3267)|
| 0:54:29| I mean, we don't like where we are either, by the way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=3269)|
| 0:54:32| And I'd love to get up and yell and scream about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=3272)|
| 0:54:34| But, in the end, we've got to say here's what we propose to do about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=3274)|
| 0:54:37| So, given that, that's why we said it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=3277)|
| 0:54:39| I think I'm going to go to Councilman Hall because he hasn't spoken yet, and then we'll come to the others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=3279)|
| 0:54:43| Well, I met with the knowledge of folks, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=3283)|
| 0:54:47| And I still share all the concerns that have been mentioned here, especially Vice Mayor Brown and Councilman Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=3287)|
| 0:54:56| I guess my question is, and this may be to Ms. Poplin, in this deal, say they don't abide by this, what happens?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=3296)|
| 0:55:07| We are just amending certain provisions of the agreement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=3307)|
| 0:55:10| so we still have the provisions that deal with enforcement built into the original agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=3310)|
| 0:55:16| Is that the $5,000 a month?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=3316)|
| 0:55:18| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=3318)|
| 0:55:19| And the liquidated damages provision, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=3319)|
| 0:55:23| Well, apparently, and I can't speak for the knowledge of folks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=3323)|
| 0:55:26| but apparently the $5,000 a month is not a real incentive to motivate them to do anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=3326)|
| 0:55:33| And so, maybe that, when you're revisiting this, maybe that should have been revisited, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=3333)|
| 0:55:41| Unfortunately, that's, we can only deal with a contract that we were handed off from our predecessors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=3341)|
| 0:55:46| And that's the only penalty we have to use at our disposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=3346)|
| 0:55:51| If you're amending, aren't we amending that contract through this agreement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=3351)|
| 0:55:56| Right, but why would they agree to more of a penalty than they're taking right now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=3356)|
| 0:56:01| If you're getting spanked once, you're not going to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=3361)|
| 0:56:03| If they're acting in good faith, like they say they are, that shouldn't be a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=3363)|
| 0:56:08| Yeah, I'm not going to fight their fight in terms of financing, et cetera,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=3368)|
| 0:56:11| but we can only enforce the contract that we have to enforce, unfortunately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=3371)|
| 0:56:15| So, I'm going to go to Councilman Hoeklis next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=3375)|
| 0:56:18| I'm not sure who goes up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=3378)|
| 0:56:20| Felix, I have a question for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=3380)|
| 0:56:22| You said, you asked Jason, and he said you're currently building out in Dean Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=3382)|
| 0:56:28| Did you all supply the data?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=3388)|
| 0:56:30| Are you familiar with this map?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=3390)|
| 0:56:32| Did you supply this map or the data that's represented in this map?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=3392)|
| 0:56:36| Knowledge you did provide that, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=3396)|
| 0:56:38| Well, the green area indicates, according to the legend,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=3398)|
| 0:56:42| it's a knowledge and service area at the time the map was produced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=3402)|
| 0:56:46| It includes all of Dean Hill, which implies for council members looking at this map,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=3406)|
| 0:56:53| we're already servicing this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=3413)|
| 0:56:55| And yet you're telling me that you're just now building out Dean Hill,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=3415)|
| 0:56:59| whereas that's not what this map says.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=3419)|
| 0:57:02| That's a good question, Councilman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=3422)|
| 0:57:04| What I'm trying to explain is we already have network built throughout Dean Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=3424)|
| 0:57:08| We don't necessarily have Dean Hill completely built.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=3428)|
| 0:57:11| Because we're continuing to build and expand off the existing network| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=3431)|
| 0:57:15| and continue to put more homes onto the network.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=3435)|
| 0:57:20| So Dean Hill was the reason Dean Hill was built is because, can you still hear me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=3440)|
| 0:57:25| is because it's within the build-out that we already have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=3445)|
| 0:57:29| And the most efficient way to construct new plant is to continue to expand from the existing plant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=3449)|
| 0:57:34| I mean, I will tell you now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=3454)|
| 0:57:36| Have you passed all the homes in Dean Hill or not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=3456)|
| 0:57:39| We have not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=3459)|
| 0:57:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=3460)|
| 0:57:41| Well, see, what that says to me is I don't even know what this map means then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=3461)|
| 0:57:46| Because I thought the green shaded area implied that you'd passed every home,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=3466)|
| 0:57:52| every structure, whatever, in the green shaded area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=3472)|
| 0:57:57| And now you're telling me that's not true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=3477)|
| 0:58:00| So, I mean, I'm really beginning to get more and more concerned about credibility here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=3480)|
| 0:58:08| I would say this, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=3488)|
| 0:58:09| Knowledge is disappointing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=3489)|
| 0:58:11| Knowledge would have liked to have raised a billion dollars in the year 2000, which was our intent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=3491)|
| 0:58:18| We're as disappointed as the City Council that we don't have the entire market built out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=3498)|
| 0:58:23| And for that, the more we build out, the more money that we make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=3503)|
| 0:58:28| But, unfortunately, we're in a situation where you just cannot finance the build.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=3508)|
| 0:58:35| So, with respect to knowledge that's given up internally generated funds, you know, we compete for capital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=3515)|
| 0:58:43| There's 12 markets in knowledge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=3523)|
| 0:58:45| And we're actually committing money to the City of Knoxville that may even earn a smaller return| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=3525)|
| 0:58:50| than we could earn in other marketplaces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=3530)|
| 0:58:53| And we are willing to commit to the City of Knoxville a commitment of funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=3533)|
| 0:59:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=3542)|
| 0:59:03| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=3543)|
| 0:59:04| Councilman Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=3544)|
| 0:59:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=3545)|
| 0:59:06| Mr. Boak, could you reference the point that I wanted to explore?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=3546)|
| 0:59:08| And that was that the original contract with the City of Knoxville mandated that knowledge begin in certain areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=3548)|
| 0:59:15| And, Ms. Poplin, can you address where those areas were and why perhaps the city made that decision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=3555)|
| 0:59:20| rather than leaving that up to a business concern to what would be most efficient and economical from a business model?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=3560)|
| 0:59:27| I can't actually address the reasoning, but I can tell you what's in the agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=3567)|
| 0:59:31| It's in Section 5 of the agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=3571)|
| 0:59:33| And it states that knowledge will treat all areas and neighborhoods in the franchise area on a substantially equal basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=3573)|
| 0:59:40| And they agree to commence construction in no fewer than two geographically distinct areas at the same time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=3580)|
| 0:59:48| And it sets forth the north, south, east, and west,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=3588)|
| 0:59:52| such that cable services will be available to potential subscribers in each of the areas at substantially the same time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=3592)|
| 0:59:59| But then it goes on to say that it's understood that knowledge will begin construction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=3599)|
| 1:00:03| just southeast of Dutchtown Road exit on Pellissippi Parkway and just east of Black Oak Ridge on Broadway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=3603)|
| 1:00:11| So was this a three-party agreement with the county and the city?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=3611)|
| 1:00:15| No, this was just an agreement with the City of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=3615)|
| 1:00:19| So the city agreement mandated that their original two nodes or nuclei be in specified locations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=3619)|
| 1:00:28| And, I mean, to me that doesn't make sense that a government is telling a business where, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=3628)|
| 1:00:34| what's the best model for them to build out their system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=3634)|
| 1:00:38| And what we're hearing is that perhaps that wasn't the best model.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=3638)|
| 1:00:41| But that's what we're left with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=3641)|
| 1:00:42| And if you look at this map, you know, you've got a crescent over sort of the northern tier of the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=3642)|
| 1:00:49| that has been built out from those two nuclei.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=3649)|
| 1:00:51| And, I mean, I would love to have competitive service in my neighborhood, but I don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=3651)|
| 1:00:55| And it would require, you know, flying over hundreds of homes to get to where I am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=3655)|
| 1:00:59| And the reality is the original contract, for whatever reason, specified that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=3659)|
| 1:01:04| The build-out has come from those two nuclei.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=3664)|
| 1:01:07| And, you know, I don't know whether it was intentional to disregard the 1st District and disregard the 6th District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=3667)|
| 1:01:15| I share the outrage that there are citizens all over the city that don't have service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=3675)|
| 1:01:19| But I think we owe it to our citizens to give them the best possible solution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=3679)|
| 1:01:23| And I feel like this amended agreement is the best possible alternative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=3683)|
| 1:01:27| Councilman Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=3687)|
| 1:01:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=3688)|
| 1:01:29| I respectfully submit not to cry for Knology in their contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=3689)|
| 1:01:32| Knology approached the city of Knoxville wanting to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=3692)|
| 1:01:35| When this was passed on second reading on April 18, 2000, I've spoken to their general counsel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=3695)|
| 1:01:41| They had their team of lawyers review this document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=3701)|
| 1:01:45| On April 18, 2000, the CEO of Knology was out there at that audience, spoke at that podium,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=3705)|
| 1:01:52| saying, we want to do this, we're going to bring competition to the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=3712)|
| 1:01:58| What do you propose that we do now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=3718)|
| 1:02:00| I'm not through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=3720)|
| 1:02:01| Hang on, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=3721)|
| 1:02:03| I understand from Knology that they need for economic terms to build contiguously to areas where they are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=3723)|
| 1:02:12| That's why they're going to take time coming around to different parts of town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=3732)|
| 1:02:19| But that's going to mean that South Knoxville is going to be the very last.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=3739)|
| 1:02:24| I mean, I ask point blank what was going to happen to South Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=3744)|
| 1:02:30| Now, I alluded to earlier, I had an email exchange with Larry Martin and Debbie Poplin about the enforcement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=3750)|
| 1:02:38| and the franchise issue and whether or not the city can yank it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=3758)|
| 1:02:44| And I was told that the law department has the opinion that it can't be yanked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=3764)|
| 1:02:50| Is that still correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=3770)|
| 1:02:51| That opinion is based on the fact that they're willing to pay the liquidated damages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=3771)|
| 1:02:55| In order for us to go through the termination process, there would have to be a default in the agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=3775)|
| 1:03:02| And right now, they are offering to cure the default by paying the liquidated damages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=3782)|
| 1:03:07| So absent that, I don't see that there would be a default that we could pursue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=3787)|
| 1:03:11| So we're talking about amending a contract to do what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=3791)|
| 1:03:18| There's no greater enforcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=3798)|
| 1:03:20| We're not being allowed to yank it under the amended contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=3800)|
| 1:03:24| You know, like I said earlier, hindsight is 20-20.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=3804)|
| 1:03:28| This is a very unfortunate situation, but it affects 60, 65 percent of the residents of the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=3808)|
| 1:03:39| I think we should do better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=3819)|
| 1:03:41| We should have some clear benchmarks, not that we're going to spend X number of dollars,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=3821)|
| 1:03:46| that we know that we're going to get to more than 1,300 people in one year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=3826)|
| 1:03:50| compound that by 10 percent, get to 1,300 plus 130 more, and compound out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=3830)|
| 1:03:57| I mean, how long is it going to take?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=3837)|
| 1:04:01| I think we need some absolutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=3841)|
| 1:04:03| So what do you propose that we do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=3843)|
| 1:04:05| Well, I think personally that we should, you know, the law department and the administration,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=3845)|
| 1:04:10| I don't know who all was involved in working on this, you know, it might get passed tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=3850)|
| 1:04:16| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=3856)|
| 1:04:17| If it doesn't get passed, it should go back to the drawing board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=3857)|
| 1:04:20| and try to get something more absolute and more concrete.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=3860)|
| 1:04:26| You've heard them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=3866)|
| 1:04:27| They're not really willing to give us anything more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=3867)|
| 1:04:29| I mean, I'd love to do that too, but I think we are where we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=3869)|
| 1:04:32| None of us like the contract we're dealing with, so what are we going to do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=3872)|
| 1:04:36| Well, you know, in my great conversation with Mr. Johnson, Mr. Boccucci,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=3876)|
| 1:04:41| and others from knowledge, they are obviously suffering a public relations mess right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=3881)|
| 1:04:50| They want to put it to bed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=3890)|
| 1:04:52| I don't blame them one bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=3892)|
| 1:04:56| But we need to use what we have at our disposal, whether it is prolonging this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=3896)|
| 1:05:03| assuming this doesn't go forward tonight, and try to come up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=3903)|
| 1:05:07| I think we can do better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=3907)|
| 1:05:09| We're here for the shareholders of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=3909)|
| 1:05:11| We're not here for the shareholders of Knology.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=3911)|
| 1:05:14| I understand that, but if it's our law department's view,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=3914)|
| 1:05:16| all we can do is continue to fine them for $5,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=3916)|
| 1:05:20| and we either do what we're doing or we take the liquidated damages and go on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=3920)|
| 1:05:25| I mean, we're open, but somebody else give us a specific idea of what to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=3925)|
| 1:05:30| Let me ask this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=3930)|
| 1:05:33| Councilman Hall kind of asked a question earlier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=3933)|
| 1:05:38| and I want to make sure I'm clear with the answer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=3938)|
| 1:05:40| because I haven't looked at the contract since back the last time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=3940)|
| 1:05:44| because I had my mind made up based on what I heard then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=3944)|
| 1:05:48| Is there any new additional enforcement mechanisms in this amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=3948)|
| 1:05:53| other than the $5,000 penalty that we already have?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=3953)|
| 1:05:56| No, there isn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=3956)|
| 1:05:58| So what's to stop them from next month saying, oops,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=3958)|
| 1:06:01| we're not even going to do what we just said in the second contract| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=3961)|
| 1:06:04| and start giving us $5,000 then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=3964)|
| 1:06:06| We'll be in the same spot we are right now, but just haven't left them off the hook today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=3966)|
| 1:06:11| No additional penalty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=3971)|
| 1:06:13| There's no additional requirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=3973)|
| 1:06:15| They could say next year, well, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=3975)|
| 1:06:17| it looks like our business model is not working out, guys,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=3977)|
| 1:06:20| and we can't even do what we're talking about doing, $1,300 a year up through 2015,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=3980)|
| 1:06:26| and we're going to start writing you a $5,000 check right now every month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=3986)|
| 1:06:30| If they could do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=3990)|
| 1:06:31| then we are not in any better position to hold them accountable by passing this right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=3991)|
| 1:06:36| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=3996)|
| 1:06:37| That's a great question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=3997)|
| 1:06:38| Debbie, if they don't pay us the $400,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=3998)|
| 1:06:41| we agree to allow them to invest the $400, and they don't invest the $400,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=4001)|
| 1:06:44| that's a great question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=4004)|
| 1:06:46| How can we enforce them to invest the $400 that they already owe us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=4006)|
| 1:06:49| Then that would trigger the default mechanisms that we have built in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=4009)|
| 1:06:53| which would be the notice that they are in default,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=4013)|
| 1:06:57| and then they are given a period of time to cure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=4017)|
| 1:07:00| And in the event that they don't, then we call a public hearing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=4020)|
| 1:07:03| and there's a hearing to find that they're in default, and it would trigger that process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=4023)|
| 1:07:07| But if they start paying the $5,000 and are not in default,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=4027)|
| 1:07:11| there's nothing more we can do but just start accepting it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=4031)|
| 1:07:13| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=4033)|
| 1:07:15| If they've invested the $400,000 that they're supposed to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=4035)|
| 1:07:18| If they invest the $400,000, which you said they've already spent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=4038)|
| 1:07:21| Well, that's the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=4041)|
| 1:07:22| That actually is a great question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=4042)|
| 1:07:24| That's not our understanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=4044)|
| 1:07:25| We're counting on you, this $400,000 you owe us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=4045)|
| 1:07:28| we're counting on that being new spend, not stuff you've already spent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=4048)|
| 1:07:31| So you need to clarify that for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=4051)|
| 1:07:32| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=4052)|
| 1:07:33| We have spent at least that amount of money on new build in the first quarter of 2000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=4053)|
| 1:07:39| No, no, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=4059)|
| 1:07:40| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=4060)|
| 1:07:41| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=4061)|
| 1:07:43| Remember this, our option is this, you either pay us $400,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=4063)|
| 1:07:46| or you take that $400,000 and use it to extend the network.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=4066)|
| 1:07:49| We're not looking for $400,000 that you've already spent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=4069)|
| 1:07:51| because if that's the case, we'll just take our $400,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=4071)|
| 1:07:53| You need to tell us you're going to spend a new $400,000 going forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=4073)|
| 1:07:56| and show us that you've done that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=4076)|
| 1:07:58| Well, with all due respect, Mayor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=4078)|
| 1:08:00| we took in excess of $400,000 in the first quarter of 2008| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=4080)|
| 1:08:06| and expanded our network to new homes in the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=4086)|
| 1:08:10| Remember, we're making a business deal that's the best of two alternatives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=4090)|
| 1:08:13| Given that, if you're not going to spend another $400,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=4093)|
| 1:08:16| we ought to just take our money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=4096)|
| 1:08:18| Exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=4098)|
| 1:08:20| You owe credit for something you've already done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=4100)|
| 1:08:22| and we haven't approved the contract yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=4102)|
| 1:08:23| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=4103)|
| 1:08:25| We're approving the contract tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=4105)|
| 1:08:26| Well, I mean, with all due respect,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=4106)|
| 1:08:28| Nology is moving on and building a new network in the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=4108)|
| 1:08:34| I think that's probably in the best interest of the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=4114)|
| 1:08:39| I'm sorry to take over so much of the conversation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=4119)|
| 1:08:41| but I think what you hear is because of the history.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=4121)|
| 1:08:44| I understand if you can't get financing to build that, you can't get it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=4124)|
| 1:08:47| I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=4127)|
| 1:08:48| But there is a basic issue of we have to know that you're going to do what you said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=4128)|
| 1:08:52| and what you're saying is you're going to spend an additional $400,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=4132)|
| 1:08:55| instead of giving us that $400,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=4135)|
| 1:08:57| Now, I'm not saying everybody's even going to vote for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=4137)|
| 1:08:59| It might not pass, but if it does pass,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=4139)|
| 1:09:01| that's the business deal that this council made if it does pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=4141)|
| 1:09:05| That $400,000 starts tomorrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=4145)|
| 1:09:06| Yeah, that's $400,000 new, or if not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=4146)|
| 1:09:08| we're better off just having you all pay us the liquidated damages and go on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=4148)|
| 1:09:13| We need to be really clear about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=4153)|
| 1:09:16| Nology, in good faith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=4156)|
| 1:09:18| I mean, we didn't have to build anything except for pay liquidated damages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=4158)|
| 1:09:23| Nology, in good faith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=4163)|
| 1:09:24| We believe that the city council is going to approve this agreement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=4164)|
| 1:09:28| because it was in the best interest of both Nology and the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=4168)|
| 1:09:32| So we went ahead and engineered, created, spent money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=4172)|
| 1:09:36| and began building that work in the city of Knoxville at the beginning of this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=4176)|
| 1:09:40| I believe that we're going to probably spend, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=4180)|
| 1:09:45| probably in excess of $1.5 million this year in the city of Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=4185)|
| 1:09:50| which is in excess of the $400,000 in the 5%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=4190)|
| 1:09:54| Well, I'm not a mind reader, but I think if there's any chance to pass this tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=4194)|
| 1:09:57| you're going to have to make a guarantee that that's $400,000 new.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=4197)|
| 1:10:01| Again, I'm not even presuming you'll get 5 the way that we're proposing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=4201)|
| 1:10:04| but I'm pretty sure it's going to take a guarantee that there will be $400,000 of new money spent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=4204)|
| 1:10:09| I'm sorry to talk so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=4209)|
| 1:10:10| Councilman Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=4210)|
| 1:10:11| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=4211)|
| 1:10:12| Ms. Pilo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=4212)|
| 1:10:13| Let me go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=4213)|
| 1:10:14| Ms. Pilo is next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=4214)|
| 1:10:15| I'm sorry, and then I'll come to you, Councilwoman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=4215)|
| 1:10:16| That was a question because your comment that you'd already spent it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=4216)|
| 1:10:20| and we hadn't approved the contract is so contrary to our conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=4220)|
| 1:10:28| And my willingness to second-think this and think this is a good reason for me to second-think it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=4228)|
| 1:10:36| you know, it's just out the window.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=4236)|
| 1:10:39| I'm frustrated, and I'm totally frustrated that you don't understand the position that puts us in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=4239)|
| 1:10:46| Now, you know, we've talked about outrage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=4246)|
| 1:10:50| I share the outrage that Councilman Brown and Councilman Frost have expressed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=4250)|
| 1:10:56| and it's gracious I share that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=4256)|
| 1:10:58| I'm totally outraged that I feel that I was misinformed in our conversation together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=4258)|
| 1:11:06| I don't think we'll apologize for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=4266)|
| 1:11:09| The only point I'm making is knowledge is continued to build.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=4269)|
| 1:11:12| I understand that, and I understand that that was your obligation because you were under contract to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=4272)|
| 1:11:17| Another question I've got, and it may be just a little bit late to ask it, but I never got to ask it at the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=4277)|
| 1:11:22| Looking at this map, I noticed that a part of the service area is in the county, West Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=4282)|
| 1:11:29| Is it built out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=4289)|
| 1:11:32| Portions of West Knox County?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=4292)|
| 1:11:34| Yeah, beyond the city limits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=4294)|
| 1:11:38| Portions are, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=4298)|
| 1:11:40| I mean, that astounds me because we're talking about the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=4300)|
| 1:11:43| and I'm looking at a map that has your service area west of the city limits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=4303)|
| 1:11:51| and some very nice residential sections, which are having the benefits of that competitive pricing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=4311)|
| 1:12:00| which the citizens of Knoxville are not having,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=4320)|
| 1:12:03| and yet you saw to it to build out west of the city limits during a contract with the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=4323)|
| 1:12:11| Again, Councilwoman, our build-out was based on the entire Knoxville market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=4331)|
| 1:12:18| And, again, we have to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=4338)|
| 1:12:19| Wait a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=4339)|
| 1:12:20| You're in contract with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=4340)|
| 1:12:22| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=4342)|
| 1:12:24| But we were required to build in two locations within the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=4344)|
| 1:12:29| And if you look at our plan, it's contiguously being built out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=4349)|
| 1:12:35| Well, someone explain to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=4355)|
| 1:12:36| Mr. Frost actually decides now that he wants to at least offer a. . .| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=4356)|
| 1:12:40| Don't faint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=4360)|
| 1:12:41| I'm going to stick up for you for about 30 seconds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=4361)|
| 1:12:43| Oh, heck, help me out here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=4363)|
| 1:12:45| Knowlogy has a franchise agreement, likewise, with Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=4365)|
| 1:12:48| They are not in compliance with their franchise with Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=4368)|
| 1:12:52| County Commission about two years ago passed a resolution granting them additional time to come into compliance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=4372)|
| 1:12:58| So they were supposed to have had all applicable areas of the county built out as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=4378)|
| 1:13:03| So they're incentivized there, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=4383)|
| 1:13:05| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=4385)|
| 1:13:06| With all due respect, Councilwoman, I'm not here to talk about Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=4386)|
| 1:13:10| Well, I realize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=4390)|
| 1:13:11| But it's Knowlogy's belief, based on the density requirements and the build-out requirements that are in the Knox County franchise,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=4391)|
| 1:13:17| that we've met the requirements of the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=4397)|
| 1:13:19| So, now, a resolution was passed by a county commission giving you all additional time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=4399)|
| 1:13:24| Are you saying since that time you've complied with the county franchise agreement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=4404)|
| 1:13:28| There's a density requirement in the franchise in the county as well as the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=4408)|
| 1:13:35| And we've built to those density requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=4415)|
| 1:13:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=4417)|
| 1:13:38| If you stick up for Knowlogy just a little bit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=4418)|
| 1:13:40| their 400-something or half a million dollar expenditure that they've already done in their first quarter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=4420)|
| 1:13:45| that's what they were supposed to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=4425)|
| 1:13:47| That's what their contract said they were to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=4427)|
| 1:13:49| No more, no less.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=4429)|
| 1:13:50| They're just running behind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=4430)|
| 1:13:52| Now, you know, they spin it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=4432)|
| 1:13:56| That's great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=4436)|
| 1:13:57| I think some more was supposed to be coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=4437)|
| 1:14:00| A lot more was supposed to be coming because they are four years and four days too late.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=4440)|
| 1:14:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=4447)|
| 1:14:08| Councilman Bailey, and then I'll come back over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=4448)|
| 1:14:10| Mayor, I want to ask you this question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=4450)|
| 1:14:12| But I met with Roger and Felix and Jason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=4452)|
| 1:14:15| And the intent, what they were telling me, is over and above what they've already spent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=4455)|
| 1:14:23| and what they have budgeted, that they were going to take this $400,000 in addition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=4463)|
| 1:14:30| and sort of speed things up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=4470)|
| 1:14:33| That's what I took away from it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=4473)|
| 1:14:36| Right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=4476)|
| 1:14:37| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=4477)|
| 1:14:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=4478)|
| 1:14:39| Because I think you kind of confused us a little bit by saying, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=4479)|
| 1:14:41| we're going to do even more than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=4481)|
| 1:14:43| But I think what we're interested in hearing is you're going to take this penalty money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=4483)|
| 1:14:47| and throw it back in and move things along even quicker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=4487)|
| 1:14:50| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=4490)|
| 1:14:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=4491)|
| 1:14:52| I apologize for confusing you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=4492)|
| 1:14:53| The other thing is, Mayor, you know, how do we watch?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=4493)|
| 1:14:55| How do we enforce that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=4495)|
| 1:14:56| Debbie, I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=4496)|
| 1:14:57| You know, how do we anticipate seeing this happen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=4497)|
| 1:15:05| On the reporting requirements?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=4505)|
| 1:15:06| Is that what you're –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=4506)|
| 1:15:07| Well, I mean –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=4507)|
| 1:15:08| How do we make sure they spent – that they actually do spend – if we let them keep this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=4508)|
| 1:15:11| it's like they spent –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=4511)|
| 1:15:12| It sounds like things to just sort of give us a wink and a nod, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=4512)|
| 1:15:14| But, I mean, you know, if you see Mr. Johnson and you talk to him and you listen to him,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=4514)|
| 1:15:19| he's going to obligate this $400,000 penalty money over and above what they're already doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=4519)|
| 1:15:25| to kind of in the nature to get this thing moving along and, you know, pay their dues up and go on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=4525)|
| 1:15:34| There are reporting requirements built into the original agreement, and so those would have to be followed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=4534)|
| 1:15:42| Mr. Becker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=4542)|
| 1:15:44| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=4544)|
| 1:15:45| A question for, I guess, knowledge and then one for Mr. Martin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=4545)|
| 1:15:49| Let me ask you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=4549)|
| 1:15:51| You said that you're planning this year to spend $1.5 million in additional build-out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=4551)|
| 1:15:59| As we look at the numbers today, and plans can change, but we believe that we'll spend approximately| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=4559)|
| 1:16:07| $1 million to $2 million in new build-out in the City of Knoxville for this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=4567)|
| 1:16:12| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=4572)|
| 1:16:13| Which is in excess of the contract that we're agreeing to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=4573)|
| 1:16:16| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=4576)|
| 1:16:17| And, again, it goes with the theory of this contract is to get the build-out done, which is important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=4577)|
| 1:16:22| I think there's a lot of concern on Council about where that build-out happens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=4582)|
| 1:16:26| And I guess, you know, again, if you're going to be spending a million extra dollars in build-out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=4586)|
| 1:16:31| where is the next area that gets built-out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=4591)|
| 1:16:34| What's your plan that you have?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=4594)|
| 1:16:37| Again, it's going to be an edge-out from the existing marketplace so that we can put as many new customers on the market| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=4597)|
| 1:16:45| to buy knowledge and services as soon as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=4605)|
| 1:16:48| And that benefits both knowledge and the city because we generate more revenue, we'll generate more taxes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=4608)|
| 1:16:53| and we'll generate more build-out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=4613)|
| 1:16:58| Well, so let me ask you, right now you're sort of north of the line of Buffett Mill Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=4618)|
| 1:17:04| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=4624)|
| 1:17:06| Is what you think is going to be happening is that you'll be building south of that in the coming year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=4626)|
| 1:17:15| That's the plan, yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=4635)|
| 1:17:16| That's the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=4636)|
| 1:17:17| Do you have an idea of how far south of that you're going to get this year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=4637)|
| 1:17:23| We don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=4643)|
| 1:17:24| Some of the issues that you have in terms of planning, there's a thing called Make Ready.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=4644)|
| 1:17:28| And so we rely on KUB and Bell South has a few poles and facilities on poles, for example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=4648)|
| 1:17:34| So there's what they call the National Electric Safety Code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=4654)|
| 1:17:38| So before we can place our cables on new poles, we have to rely on KUB and the other providers to move their facilities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=4658)|
| 1:17:45| so that we stay safety-compliant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=4665)|
| 1:17:48| We don't know when we do underground what we might hit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=4668)|
| 1:17:50| We might hit rock or we might hit other things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=4670)|
| 1:17:53| And I do want to say is the commitment that we're making in the amendment is knowledge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=4673)|
| 1:17:59| that believes that that is a minimum commitment that we're going to make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=4679)|
| 1:18:02| And we're very optimistic that we're going to be able to create more build-out than what's in the agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=4682)|
| 1:18:10| However, again, we don't want to be in a position of making a commitment to the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=4690)|
| 1:18:13| without knowing what's going to happen in terms of financial markets, subprime, the bubble, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=4693)|
| 1:18:23| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=4703)|
| 1:18:24| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=4704)|
| 1:18:25| Mr. Martin, sort of the interesting going on is the mayor has said consistently we have two bad choices| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=4705)|
| 1:18:32| and we're trying to choose the best one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=4712)|
| 1:18:34| I sort of argue and I think most of council would agree right now that we ought to be trying to make the option| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=4714)|
| 1:18:41| we're talking about even better than it is and it should be better than it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=4721)|
| 1:18:44| I know Mr. Frost has some concrete ideas on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=4724)|
| 1:18:48| Do you see any value in continuing to have the discussion to see if we can get a better agreement worked out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=4728)|
| 1:18:58| Should we be postponing this or do you just feel like this is as good as we're going to get?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=4738)|
| 1:19:04| Council Member Becker, we've spent a good bit of time, as you know, talking with technology about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=4744)|
| 1:19:10| I think this is a reasonable and worthwhile proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=4750)|
| 1:19:13| As we have said many times, clearly knowledge is not without choices here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=4753)|
| 1:19:20| They could simply pay the liquidated damages as has been pointed out, continue to pay the $5,000 a month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=4760)|
| 1:19:26| simply the cost of doing business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=4766)|
| 1:19:28| We also have the matter of the state legislation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=4768)|
| 1:19:31| Right now, knowledge has shown, I think, good faith toward the city of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=4771)|
| 1:19:36| in continuing with the local franchise and not opting to go to the state franchise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=4776)|
| 1:19:42| So I think this is reasonable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=4782)|
| 1:19:44| It's also noteworthy that based on the 1999 census information,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=4784)|
| 1:19:50| I assume that's the same as Council Member Frost's 2000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=4790)|
| 1:19:54| that they serve roughly 43% of the population of the households they serve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=4794)|
| 1:20:01| Over half of those have income less than $35,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=4801)|
| 1:20:05| So I don't think that there is, at least from an income standpoint, cherry-picking that's been going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=4805)|
| 1:20:13| They did start at poles, you know, different rather far-removed places within the city to do a build-out of the full city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=4813)|
| 1:20:23| That, coupled with what happened in their financial environment, created the situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=4823)|
| 1:20:29| I think we and they both, as has been expressed very well tonight, are disappointed with where we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=4829)|
| 1:20:36| But I think this is our best solution and is a solution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=4836)|
| 1:20:39| and that's what we're charged to do here is to find a solution that continues to provide competition within our city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=4839)|
| 1:20:45| and to get build-out to other citizens and give them a choice on their cable service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=4845)|
| 1:20:50| Let me just add one other thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=4850)|
| 1:20:53| You actually asked a great question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=4853)|
| 1:20:54| There's one other thing that factors on to the kind of elephant that's in the tent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=4854)|
| 1:20:58| The existing state legislation hasn't passed yet, but all likelihood is it will,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=4858)|
| 1:21:04| would allow folks like Nology and them specifically to go apply for a state license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=4864)|
| 1:21:09| In that case, they'd only have to build out a certain percentage of their market,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=4869)|
| 1:21:13| and they'd have to hit a certain percentage of low-moderate income homes, which, quite frankly, they already do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=4873)|
| 1:21:20| So it would be very easy for them to, and I'm not telling them anything they don't know, just to choose that route.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=4880)|
| 1:21:27| And that, again, is one of the reasons, I mean, that's one of the reasons we're recommending what we are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=4887)|
| 1:21:31| is they're not without alternatives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=4891)|
| 1:21:33| Again, none of us like where we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=4893)|
| 1:21:35| None of us would have negotiated this deal with those two starting points, but it's where we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=4895)|
| 1:21:40| And because of the state-enabling legislation, which hadn't passed, but if we're betting dinner, I bet does,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=4900)|
| 1:21:46| I think that impacts our decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=4906)|
| 1:21:48| So I think, I'm not sure, I have no idea who was next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=4908)|
| 1:21:52| Ms. Roddy, and then I'll come to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=4912)|
| 1:21:54| Okay, Mr. Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=4914)|
| 1:21:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=4915)|
| 1:21:56| Mr. Boccucci, now the expensive pieces of equipment that you have to locate in areas that are contiguous to where you build out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=4916)|
| 1:22:07| are those called the nodes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=4927)|
| 1:22:09| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=4929)|
| 1:22:10| The initial build, we built a fiber-to-the-curb technology in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=4930)|
| 1:22:15| That technology in the vendor no longer provides that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=4935)|
| 1:22:18| so we had to spend capital to recreate a model, which is a 860, I believe, HFC plant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=4938)|
| 1:22:29| And they're quite expensive, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=4949)|
| 1:22:32| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=4952)|
| 1:22:33| I mean, is it $300,000, $400,000 for one pod or node?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=4953)|
| 1:22:38| The way the network is designed on an HFC network, what you have is a hub,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=4958)|
| 1:22:45| and a hub has the ability to serve 20,000 homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=4965)|
| 1:22:53| Within that hub, you'll have the telephone equipment and the Internet equipment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=4973)|
| 1:22:59| The actual video equipment is provided out of the office and provided for the entire market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=4979)|
| 1:23:05| So you're looking at probably approximately in excess of a million dollars as you continue to create hubs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=4985)|
| 1:23:13| And then from the hubs, you build into what we call a fiber node.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=4993)|
| 1:23:16| And a node can be on a pedestal on the ground or it could be on a pole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=4996)|
| 1:23:22| And then you get to the distribution network, which is coaxed actually to the home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=5002)|
| 1:23:28| Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=5008)|
| 1:23:30| Now, Ms. Roddy, and then I'll come back to the Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=5010)|
| 1:23:33| Mr. Vocucci, several council members have referenced their meeting with you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=5013)|
| 1:23:38| and with your boss, Mr. Johnson, from West Point, Georgia.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=5018)|
| 1:23:42| With all due respect, I was very frank with you and with Mr. Johnson when we met,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=5022)|
| 1:23:46| that the last time you were here in front of us, the meeting pretty much tanked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=5026)|
| 1:23:50| because you were unable to give us concrete answers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=5030)|
| 1:23:53| And I was willing to support this amended contract until a few minutes ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=5033)|
| 1:23:56| when, quite frankly, you had another tanking moment with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=5036)|
| 1:23:59| Now, the notes that I have here from Mr. Martin indicate that this amended contract| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=5039)|
| 1:24:03| requires Nology to apply the $400,000 in liquidated damages| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=5043)|
| 1:24:07| as well as an additional $300,000 plus toward build-out in 2008.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=5047)|
| 1:24:12| It is my understanding that that begins tomorrow morning if this contract is approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=5052)|
| 1:24:16| And I need to hear you say that or I cannot support this contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=5056)|
| 1:24:19| It has nothing to do with what you might have done before April 22, 2008.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=5059)|
| 1:24:23| I apologize. I was trying to make the point that we were continuing to build in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=5063)|
| 1:24:27| We will commit to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=5067)|
| 1:24:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=5069)|
| 1:24:31| Mr. Vice Mayor, do you have something else or not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=5071)|
| 1:24:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=5073)|
| 1:24:34| Seeing no more lights, we're going to move toward a vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=5074)|
| 1:24:39| We're voting on the ordinance first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=5079)|
| 1:24:43| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=5083)|
| 1:24:44| Isn't that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=5084)|
| 1:24:45| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=5085)|
| 1:24:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=5086)|
| 1:24:48| I guess we better go ahead and do a voice vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=5088)|
| 1:24:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=5093)|
| 1:24:54| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=5094)|
| 1:24:55| Hold it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=5095)|
| 1:24:56| I see some protests.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=5096)|
| 1:24:57| We'll try it with just ayes and nays.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=5097)|
| 1:25:00| All those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=5100)|
| 1:25:03| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=5103)|
| 1:25:04| All those opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=5104)|
| 1:25:05| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=5105)|
| 1:25:06| Let's go to a voice vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=5106)|
| 1:25:07| Councilman Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=5107)|
| 1:25:08| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=5108)|
| 1:25:09| Councilman Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=5109)|
| 1:25:12| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=5112)|
| 1:25:13| Vice Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=5113)|
| 1:25:15| Councilman Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=5115)|
| 1:25:16| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=5116)|
| 1:25:17| Councilman Hall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=5117)|
| 1:25:18| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=5118)|
| 1:25:19| Councilman Hultquist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=5119)|
| 1:25:24| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=5124)|
| 1:25:26| Councilman Pelo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=5126)|
| 1:25:37| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=5137)|
| 1:25:39| Councilman Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=5139)|
| 1:25:40| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=5140)|
| 1:25:41| Councilman Woodhull.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=5141)|
| 1:25:45| Motion passes five to four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=5145)|
| 1:25:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=5148)|
| 1:25:52| The resolution corresponding with that is a resolution authorizing the mayor to execute and deliver a compromise and settlement agreement with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=5152)|
| 1:25:57| Knology of Knoxville, Inc., related to liquidated damages and completion of Knology's cable system within the city limits of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=5157)|
| 1:26:04| Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=5164)|
| 1:26:07| Mr. Frost, before we have a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=5167)|
| 1:26:09| You want to have a motion first?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=5169)|
| 1:26:10| Would anybody like to move that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=5170)|
| 1:26:12| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=5172)|
| 1:26:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=5173)|
| 1:26:14| Mr. Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=5174)|
| 1:26:15| Now, Mrs. Poplin or Mr. Swanson, correct me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=5175)|
| 1:26:18| This is purely establishing a contractual relationship that addresses how this money is going to be spent, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=5178)|
| 1:26:26| And this will cover the situation in the event the state law passes and they opt in to the state franchise,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=5186)|
| 1:26:35| we still have recourse for the liquidated damages and the build-out obligations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=5195)|
| 1:26:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=5201)|
| 1:26:42| Because otherwise, under the pending legislation, your local franchise terminates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=5202)|
| 1:26:48| Now, just to be certain, I obviously didn't support what happened earlier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=5208)|
| 1:26:54| but I think this is a different situation because it creates different legal rights that protects the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=5214)|
| 1:27:03| I'm kind of surprised that some voted as they did, but be it as it may, this is a different situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=5223)|
| 1:27:11| Editorial comment noted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=5231)|
| 1:27:14| Ms. Filo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=5234)|
| 1:27:16| You know, I wasn't happy about separating the two because, frankly, in my mind,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=5236)|
| 1:27:22| my decision of how to vote had a great deal to do with the two together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=5242)|
| 1:27:29| And, you know, I just asked Vice Mayor Brown if I could be excused, and he said no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=5249)|
| 1:27:34| So I did stay and vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=5254)|
| 1:27:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=5258)|
| 1:27:39| Any other comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=5259)|
| 1:27:40| Ready to vote then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=5260)|
| 1:27:41| All those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=5261)|
| 1:27:43| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=5263)|
| 1:27:46| I heard one no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=5266)|
| 1:27:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=5268)|

| 1:28:02| I'm confused.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=5282)|
| 1:28:03| Oh, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=5283)|

| 1:28:05| I'm just lost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=5285)|

| 1:29:04| If you could just come on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=5344)|
| 1:29:05| I know you probably have something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=5345)|
| 1:29:06| but if you'd say it from the microphone because it would probably be great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=5346)|
| 1:29:09| Mr. Mayor, what I have right now, being hanging out at the council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=5349)|
| 1:29:13| is some changes and an agreement to modify the existing situation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=5353)|
| 1:29:21| and to make some changes that I've provided to Ms. O'Dell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=5361)|
| 1:29:25| I told her verbally what I was working on, and at the last, this hour,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=5365)|
| 1:29:29| this evening, this afternoon,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=5369)|
| 1:29:32| I've talked to Mr. Polk and Mr. Seymour and other developers involved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=5372)|
| 1:29:37| and we've reached at least an understanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=5377)|
| 1:29:40| And I'm very comfortable with what I have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=5380)|
| 1:29:42| I think Ms. O'Dell had a question or two with regards to maybe trying to get her| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=5382)|
| 1:29:46| counsel to look at the language and to talk about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=5386)|
| 1:29:50| But I do have actually what amounts to here one, two, three, four, five| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=5390)|
| 1:30:00| new paragraphs that are amended conditions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=5400)|
| 1:30:02| and clarified conditions to this development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=5402)|
| 1:30:05| Each council member has been given one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=5405)|
| 1:30:07| I apologize for you not getting one sooner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=5407)|
| 1:30:09| but we must respect the sanctity of sunshine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=5409)|
| 1:30:12| Ms. O'Dell has one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=5412)|
| 1:30:13| I know she may have a couple of comments about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=5413)|
| 1:30:16| I like what's been put in front of you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=5416)|

| 1:30:21| I think Mr. Seymour is here, and I invite counsel to read it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=5421)|
| 1:30:24| It has been looked at by Mr. Swanson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=5424)|
| 1:30:27| It has been looked at by the attorney for the development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=5427)|
| 1:30:31| Mr. Seymour has looked at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=5431)|
| 1:30:33| It feels good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=5433)|
| 1:30:34| There may be a couple of little word changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=5434)|
| 1:30:37| I think that Mr. Swanson has pointed out one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=5437)|
| 1:30:39| and there may be another one with regards to number 13,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=5439)|
| 1:30:43| because we're adding some language in there with regards to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=5443)|
| 1:30:46| when Eastburn Drive would be closed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=5446)|
| 1:30:49| and to make sure that we added one other condition in there on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=5449)|
| 1:30:52| So I invite counsel to look at it while Ms. O'Dell comes forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=5452)|
| 1:30:55| because I think she may have had some comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=5455)|
| 1:30:57| If counsel wanted to ask some questions about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=5457)|
| 1:31:00| Please, if you could give us your name and address once more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=5460)|
| 1:31:03| Karen O'Dell, 333 Macedonia Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=5463)|
| 1:31:06| Ms. O'Dell, can you hang on one second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=5466)|
| 1:31:09| I just have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=5469)|
| 1:31:11| I see 10 conditions in here, and we're amending conditions 11, 12, and 13,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=5471)|
| 1:31:16| and I'm confused about what we're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=5476)|
| 1:31:18| Adding those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=5478)|
| 1:31:20| These are complete additions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=5480)|
| 1:31:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=5481)|
| 1:31:22| They're brand-new conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=5482)|
| 1:31:24| Counsel, it may help and maybe help even Ms. O'Dell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=5484)|
| 1:31:26| Why don't we very quickly, Mr. Swanson,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=5486)|
| 1:31:28| a couple of words we were adding in to a couple of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=5488)|
| 1:31:31| Let's put that on the record, too, so Ms. O'Dell can hear that before she speaks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=5491)|
| 1:31:35| and tell us the paragraph and what were the words we were looking to add in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=5495)|
| 1:31:39| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=5499)|
| 1:31:40| Starting with amended condition number 8, come down to the very last line there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=5500)|
| 1:31:44| and strike the word including.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=5504)|
| 1:31:47| It really makes no sense in that sentence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=5507)|
| 1:31:49| That includes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=5509)|
| 1:31:51| Where are you at?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=5511)|
| 1:31:53| Paragraph number 8.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=5513)|
| 1:31:54| Yeah, it includes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=5514)|
| 1:31:55| I struck it out so much I can't read it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=5515)|
| 1:31:58| Strike the word includes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=5518)|
| 1:32:01| What amended condition number 8?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=5521)|
| 1:32:04| Are you with me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=5524)|
| 1:32:05| Can you read what amended condition 8 should be then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=5525)|
| 1:32:08| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=5528)|
| 1:32:09| Constructing and dedication of a cul-de-sac on the end of Eastburn Drive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=5529)|
| 1:32:13| that meets the current city standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=5533)|
| 1:32:15| Constructing a gated entrance out of the cul-de-sac.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=5535)|
| 1:32:18| This gate is to remain closed at all times| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=5538)|
| 1:32:21| and ingress and egress is limited to the residents of the senior housing project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=5541)|
| 1:32:26| Additionally, the applicant shall construct two speed bumps that vehicles entering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=5546)|
| 1:32:31| and leaving the project must cross.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=5551)|
| 1:32:35| That's number 8.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=5555)|
| 1:32:37| There is a footnote on that, Mr. Swanson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=5557)|
| 1:32:40| Yes, there is a footnote number 1 that says staff, salespersons and potential buyers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=5560)|
| 1:32:46| Yes, ingress and egress is limited to the residents of the senior housing project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=5566)|
| 1:32:52| with a footnote that includes the staff, salespersons and potential buyers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=5572)|
| 1:32:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=5577)|
| 1:32:59| Then moving to amended condition number 11.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=5579)|
| 1:33:03| There are no changes from what you were distributed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=5583)|
| 1:33:08| Same with 12.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=5588)|
| 1:33:10| With 13, there are changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=5590)|
| 1:33:13| Everybody with me on 13?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=5593)|
| 1:33:15| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=5595)|
| 1:33:16| Charles, on 12?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=5596)|
| 1:33:17| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=5597)|
| 1:33:18| Oh, the gates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=5598)|
| 1:33:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=5599)|
| 1:33:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=5600)|
| 1:33:21| Never mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=5601)|
| 1:33:22| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=5602)|
| 1:33:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=5603)|
| 1:33:24| Moving to 13, we're going to start with a new phrase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=5604)|
| 1:33:26| It's going to read, whenever the applicant sells the 101st unit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=5606)|
| 1:33:31| or three years from the date of the sale of the first dwelling unit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=5611)|
| 1:33:36| whichever occurs first,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=5616)|
| 1:33:38| Eastburn Drive shall be open to only emergency traffic, fire, police, ambulance, et cetera,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=5618)|
| 1:33:46| and to applicants, sales personnel, outside agents, potential customers and staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=5626)|
| 1:33:54| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=5634)|
| 1:33:55| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=5635)|
| 1:33:57| I'm doing this at the behest of the Vice Mayor, so if that's the way he wants to do it, that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=5637)|
| 1:34:01| She wants to ask a question, Mr. Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=5641)|
| 1:34:04| I'd like to ask a question about number 13 while we're on it, if that's all right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=5644)|
| 1:34:08| And this may have to come later in the discussion, but on first read,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=5648)|
| 1:34:12| I'm a little bit confused about how once this Eastburn Drive access is closed in general,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=5652)|
| 1:34:20| how is it open to emergency traffic and sales personnel and outside agents and potential customers and staff?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=5660)|
| 1:34:26| They would be the only ones that would have the code to use that gate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=5666)|
| 1:34:30| If a fire alarm went off and went off at the fire department, I've talked to the chief about it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=5670)|
| 1:34:34| and we have some developments that are that way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=5674)|
| 1:34:36| they would have the code and the ability, if they need to, to use that entrance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=5676)|
| 1:34:39| The same thing with rural metro ambulance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=5679)|
| 1:34:43| The clubhouse is going to be built very close to this entrance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=5683)|
| 1:34:47| so the sales personnel will be able to come in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=5687)|
| 1:34:49| But everybody else who had a key card entrance, that would be changed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=5689)|
| 1:34:53| and the only way you could get in there is if you were fire, police or ambulance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=5693)|
| 1:34:56| If a fire alarm went off and someone called rural metro, those would be the folks that would have the ability to get in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=5696)|
| 1:35:01| And I think, Chief, if I'm not mistaken,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=5701)|
| 1:35:03| there's at least one or two other developments in town that have that, and that's something that can be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=5703)|
| 1:35:08| And it's been done, I think, recently at another development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=5708)|
| 1:35:11| That's true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=5711)|
| 1:35:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=5712)|
| 1:35:13| So, I mean, two weeks ago we were talking about, at this juncture, at the 101st unit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=5713)|
| 1:35:17| closing the Eastburn Drive access altogether.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=5717)|
| 1:35:20| Now what we're looking at tonight is that it's going to remain open conditionally for certain parties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=5720)|
| 1:35:25| and I'm trying to ascertain how much use that's going to create.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=5725)|
| 1:35:29| I understand that emergency personnel, hopefully, is rather rare, but sales personnel, outside agents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=5729)|
| 1:35:35| potential customers and staff, I really can't wrap my arms around how many people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=5735)|
| 1:35:39| Well, I think they can tell you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=5739)|
| 1:35:40| I imagine they have two or three people working there at the clubhouse| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=5740)|
| 1:35:43| or anybody who wants to come by and buy or sits an appointment to see a unit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=5743)|
| 1:35:47| That's what they do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=5747)|
| 1:35:48| And that's staff of the church.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=5748)|
| 1:35:49| It's not agents of the church.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=5749)|
| 1:35:50| This only deals with the actual folks who work for the developer that will be sitting there in the office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=5750)|
| 1:35:57| trying to either show a unit or sell a unit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=5757)|
| 1:35:59| So, I'm saying, and my vision of that is that that is very minimal with regards to that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=5759)|
| 1:36:04| especially once you get to the 101st unit or three years out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=5764)|
| 1:36:08| You know, they only have a certain number of units left to be sold,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=5768)|
| 1:36:10| which will actually be up probably on the ridge side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=5770)|
| 1:36:13| And you'll see what happens next with the ridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=5773)|
| 1:36:15| This was put on the table because, actually, we, after that last council meeting, quite frankly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=5775)|
| 1:36:19| we got way away from what was left in front of council to where Eastburn was going to be open, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=5779)|
| 1:36:25| which is not acceptable to the neighbors and wasn't acceptable to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=5785)|
| 1:36:28| And we kind of got it back down to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=5788)|
| 1:36:30| And I think it's something that I think is plausible and very feasible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=5790)|
| 1:36:34| and I think still also deals with the safety issue in case there's any safety issue for the development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=5794)|
| 1:36:39| for the senior citizens that will feel, hey, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=5799)|
| 1:36:42| that's a long way for the fire department to get to me or the ambulance if church has a service down on Nashville Highway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=5802)|
| 1:36:48| or to come over Rutledge Park if there's a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=5808)|
| 1:36:50| Now you've got an emergency access there which actually provides a safety valve for the actual residents that will be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=5810)|
| 1:36:56| And also this gate would not even be utilized by the senior citizens home that's already there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=5816)|
| 1:37:01| They'll have to come out in front.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=5821)|
| 1:37:02| They won't even have access to this gate at any time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=5822)|
| 1:37:04| Thank you for the clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=5824)|
| 1:37:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=5827)|
| 1:37:08| Moving on to the last condition, which is actually new condition number 14.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=5828)|
| 1:37:14| The original plan called for three five-story mid-rise buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=5834)|
| 1:37:19| The mid-rise buildings shall be eliminated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=5839)|
| 1:37:22| The plan shall be amended to show that the units shall consist only of one to two-story multifamily dwellings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=5842)|
| 1:37:29| Insert the word only after consist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=5849)|
| 1:37:32| And also let me explain when it says one to two-story because I just explained it to the neighbors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=5852)|
| 1:37:36| and how I understand this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=5856)|
| 1:37:37| A couple of the units, while they are one-story units, may have or will have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=5857)|
| 1:37:41| and I think even the diagrams show it, have a loft, a one-bedroom loft that may be above it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=5861)|
| 1:37:46| So that would technically qualify as another story.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=5866)|
| 1:37:48| But we're not talking about a whole nother full story being built up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=5868)|
| 1:37:51| Is that my understanding, Mr. Polk?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=5871)|
| 1:37:53| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=5873)|
| 1:37:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=5874)|
| 1:37:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=5875)|
| 1:37:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=5876)|
| 1:38:01| Anything else, Mr. Vice Mayor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=5881)|
| 1:38:03| I see this as a substantial movement, you know, as really it's not everything everybody wanted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=5883)|
| 1:38:11| but it's something that everybody wants and everybody, I think, can be comfortable with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=5891)|
| 1:38:17| I'm very comfortable with it, feel very positive about it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=5897)|
| 1:38:20| and I have Ms. O'Dell here who I know wishes to speak also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=5900)|
| 1:38:23| And let me also say this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=5903)|
| 1:38:27| You know, I applaud Ms. O'Dell and the neighbors up there at Eastburn for their hard work on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=5907)|
| 1:38:31| and I applaud Mr. Polk, and I applaud all the developers involved for, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=5911)|
| 1:38:36| there have been numerous meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=5916)|
| 1:38:37| Some were not very, didn't get much done, and others were even less than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=5917)|
| 1:38:46| But we are here today, and I think we're here with hopefully what I consider to be a win-win,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=5926)|
| 1:38:52| and especially when it deals with some very important issues like access to Eastburn| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=5932)|
| 1:38:57| and also the five-story, and I'll use you all's language.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=5937)|
| 1:39:03| I kind of go back and forth with Mr. Polk about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=5943)|
| 1:39:05| I call them towers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=5945)|
| 1:39:06| They call them, you know, many mid-rises.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=5946)|
| 1:39:08| But I do appreciate everyone's hard work here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=5948)|
| 1:39:11| This is a tough one to get to, and I appreciate everyone's hard work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=5951)|
| 1:39:15| And that's all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=5955)|
| 1:39:18| Ms. O'Dell, you sounded sick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=5958)|
| 1:39:19| Would you like to say something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=5959)|
| 1:39:21| Well, Mr. Brown, Councilman Brown came down and told me about this in between the beer board and council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=5961)|
| 1:39:28| So, you know, we have had no chance to really.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=5968)|
| 1:39:32| I don't know if I can ask this or not, but I guess I can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=5972)|
| 1:39:35| You can say no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=5975)|
| 1:39:36| But I was thinking if Mr. Seymour and Mr. Polk, Mr. Everett talked first,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=5976)|
| 1:39:44| then, you know, I'm going to be hearing this for the first time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=5984)|
| 1:39:47| So, you know, because this was something that I did not know until I actually got here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=5987)|
| 1:39:54| So is it possible that they speak first and then I speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=5994)|
| 1:39:57| I think that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=5997)|
| 1:39:58| I mean, you actually have some rebuttal time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=5998)|
| 1:40:00| I'm going to ask Council's permission to let her have her additional minutes after they speak,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=6000)|
| 1:40:03| if she so desires, if that's okay with Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=6003)|
| 1:40:06| It would require a suspension of the rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=6006)|
| 1:40:09| I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=6009)|
| 1:40:10| I move.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=6010)|
| 1:40:11| I move that the rules be suspended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=6011)|
| 1:40:12| All those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=6012)|
| 1:40:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=6013)|
| 1:40:14| Mr. Seymour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=6014)|
| 1:40:17| Do you want last week's speech or?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=6017)|
| 1:40:19| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=6019)|
| 1:40:22| You're not asking for a postponement tonight, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=6022)|
| 1:40:24| No, we're not here for a postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=6024)|
| 1:40:26| Arthur Seymour, Jr., 550 West Main Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=6026)|
| 1:40:30| I think Vice Mayor Brown adequately summarized what's been going on over the past two weeks in discussing this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=6030)|
| 1:40:41| This proposal, which I memorialized in writing, I think, what, Mark, about an hour or two ago, something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=6041)|
| 1:40:52| 4.53 p.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=6052)|
| 1:40:54| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=6054)|
| 1:40:56| Was what it came down to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=6056)|
| 1:40:59| I faxed it to Mr. Swanson and the Vice Mayor to review, and they have made some changes since then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=6059)|
| 1:41:10| My clients accept these as amended conditions, and they're two new conditions on the project as previously approved by the Metropolitan Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=6070)|
| 1:41:26| Let me also add what's not here in writing is the issue of the buffer and all that stuff is still covered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=6086)|
| 1:41:33| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=6093)|
| 1:41:34| Let me add that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=6094)|
| 1:41:35| Tell them about what.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=6095)|
| 1:41:37| The Trinity Project, which is the assisted living senior housing, there have been complaints about the landscaping around there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=6097)|
| 1:41:47| And that property is not covered by this use on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=6107)|
| 1:41:52| So the pastor, the director of the Trinity Center, and these developers are going to get together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=6112)|
| 1:42:03| and make certain that there is a landscaping buffer between the residents on Macedonia and Trinity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=6123)|
| 1:42:11| And I want to say also for counsel, for the record,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=6131)|
| 1:42:14| that was an issue that Ms. O'Dell and the neighbors had brought up as an example of what they considered past failures,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=6134)|
| 1:42:22| but not something that was key to this negotiation here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=6142)|
| 1:42:26| But we appreciate what they've offered, and if we do have this approval and this agreement, that will be added in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=6146)|
| 1:42:31| But just to make sure, and it was nice of Mr. Everett and Mr. Pope and Mr. Seymour to also put that down there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=6151)|
| 1:42:36| because the neighbors did bring that up as a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=6156)|
| 1:42:38| We've been up there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=6158)|
| 1:42:39| Everybody's probably been bothered seeing the two-foot-high, three-foot-high white fence that's on the other side of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=6159)|
| 1:42:44| And if we can get something done there in conjunction with this deal, I think all the better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=6164)|
| 1:42:49| But I don't think that can really be made a condition of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=6169)|
| 1:42:51| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=6171)|
| 1:42:52| That's just an assurance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=6172)|
| 1:42:54| Mr. Pope, Mr. Everett, and the pastor earlier have been discussing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=6174)|
| 1:43:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=6181)|
| 1:43:03| Anything else, Mr. Vice Mayor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=6183)|
| 1:43:06| I think maybe Mr. Swanson and Mr. Seymour could address the issue of how these are drafted enforceability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=6186)|
| 1:43:16| I think that's a concern to Ms. O'Dell when I just provided it to her and I spoke to her earlier today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=6196)|
| 1:43:21| One of her concerns is, okay, with this going in the record here and with this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=6201)|
| 1:43:26| what would this be included in that makes it enforceable and makes it, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=6206)|
| 1:43:30| something that you guys have to comply by, make it official so that they know that we don't have a vote here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=6210)|
| 1:43:36| and you guys go away and there's nothing put down in the right appropriate document or document| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=6216)|
| 1:43:43| or information so that it is something that you all have to comply with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=6223)|
| 1:43:46| I think you'd prefer to hear it from your counsel, Mr. Swanson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=6226)|
| 1:43:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=6229)|
| 1:43:50| From my attorney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=6230)|
| 1:43:51| The RP1 zoning district requires use on review that has a plan that goes with the development of the RP1 area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=6231)|
| 1:44:01| All of these conditions, both the conditions that were previously there as amended here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=6241)|
| 1:44:08| and the new conditions that are added here, the two new conditions that are added here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=6248)|
| 1:44:12| would all be a part of that plan and they would all be enforceable as any part of the zoning code is enforceable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=6252)|
| 1:44:19| through zoning enforcement mechanism by the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=6259)|
| 1:44:26| Does that answer your question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=6266)|
| 1:44:27| It does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=6267)|
| 1:44:28| I understand that, I guess, from a legal point of view,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=6268)|
| 1:44:31| make sure everybody here understands that if we can put that in layman's terms, what that actually means| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=6271)|
| 1:44:37| so Ms. O'Dell understands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=6277)|
| 1:44:39| When it is made a part of that plan and enforceable, you just said by the city, what does that mean exactly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=6279)|
| 1:44:44| What that really means is that it's not up to the neighborhood to have to enforce these conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=6284)|
| 1:44:51| Typically, though, as with all zoning across the city, you get enforcement from our zoning folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=6291)|
| 1:44:58| because there are too few of them and too many issues to deal with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=6298)|
| 1:45:02| You typically get response by means of a complaint to the codes enforcement office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=6302)|
| 1:45:08| If somebody is doing something that's inconsistent with any of this plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=6308)|
| 1:45:13| then they would need to report that to the codes enforcement office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=6313)|
| 1:45:16| The codes enforcement office would then review the plan, go out and take a look at what's happening on the ground.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=6316)|
| 1:45:22| If it's inconsistent with the plan, they would issue a cease and desist order, a stop order,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=6322)|
| 1:45:28| requiring them to come into compliance with the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=6328)|
| 1:45:31| If they fail to do that, there's a whole enforcement mechanism that can be followed by the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=6331)|
| 1:45:37| including issuing citations, including ultimately going to court and getting mandatory injunctions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=6337)|
| 1:45:42| if necessary, to enforce the zoning code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=6342)|
| 1:45:45| That would be the responsibility of the city rather than the responsibility of the neighborhood itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=6345)|
| 1:45:50| I want the neighborhood to hear that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=6350)|
| 1:45:52| If they had a complaint or saw something they didn't think was on point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=6352)|
| 1:45:56| they don't have to go out and get their own attorney and do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=6356)|
| 1:46:00| The city brings forth its resources to make sure that everything is in compliance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=6360)|
| 1:46:08| Councilman Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=6368)|
| 1:46:09| I guess this is for Mr. Seymour and Mr. Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=6369)|
| 1:46:12| On the five amended conditions, the one on number eight is something that I think we'd all agree to before the speed bumps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=6372)|
| 1:46:22| This puts that in the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=6382)|
| 1:46:25| Number 11, I actually thought number 11 was already in there, that there was a third access that they had to put in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=6385)|
| 1:46:30| but apparently it's not, so I'm glad you caught that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=6390)|
| 1:46:32| No, that was already in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=6392)|
| 1:46:33| I just amended by adding the underlying part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=6393)|
| 1:46:36| I don't see condition 11 on what I've got, so that's kind of interesting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=6396)|
| 1:46:41| And 12 is this thing that the gate's going to be closed at Eastburn,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=6401)|
| 1:46:46| and on the back entrance it's only going to be open on the front entrance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=6406)|
| 1:46:49| And that's what this one says, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=6409)|
| 1:46:51| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=6411)|
| 1:46:52| And then on 13, this idea of when Eastburn's closed, that's something we'd agreed with two weeks ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=6412)|
| 1:46:59| and now this makes it real concrete.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=6419)|
| 1:47:01| What's going to happen is at some point, and it's at the sale of the 101st unit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=6421)|
| 1:47:06| or three years from the date of the sale of the first unit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=6426)|
| 1:47:10| Whichever comes first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=6430)|
| 1:47:11| Whichever comes first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=6431)|
| 1:47:12| The code is going to be changed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=6432)|
| 1:47:14| and the only people that have the code for the gate on Eastburn are going to be emergency personnel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=6434)|
| 1:47:21| and people who work for the condominium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=6441)|
| 1:47:25| Correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=6445)|
| 1:47:26| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=6446)|
| 1:47:27| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=6447)|
| 1:47:28| And then the last one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=6448)|
| 1:47:29| And perhaps outside salesmen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=6449)|
| 1:47:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=6452)|
| 1:47:33| Realtors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=6453)|
| 1:47:34| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=6454)|
| 1:47:35| And then two weeks ago we talked about having three-story buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=6455)|
| 1:47:41| We've cut that down to two stories now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=6461)|
| 1:47:44| Most of them will be one story.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=6464)|
| 1:47:46| One.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=6466)|
| 1:47:47| With one to two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=6467)|
| 1:47:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=6468)|
| 1:47:49| I might explain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=6469)|
| 1:47:51| You mentioned there were only ten conditions in your packet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=6471)|
| 1:47:54| That was what staff originally had in their recommendation to the MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=6474)|
| 1:48:00| MPC added two additional conditions, 11 and 12.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=6480)|
| 1:48:05| And I was just cleaning up the language a little on those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=6485)|
| 1:48:11| It was off to a stand effect, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=6491)|
| 1:48:13| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=6493)|
| 1:48:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=6496)|
| 1:48:18| Mr. Seymour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=6498)|
| 1:48:19| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=6499)|
| 1:48:20| With the change that only allows up to two-story, one to two-story buildings on the site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=6500)|
| 1:48:27| including the top of the hill, would that mean that it no longer requires removal of that hilltop,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=6507)|
| 1:48:36| as was proposed before?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=6516)|
| 1:48:39| When you have smaller footprint buildings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=6519)|
| 1:48:42| can they not conform to the existing terrain more than what was proposed before?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=6522)|
| 1:48:48| I'm relaying what Mr. Everett said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=6528)|
| 1:48:51| He said it would require less than the previous plan, but there still will be dirt transfer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=6531)|
| 1:49:02| You're going to balance the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=6542)|
| 1:49:04| You aren't going to take anything off or bring it on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=6544)|
| 1:49:06| But there still will be some.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=6546)|
| 1:49:08| But the footprint of the buildings, as changed by condition 14,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=6548)|
| 1:49:15| will be less than what the five-story buildings had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=6555)|
| 1:49:19| I would think the parking, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=6559)|
| 1:49:21| I mean, it's the combination of buildings and parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=6561)|
| 1:49:24| It's obviously going to reduce the number of units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=6564)|
| 1:49:27| We do not know how much that will be yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=6567)|
| 1:49:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=6570)|
| 1:49:32| Can you explain to me why it's critical for access?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=6572)|
| 1:49:39| Let me find that footnote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=6579)|
| 1:49:42| For access for sales staff, et cetera, sales staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=6582)|
| 1:49:47| salesperson and potential buyers to use Eastburn and how that would work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=6587)|
| 1:49:52| after you explain why it's important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=6592)|
| 1:49:54| Well, one, the clubhouse will be right at that entrance, and that will be the sales office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=6594)|
| 1:50:02| And it's for convenience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=6602)|
| 1:50:04| I do not anticipate in discussing with Mr. Everett that all people will be coming in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=6604)|
| 1:50:11| As a matter of fact, we think Asheville Highway will be the primary entrance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=6611)|
| 1:50:16| but we did want to have that option for salespersons as we go forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=6616)|
| 1:50:22| because the clubhouse, which will be the sales house,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=6622)|
| 1:50:25| sales office for the time being will be located right at that entrance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=6625)|
| 1:50:29| Are you saying that it couldn't work, though, with just the Asheville Highway entrance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=6629)|
| 1:50:34| as far as potential buyers coming and going that way?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=6634)|
| 1:50:39| Well, the church is a Chill Highway Hills is a dynamic growing church.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=6639)|
| 1:50:45| Right now we know on Sundays and Wednesday nights they're full.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=6645)|
| 1:50:49| Their school is expanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=6649)|
| 1:50:51| Their other programs are expanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=6651)|
| 1:50:54| Mr. Everett, Mr. Pope just wanted this option to bring people in that way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=6654)|
| 1:51:02| so as not to conflict with church traffic at peak hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=6662)|
| 1:51:08| Okay, that's all the questions I have for the moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=6668)|
| 1:51:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=6670)|
| 1:51:11| Other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=6671)|
| 1:51:12| Ms. O'Dell, would you like to come back up and say something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=6672)|
| 1:51:15| I've lost you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=6675)|
| 1:51:16| I'm not sure where you are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=6676)|
| 1:51:17| Oh, there you are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=6677)|
| 1:51:18| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=6678)|
| 1:51:20| Lost you behind Mr. King.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=6680)|
| 1:51:22| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=6682)|
| 1:51:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=6683)|
| 1:51:25| If you can see these pages, you would believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=6685)|
| 1:51:28| Everything's changed since we got here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=6688)|
| 1:51:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=6690)|
| 1:51:31| But two weeks ago City Council allowed us to go out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=6691)|
| 1:51:34| They felt like we were close to a compromise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=6694)|
| 1:51:37| We had the meeting that we had planned with Mr. Seymour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=6697)|
| 1:51:43| Mr. Pope and Mr. Seymour, Mr. Everett and Mr. Brown, Councilman Brown, were on speaker phones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=6703)|
| 1:51:51| And when we talked that day, it was clear, Mr. Seymour made it clear that everything was off of the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=6711)|
| 1:51:59| And, you know, we were very surprised by that and very disappointed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=6719)|
| 1:52:03| But the last thing I said to Mr. Seymour was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=6723)|
| 1:52:06| please don't come to us on Tuesday afternoon before the council meeting with some 11th hour offer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=6726)|
| 1:52:13| because then we don't have time to talk to the people that are involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=6733)|
| 1:52:18| So imagine my surprise when we get here tonight and there's an offer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=6738)|
| 1:52:23| So all I think that I can say to that is that since we've arrived here, there is an offer on the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=6743)|
| 1:52:34| We certainly want to compromise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=6754)|
| 1:52:36| We want to work this out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=6756)|
| 1:52:38| We want this to work out for both people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=6758)|
| 1:52:41| But we need time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=6761)|
| 1:52:44| We need concrete things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=6764)|
| 1:52:46| We need the little details like you all are asking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=6766)|
| 1:52:49| You know, how many of those little, how many cards are there going to be that come in and out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=6769)|
| 1:52:54| You know, and what about closing Eastburn permanently?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=6774)|
| 1:53:00| So we need to work it out for both parties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=6780)|
| 1:53:03| But like you said last time, we don't need to scratch this out on the back of an envelope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=6783)|
| 1:53:07| It's been long in coming and we certainly want it to be the best for everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=6787)|
| 1:53:16| But the rest, only three people in this room even, well, of course everybody heard it now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=6796)|
| 1:53:20| but until then nobody even realized what the proposal was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=6800)|
| 1:53:25| We've had seven meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=6805)|
| 1:53:26| People have been there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=6806)|
| 1:53:27| They've paid on the appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=6807)|
| 1:53:31| And I just feel like that we need the time to go back and talk to these people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=6811)|
| 1:53:36| And I don't feel like we can make a snap decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=6816)|
| 1:53:40| I mean, we've been in the council meeting ever since we even knew about it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=6820)|
| 1:53:43| so we haven't had a chance to talk amongst ourselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=6823)|
| 1:53:46| And I think it would be irresponsible of us to just say okay without sitting down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=6826)|
| 1:53:54| and working with Ross and Keith and Mr. Seymour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=6834)|
| 1:53:57| So I'm sorry, but I have no choice but to ask the council to postpone this one more time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=6837)|
| 1:54:06| And I don't want to do it, and I know they don't want to do it, but.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=6846)|
| 1:54:09| Mr. Frost, do you want to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=6849)|
| 1:54:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=6851)|
| 1:54:12| This is an appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=6852)|
| 1:54:14| This isn't a rezoning that has to be done on two readings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=6854)|
| 1:54:17| This is just simply a one-shot resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=6857)|
| 1:54:21| So, unfortunately, we can't pass something tonight, then it comes back in two weeks' time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=6861)|
| 1:54:27| How many people in your group that has appealed, how many of you all are here tonight, Mrs. O'Dell?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=6867)|
| 1:54:37| Not a few, a few.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=6877)|
| 1:54:40| You know, you had said last time that everybody didn't need to come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=6880)|
| 1:54:43| You didn't say that, but Mr. Bailey said that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=6883)|
| 1:54:46| So we didn't encourage people to come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=6886)|
| 1:54:48| Are we back to a situation where maybe we should consider hitting a pause button| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=6888)|
| 1:54:54| so everybody could talk and we get to the rest of the agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=6894)|
| 1:54:57| Would that be of any benefit to see if this can hit a pause button during this meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=6897)|
| 1:55:03| so people can go out and see if we can?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=6903)|
| 1:55:05| I think the suggestion at this time is so that, Mrs. O'Dell,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=6905)|
| 1:55:07| I know there are several folks from the neighborhood who are here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=6907)|
| 1:55:09| so that you could go out and talk with them, not that you would go out and talk with Mr. Seymour, etc.,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=6909)|
| 1:55:13| but you could go talk with your group of folks and then get the clarification you needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=6913)|
| 1:55:19| I think there is a sense in which if there's a way to work it out tonight, they would like to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=6919)|
| 1:55:23| but I'm not going to speak for counsel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=6923)|
| 1:55:26| I sure don't want to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=6926)|
| 1:55:27| So, Mr. Becker, did you have something to add?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=6927)|
| 1:55:29| Well, I guess, you know, I would love to get this worked out tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=6929)|
| 1:55:32| but I also think there's a value of communication with the neighborhood that's worth pursuing at some level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=6932)|
| 1:55:41| This is a neighborhood that six months ago was not organized, and this came up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=6941)|
| 1:55:45| and I think they've done a remarkably good job of communicating,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=6945)|
| 1:55:48| and I would hate to force Mrs. O'Dell and the people that are here into making the decision for everybody,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=6948)|
| 1:55:55| and I know that's a problem, and I think it's partly a problem| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=6955)|
| 1:56:00| because, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=6960)|
| 1:56:02| If we had known about this Friday, if we had even known about it yesterday or even this morning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=6962)|
| 1:56:07| but, you know, I didn't even find out about it until we got here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=6967)|
| 1:56:12| Mr. Holquist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=6972)|
| 1:56:15| I think from what I'm hearing from Counselor Becker is kind of where I'm at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=6975)|
| 1:56:19| I'm thinking about all the neighborhoods in the district that I represent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=6979)|
| 1:56:23| and how I try to work with them and all that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=6983)|
| 1:56:26| and what I would think they would expect of me and expect of all of Counsel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=6986)|
| 1:56:31| or hope for Counsel in terms of how Counsel would respond to a situation like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=6991)|
| 1:56:38| And unless there's a life-and-death situation that says it has to be decided tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=6998)|
| 1:56:46| or a very serious reason justifying a decision tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=7006)|
| 1:56:51| I could see the fair and appropriate thing being to postpone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=7011)|
| 1:56:56| and allow them to respond to this offer or this proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=7016)|
| 1:57:01| Mr. Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=7021)|
| 1:57:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=7024)|
| 1:57:05| What I was just going to say is the written, Mrs. O'Dell is correct,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=7025)|
| 1:57:09| the written part of the documents she got this evening,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=7029)|
| 1:57:13| what we have here is part of two proposals that were floated around earlier during the day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=7033)|
| 1:57:17| And we did talk over the phone and I did tell you the two proposals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=7037)|
| 1:57:20| and the one that I was favoring and trying to get them to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=7040)|
| 1:57:23| and the counter one that they had put on the table that I did not think was acceptable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=7043)|
| 1:57:26| So while they have just gotten the written part of it, I did communicate earlier to that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=7046)|
| 1:57:31| and wanted everybody to think that with Mrs. O'Dell and say, hey, here's the options| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=7051)|
| 1:57:34| and here's the one that I feel very strongly about and I think it's a great compromise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=7054)|
| 1:57:38| and I'm going to support and put forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=7058)|
| 1:57:40| So I want to make sure everybody understood that that was put out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=7060)|
| 1:57:44| I do think that this has been very tedious and tenuous discussions patching this thing together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=7064)|
| 1:57:52| And there's some substantial, you know, movement here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=7072)|
| 1:57:56| And I would hope or hate to lose that, you know, in this situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=7076)|
| 1:58:01| I feel, and I told Mrs. O'Dell earlier that when she said she may want to ask for some more time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=7081)|
| 1:58:06| I said that's good if that's how you feel you should do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=7086)|
| 1:58:08| But I also want to tell you, you know, I think we've got a good agreement here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=7088)|
| 1:58:11| and I feel very good about it and want to put proper that for the council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=7091)|
| 1:58:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=7096)|
| 1:58:17| Ms. Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=7097)|
| 1:58:20| I guess I want to express to the folks in the neighborhood that I share concern about postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=7100)|
| 1:58:26| I think what we have tonight is a very good middle ground.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=7106)|
| 1:58:30| And I guess I'd like to hear from Mr. Seymour on the record that he| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=7110)|
| 1:58:34| and his team are committed to this agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=7114)|
| 1:58:39| It's the details that we're concerned about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=7119)|
| 1:58:42| You know, it's those little things like you all ask about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=7122)|
| 1:58:46| Mr. Seymour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=7126)|
| 1:58:49| Basically, Vice Mayor Brown, and I don't want to give away too much of the discussion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=7129)|
| 1:58:56| we've been discussing this obviously since the last council meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=7136)|
| 1:58:59| but he's leaned on us to do everything that's in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=7139)|
| 1:59:03| I have, especially with the last two additional conditions, and we have agreed to accept them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=7143)|
| 1:59:08| We've got four partners here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=7148)|
| 1:59:11| I would hate to see it fly apart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=7151)|
| 1:59:13| I leaned on them quite heavily with assistance from the Vice Mayor today to get them to accept these,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=7153)|
| 1:59:23| which were basically everybody's demands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=7163)|
| 1:59:27| There are competing interests in the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=7167)|
| 1:59:31| Mrs. O'Dell's group seemed to be primarily concerned about Eastman Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=7171)|
| 1:59:37| There were other people who were concerned about the height of the buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=7177)|
| 1:59:42| And he told us this was what it would take for him to support this, and we finally said okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=7182)|
| 1:59:53| He did quite a bit of arm twisting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=7193)|
| 1:59:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=7195)|
| 1:59:56| I know that feeling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=7196)|
| 1:59:58| Mr. Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=7198)|
| 2:00:01| Mr. Seymour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=7201)|
| 2:00:03| Ms. Roddy said, can you guarantee that you're going to hold on this agreement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=7203)|
| 2:00:08| And I think the answer we got was no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=7208)|
| 2:00:11| Did I hear you correctly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=7211)|
| 2:00:12| I would just hate to have two weeks and then somebody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=7212)|
| 2:00:15| The problem you run into is we understood these were the demands, basically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=7215)|
| 2:00:29| Everybody got together today, and I will confess I leaned on some people in the course of discussions, and they accepted it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=7229)|
| 2:00:37| If you postpone this, there's certainly a possibility everybody will say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=7237)|
| 2:00:42| Mrs. O'Dell will say, I want a comma here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=7242)|
| 2:00:45| One of my partners or one of the partners will say, no, I want a change and a comma here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=7245)|
| 2:00:54| And then you end up starting all over again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=7254)|
| 2:00:57| It's a fact of life that agreements, from very small agreements to very big business agreements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=7257)|
| 2:01:05| to settlement of lawsuits, and as lawyers we deal with it all the time, do not get settled until the last minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=7265)|
| 2:01:12| People say, why, as a lawyer, Mr. Frost knows this, Vice Mayor Brown knows this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=7272)|
| 2:01:18| why do you all settle cases on the courthouse steps?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=7278)|
| 2:01:21| The case has been filed three years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=7281)|
| 2:01:24| It's the nature, it's human nature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=7284)|
| 2:01:28| Dr. Johnson, many years ago, said that nothing quite focuses a man like the knowledge that one will be hung in a fortnight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=7288)|
| 2:01:38| And people really start focusing on agreements, lawsuits, controversies, as you get up right to the edge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=7298)|
| 2:01:49| I think two weeks is potentially destructive of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=7309)|
| 2:01:52| I may be wrong, but I think after everything, and I won't belabor you with everything that's going on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=7312)|
| 2:02:00| but I'm sure there has not been a day in the past two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=7320)|
| 2:02:05| I think the Vice Mayor and I have talked on weekends several times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=7325)|
| 2:02:08| He was out of town and I was out of town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=7328)|
| 2:02:12| Separate places.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=7332)|
| 2:02:13| Separate places, correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=7333)|
| 2:02:16| He was in North Carolina and I was in Georgia.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=7336)|
| 2:02:19| But we've been going back and forth like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=7339)|
| 2:02:22| And I worry that if it's not approved tonight, we might be back to square one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=7342)|
| 2:02:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=7351)|
| 2:02:33| Let's see, Mr. Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=7353)|
| 2:02:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=7354)|
| 2:02:35| I was wanting to publicly thank Mark Brown for working on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=7355)|
| 2:02:39| because I'm sure this has been a yeoman's task.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=7359)|
| 2:02:41| I've been in contact with Mrs. O'Dell and people that agree with neighborhood groups, opposition to this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=7361)|
| 2:02:50| and Mr. Seymour and Mr. Pope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=7370)|
| 2:02:55| There's a saying I use, the final draft is the one you're working on when time runs out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=7375)|
| 2:03:01| I'm kind of betwixt and between where we are right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=7381)|
| 2:03:04| I think the developers have moved in a considerable fashion in a good way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=7384)|
| 2:03:14| I certainly understand Mrs. O'Dell's and the other appellant's position,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=7394)|
| 2:03:21| that they haven't had the time to look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=7401)|
| 2:03:30| I haven't been involved in the discussions like Vice Mayor has.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=7410)|
| 2:03:33| I'd like to, you know, have a better comfort level of where we're going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=7413)|
| 2:03:39| I think if we're not there, we're at a real close position where we can approve it, approve the development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=7419)|
| 2:03:48| And I just want to hear some sentiment to that regard that, you know, he thinks we're where we need to be to move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=7428)|
| 2:03:56| That's what I was trying to say earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=7436)|
| 2:03:58| I think we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=7438)|
| 2:03:59| From my vantage point, and I've made that clear to both sides,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=7439)|
| 2:04:02| I understand Mrs. O'Dell's concern about maybe wanting to go back and get a little more time to have an attorney look at the language| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=7442)|
| 2:04:09| or talk to some more of her people, as I communicated to her earlier, you know, on the phone earlier today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=7449)|
| 2:04:15| and also when I got this and handed it out to her this afternoon when she got here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=7455)|
| 2:04:20| You know, I think we're in a place, well, I'm not going to say this in case we have to reset this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=7460)|
| 2:04:26| but I was going to say I think we're in a place I wasn't sure we were going to get to, quite frankly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=7466)|
| 2:04:30| especially as it relates to the mid-rises, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=7470)|
| 2:04:34| and especially to at least getting to where Eastburn at some juncture, you know, would be closed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=7474)|
| 2:04:40| except for, you know, the realtor who I think maybe is Ms. Davis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=7480)|
| 2:04:44| and, you know, a couple of folks who are going to be working there in the clubhouse until they sell all the units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=7484)|
| 2:04:49| And then that staff is going to go away, and that little caveat down there, what staff sells for potential buyers goes away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=7489)|
| 2:04:55| You know, so then that does go away after they're through with the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=7495)|
| 2:04:59| Then you've got where it's closed, Eastburn's closed only to emergency vehicles and situations of that nature,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=7499)|
| 2:05:04| which I think is a great marketing piece for the development, but also deals with any safety issue there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=7504)|
| 2:05:10| which I feel very good about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=7510)|
| 2:05:12| I am concerned, you know, as Mr. Seymour has said, because if we put it off again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=7512)|
| 2:05:22| I am concerned that we'll get to going through some more but-ifs, what-ifs, what-about, you know, and what-about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=7522)|
| 2:05:28| and we end up nowhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=7528)|
| 2:05:30| Actually, what happened since last time in council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=7530)|
| 2:05:32| I remember Roddy asked about one of these issues and said, well, weren't we there last time a little further?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=7532)|
| 2:05:37| What happens, what Arthur alluded to a few minutes ago, we fell all apart, literally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=7537)|
| 2:05:41| And we've kind of got it back together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=7541)|
| 2:05:43| And I think we've got something here that is workable, that puts a good project on the ground,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=7543)|
| 2:05:50| and also deals with these issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=7550)|
| 2:05:51| As I said before, I spoke earlier, everybody doesn't get everything they want here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=7551)|
| 2:05:56| but I think it's enough in here that ultimately everybody will be pleased with what we end up with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=7556)|
| 2:06:02| It's still going to be a 50s and over unit that's going to be part of the deed, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=7562)|
| 2:06:06| all that sort of stuff that we've already talked about is already in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=7566)|
| 2:06:09| So Councilman Frost, yes, I do think that we have a deal here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=7569)|
| 2:06:12| We have an agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=7572)|
| 2:06:13| You know, Mr. Seymour has said on the record, Mr. Pope is here, Mr. Everett is here on the record,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=7573)|
| 2:06:19| that these will be made a part of the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=7579)|
| 2:06:21| You know, they've got things that are going to be made a part of deed restrictions, such as the 50 and over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=7581)|
| 2:06:25| So I think we've got a good plan in place, you know, that, quite frankly, and I've said this to both parties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=7585)|
| 2:06:31| I am ultimately concerned with, you know, ending up in litigation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=7591)|
| 2:06:35| and letting a judge somehow cobble together something that's like this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=7595)|
| 2:06:39| or much different than this or puts us in a position where one side is totally happy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=7599)|
| 2:06:44| and the other side is totally, you know, not satisfied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=7604)|
| 2:06:47| So that was my goal here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=7607)|
| 2:06:49| I'm probably, you know, instead of upsetting half the room, upset all the room,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=7609)|
| 2:06:53| but that's what you have to do when you're elected official sometime,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=7613)|
| 2:06:55| and you step out there and say, I'll stand on the yellow line in the middle of the road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=7615)|
| 2:06:59| and hope traffic doesn't hit me going both ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=7619)|
| 2:07:01| And so that's where I am, and I do think that we have a good offer here, a good situation here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=7621)|
| 2:07:07| That's how I fell on an earlier item tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=7627)|
| 2:07:09| Mr. Olkos.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=7629)|
| 2:07:12| Well, I think what I'm hearing is that there is a chance of coming to some reasonable resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=7632)|
| 2:07:18| using the hard work of Councilman Brown that we have in front of us tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=7638)|
| 2:07:25| which means we have to get our questions answered tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=7645)|
| 2:07:29| If we're not going to have a postponement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=7649)|
| 2:07:32| and an opportunity for the parties to get together subsequently,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=7652)|
| 2:07:37| then I think we all have to try to do the best we can to get our questions answered tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=7657)|
| 2:07:42| And going back to I think it was Councilman Frost suggested perhaps doing what we did last time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=7662)|
| 2:07:48| just for the folks in the neighborhood if they need to huddle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=7668)|
| 2:07:53| Should we give them time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=7673)|
| 2:07:54| Do they want to do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=7674)|
| 2:07:56| And I have one question right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=7676)|
| 2:07:59| Councilman Brown, you may be able to answer this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=7679)|
| 2:08:02| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=7682)|
| 2:08:03| Or maybe Mr. Seymour or someone else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=7683)|
| 2:08:08| Condition 8 and Condition 13 I believe is where the language staff, salesperson,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=7688)|
| 2:08:16| and potential buyers comes in on both of those conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=7696)|
| 2:08:20| And it's pretty easy to conceive how it would work if you have pass cards for staff and salespeople.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=7700)|
| 2:08:30| But I'm not sure I understand how it would work with potential buyers if they pull up to the gate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=7710)|
| 2:08:37| That's a good point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=7717)|
| 2:08:38| Are they going to mail out pass cards to everybody?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=7718)|
| 2:08:41| I would say let's get their commitment right now about that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=7721)|
| 2:08:44| because my understanding of how that would work is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=7724)|
| 2:08:47| let's say a salesperson or staff has a person who's coming by to look at a facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=7727)|
| 2:08:53| They make that appointment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=7733)|
| 2:08:54| They maybe meet the staff person at the gate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=7734)|
| 2:08:56| They let them in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=7736)|
| 2:08:57| Or they're coming with, say, Ms. Davis is one of the realtors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=7737)|
| 2:09:00| Let's say she's bringing somebody in to look at a unit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=7740)|
| 2:09:03| She's in her car there and there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=7743)|
| 2:09:04| She says, follow me up to the gate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=7744)|
| 2:09:06| She goes in and they come in after.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=7746)|
| 2:09:08| So, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=7748)|
| 2:09:09| And I want to make sure I hear those guys said, I don't see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=7749)|
| 2:09:11| and this does not envision potential buyers or cards flying all over the place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=7751)|
| 2:09:15| This doesn't even have cards in the church.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=7755)|
| 2:09:17| The church doesn't even have access to this under this agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=7757)|
| 2:09:20| So, they wouldn't even have cards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=7760)|
| 2:09:21| So, I don't envision that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=7761)|
| 2:09:22| And Arthur, Ross, Keith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=7762)|
| 2:09:25| Could the language be changed to say potential buyers accompanied by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=7765)|
| 2:09:33| or escorted by staff?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=7773)|
| 2:09:37| I don't have a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=7777)|
| 2:09:38| We're doing what we talked about would happen in over two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=7778)|
| 2:09:40| But I don't have a problem with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=7780)|
| 2:09:41| And I think that clears it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=7781)|
| 2:09:42| Because that's my understanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=7782)|
| 2:09:43| That's what I would like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=7783)|
| 2:09:44| I would defer Ms. Davis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=7784)|
| 2:09:48| But I think if we start changing the language at all, this is going to fly apart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=7788)|
| 2:09:54| Are you saying you have a problem of putting in language just like we described?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=7794)|
| 2:10:00| I'm going to let Ms. Davis describe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=7800)|
| 2:10:02| Yeah, I'd like to hear from her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=7802)|
| 2:10:06| Sharon Davis, 4014 Hoston Hills Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=7806)|
| 2:10:09| How are you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=7809)|
| 2:10:11| Most of you know me as a neighborhood advocate and a realtor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=7811)|
| 2:10:16| And before I take your question, Joe, I'd like to say to the neighbors all of them here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=7816)|
| 2:10:22| when I introduced this project, I did not intentionally make any fears in their minds or in their hearts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=7822)|
| 2:10:32| I did not mean to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=7832)|
| 2:10:34| That was not my intentions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=7834)|
| 2:10:36| But I do think that some of the fears are unfounded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=7836)|
| 2:10:39| And I appreciate you tonight considering this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=7839)|
| 2:10:43| And I ask you not to tie the hands of these developers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=7843)|
| 2:10:48| Mr. Frost, you said in your business you have a saying that the final draft is the one that you're working on at the moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=7848)|
| 2:10:56| Well, as a realtor, we have a saying that says, close the deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=7856)|
| 2:11:01| Because time is not your friend when you have so much negotiations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=7861)|
| 2:11:05| You've got to compromise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=7865)|
| 2:11:07| You get your buyer and you get your seller together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=7867)|
| 2:11:09| So that's what I'm asking you to do tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=7869)|
| 2:11:11| As far as the question of bringing a buyer onto the development, what is that question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=7871)|
| 2:11:20| The question is, staff and salespeople obviously would have a pass card to get through the gate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=7880)|
| 2:11:27| And how would the buyer get through the gate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=7887)|
| 2:11:31| Any buyer, let's say somebody's interested, what do they do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=7891)|
| 2:11:34| Do they call you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=7894)|
| 2:11:36| Do they call sales staff, whoever that may be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=7896)|
| 2:11:39| and arrange a time and they meet them at the gate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=7899)|
| 2:11:44| How does that work?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=7904)|
| 2:11:45| That's the way I do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=7905)|
| 2:11:46| And preferably these days I prequalify the buyer before I ever bring them to whatever I'm showing, whatever property I'm showing them to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=7906)|
| 2:11:53| So it's not just like I call up and say, okay, somebody meet me down in the corner here at this tree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=7913)|
| 2:11:59| I know who I'm talking to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=7919)|
| 2:12:01| I've had conversations with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=7921)|
| 2:12:02| I've called them back at their house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=7922)|
| 2:12:04| Half the time I look them up and see if they're from Knoxville to see who it is that I'm working with and to prequalify that buyer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=7924)|
| 2:12:12| So they would be, yes, to answer your question, Joe, that would be, they would have an appointment at a certain time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=7932)|
| 2:12:18| It would always be accompanied by you or some sales staff in order to look?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=7938)|
| 2:12:23| They wouldn't have a card.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=7943)|
| 2:12:25| I mean, they could look over the gate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=7945)|
| 2:12:27| Well, that's the question is how they would get in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=7947)|
| 2:12:29| They would get in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=7949)|
| 2:12:31| Yes, I would need to bring them in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=7951)|
| 2:12:33| I'm pretty good, but I can't hardly sell them from the outside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=7953)|
| 2:12:37| I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=7957)|
| 2:12:38| So you would have no problem with changing this language to say staff, salesperson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=7958)|
| 2:12:43| I can't change any language.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=7963)|
| 2:12:44| You would have no problem with language that said staff, salesperson or potential buyers when accompanied by staff or salespeople,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=7964)|
| 2:12:55| however you want to say that, salespersons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=7975)|
| 2:12:58| You'd have no problem with that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=7978)|
| 2:13:00| I always have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=7980)|
| 2:13:01| If I'm coming, a buyer cannot get in without me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=7981)|
| 2:13:04| So what I'm hearing is you would have no problem with that language because that's exactly what you're describing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=7984)|
| 2:13:10| And I'll let the attorney do their language.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=7990)|
| 2:13:14| I don't hear any objection to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=7994)|
| 2:13:16| I can't send a buyer without me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=7996)|
| 2:13:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=7999)|
| 2:13:20| So I think you've answered my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=8000)|
| 2:13:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=8002)|
| 2:13:23| That's very helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=8003)|
| 2:13:24| From time to time, if I had an open house, you know, and I do that quite often, especially in a new development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=8004)|
| 2:13:32| then that buyer would come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=8012)|
| 2:13:35| I would open the gate for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=8015)|
| 2:13:37| That would need to be addressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=8017)|
| 2:13:41| They would not get a card?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=8021)|
| 2:13:43| They would not get a card, no, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=8023)|
| 2:13:45| So you still have to be at the gate letting somebody in or a staff person?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=8025)|
| 2:13:48| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=8028)|
| 2:13:49| So that wouldn't be an appointment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=8029)|
| 2:13:51| It would be an open house for a couple hours on a designated time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=8031)|
| 2:13:56| But you or some sales staff would still have to let them in the gate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=8036)|
| 2:14:00| That's fine with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=8040)|
| 2:14:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=8041)|
| 2:14:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=8042)|
| 2:14:03| I always open the doors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=8043)|
| 2:14:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=8045)|
| 2:14:06| Any other comment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=8046)|
| 2:14:07| If not, we're going to move toward the vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=8047)|
| 2:14:10| Mayor, can I just ask one question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=8050)|
| 2:14:12| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=8052)|
| 2:14:13| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=8053)|
| 2:14:14| That's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=8054)|
| 2:14:15| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=8055)|
| 2:14:16| I got thrown into the deep end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=8056)|
| 2:14:17| Please understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=8057)|
| 2:14:18| We understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=8058)|
| 2:14:19| We understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=8059)|
| 2:14:20| I'm going to say his name again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=8060)|
| 2:14:21| I'm kidding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=8061)|
| 2:14:22| I'm kidding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=8062)|
| 2:14:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=8063)|
| 2:14:24| Eric, the question that looms large in our mind, the largest, is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=8064)|
| 2:14:29| I know the words say that in three years, Eastburn will be closed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=8069)|
| 2:14:35| But I know that I have heard from, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=8075)|
| 2:14:40| from a council member today that they can come back,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=8080)|
| 2:14:45| they can appeal at that time in three years to have the road continue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=8085)|
| 2:14:50| to stay open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=8090)|
| 2:14:52| We also were told by city engineering that we needed to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=8092)|
| 2:14:56| because we came up and talked to them last week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=8096)|
| 2:14:58| that if we don't have this wordage down perfectly so that, in fact,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=8098)|
| 2:15:06| in three years from the date that they set, the road will be closed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=8106)|
| 2:15:12| that a barricade will be put across it or whatever and it will be done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=8112)|
| 2:15:17| or however.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=8117)|
| 2:15:19| But you understand what we're saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=8119)|
| 2:15:21| We realize that when they say it will be closed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=8121)|
| 2:15:25| we're afraid they're thinking if they can't appeal it and keep it open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=8125)|
| 2:15:30| If we know in a certain amount of time that Eastburn will be closed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=8130)|
| 2:15:36| and closed permanently,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=8136)|
| 2:15:39| except to these emergency vehicles and to the fire department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=8139)|
| 2:15:43| and to things like that, that's very important to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=8143)|
| 2:15:46| And I know it sounds like that, but that's what I'm talking about, the details.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=8146)|
| 2:15:50| We need a lawyer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=8150)|
| 2:15:52| You know, I talked to a lawyer this afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=8152)|
| 2:15:54| Again, he said, you have to have these details down specifically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=8154)|
| 2:15:59| That's my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=8159)|
| 2:16:00| That's the neighborhood's question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=8160)|
| 2:16:02| Would anybody like to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=8162)|
| 2:16:04| Let me say, and she may be referring to me as a council member,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=8164)|
| 2:16:07| I understand that they would have the right to come back and do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=8167)|
| 2:16:10| When we had our discussions, I tried to close that door that way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=8170)|
| 2:16:14| but in talking to Mr. Swanson to help me out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=8174)|
| 2:16:17| I don't know that we can require or limit that right that they would have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=8177)|
| 2:16:23| if they wanted to come back in four years or five years and say, hey,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=8183)|
| 2:16:26| we'd like to go for a use-on-review just like they did now and go to MPC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=8186)|
| 2:16:30| file for a use-on-review and have the road looked at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=8190)|
| 2:16:34| They did, and I didn't have this said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=8194)|
| 2:16:36| they did agree that they would, and you had asked me about this earlier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=8196)|
| 2:16:39| Ms. O'Dell, that they would, not only if they did that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=8199)|
| 2:16:42| you'd have to go through the process of MPC and possibly even back to council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=8202)|
| 2:16:47| but they would also get your address,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=8207)|
| 2:16:49| and you said you wanted two other people's addresses tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=8209)|
| 2:16:53| and make sure that they send you all something in writing which says if they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=8213)|
| 2:16:56| plan on trying to exercise that right somewhere down the line after this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=8216)|
| 2:17:00| three years, and they've agreed to do that also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=8220)|
| 2:17:03| But from talking to Mr. Swanson earlier, and my understanding is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=8223)|
| 2:17:07| I understand what you're asking, but I don't know if we can take that right away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=8227)|
| 2:17:11| And they haven't agreed to give that right away, but they have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=8231)|
| 2:17:14| They may come and try and do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=8234)|
| 2:17:15| They may not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=8235)|
| 2:17:16| But if they do, they have to go back to MPC, under use-on-review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=8236)|
| 2:17:19| It can still come before council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=8239)|
| 2:17:21| and they would notify you guys even before they send it in to say, hey,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=8241)|
| 2:17:25| you know, the traffic is such, guys,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=8245)|
| 2:17:27| we want to have MPC and council look at this issue again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=8247)|
| 2:17:30| and we'll come back under those circumstances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=8250)|
| 2:17:33| Councilman Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=8253)|
| 2:17:34| Well, I guess this is maybe just to clarify with Mr. Swanson and Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=8254)|
| 2:17:38| Donaldson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=8258)|
| 2:17:39| This is a plan of some kind that we're approving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=8259)|
| 2:17:44| Now, this is a – was he right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=8264)|
| 2:17:48| Is that – which part?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=8268)|
| 2:17:52| Just everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=8272)|
| 2:17:55| That it would be a use-on-review to change the conditions that we're setting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=8275)|
| 2:18:01| tonight and that MPC has set.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=8281)|
| 2:18:03| Is that the process on changing any of these?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=8283)|
| 2:18:05| I mean, I'm a little confused of exactly how, when we set these conditions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=8285)|
| 2:18:10| anybody could be allowed to change them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=8290)|
| 2:18:12| I mean, is it a use-on-review change or what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=8292)|
| 2:18:15| Just like the zoning that you have on your property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=8295)|
| 2:18:18| It can be changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=8298)|
| 2:18:20| And you don't have to be, as a property owner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=8300)|
| 2:18:22| you don't have to be the person who applies to make that change,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=8302)|
| 2:18:25| but you know from sitting on council that it's very unlikely that you're going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=8305)|
| 2:18:30| change some property owner's zoning unless you have some really,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=8310)|
| 2:18:33| really good reason to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=8313)|
| 2:18:35| So, you know, there are rights out there with regard to the utilization of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=8315)|
| 2:18:39| property that people are always going to have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=8319)|
| 2:18:42| And I think it would be, number one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=8322)|
| 2:18:45| I'm not sure that you legally could restrict those rights in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=8325)|
| 2:18:49| And, number two, I think it would be a very bad idea to, even if you could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=8329)|
| 2:18:53| And I guess I'm okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=8333)|
| 2:18:56| And I want to make sure I'm not misstating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=8336)|
| 2:18:59| If we had this down to condition about that closure, Mr. Donaldson,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=8339)|
| 2:19:02| and it's in there and it's in the plan and it's all set there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=8342)|
| 2:19:05| if they decided four years down the line, listen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=8345)|
| 2:19:08| we'd like to go back to MPC to get this road opened up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=8348)|
| 2:19:12| They put Ms. O'Dell on notice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=8352)|
| 2:19:14| When they come to you guys, wouldn't they come to you guys| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=8354)|
| 2:19:16| and there would be a request for another use on review to have that changed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=8356)|
| 2:19:20| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=8360)|
| 2:19:21| The use on review is the process by which we hear a case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=8361)|
| 2:19:26| The product of that process is a development plan that's approved by the planning commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=8366)|
| 2:19:31| That development plan is the site plan plus all of the conditions that are attached.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=8371)|
| 2:19:36| Anybody can apply to have an amendment to that plan once it's approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=8376)|
| 2:19:43| That goes through the use on review process again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=8383)|
| 2:19:46| and the end result could be approval or disapproval of the amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=8386)|
| 2:19:50| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=8390)|
| 2:19:51| And if the party that didn't agree with the decision at MPC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=8391)|
| 2:19:56| they could still come back here to counsel?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=8396)|
| 2:19:59| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=8399)|
| 2:20:00| And by initiating the use on review process, you initiate the public notice requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=8400)|
| 2:20:06| We mail a notice, we post the property, and we publish in the paper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=8406)|
| 2:20:10| So there's ample notice to the immediate public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=8410)|
| 2:20:17| Anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=8417)|
| 2:20:18| Councilman Hawkins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=8418)|
| 2:20:22| Going back to the footnote on number eight and then the language in number 13,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=8422)|
| 2:20:32| based on Ms. Davis' answers, I think, good answers to a reasonable question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=8432)|
| 2:20:41| it doesn't sound like there's any problem with changing that language slightly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=8441)|
| 2:20:45| And I asked Mr. Swanson, and it's very simple.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=8445)|
| 2:20:48| Mr. Swanson, could you read the suggested change?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=8448)|
| 2:20:53| I think the suggested change you wanted in the footnote on condition number eight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=8453)|
| 2:20:58| you wanted the footnote to read staff, salespersons,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=8458)|
| 2:21:03| and potential buyers accompanied by staff or salespersons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=8463)|
| 2:21:07| And I assume that you wanted that same language, accompanied by staff or salespersons,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=8467)|
| 2:21:12| to follow the word staff in number 13.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=8472)|
| 2:21:18| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=8478)|
| 2:21:19| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=8479)|
| 2:21:22| Councilman Brown, Vice Mayor Brown, would you accept that as a friendly amendment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=8482)|
| 2:21:26| Yes, I would, because I envision this how that would happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=8486)|
| 2:21:29| You know, they're not going to give out cards, in my understanding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=8489)|
| 2:21:31| and have, you know, put down at the local pilot, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=8491)|
| 2:21:34| a stack of cards that say come by and come in and take a look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=8494)|
| 2:21:38| I'm trying to bring some levity here, lift it up a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=8498)|
| 2:21:41| I was very intense earlier, so I'm trying to bring some levity here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=8501)|
| 2:21:45| But I don't see them handing out cards, you know, for folks to come by and wholesale,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=8505)|
| 2:21:48| come in and out of the facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=8508)|
| 2:21:50| That may satisfy some of the concerns of the people in the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=8510)|
| 2:21:54| I think that's very reasonable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=8514)|
| 2:21:55| Yeah, Mayor, I just wanted to pick up on that, too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=8515)|
| 2:21:57| the part about on 13 there at the end about applicants, sales personnel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=8517)|
| 2:22:03| outside agents, potential customers and staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=8523)|
| 2:22:06| I mean, I don't think that would even happen, really,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=8526)|
| 2:22:09| because you've got the church entrance already open, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=8529)|
| 2:22:12| And so I'm wondering why it's even in there, because just, Arthur,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=8532)|
| 2:22:16| just bear with me here on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=8536)|
| 2:22:18| You know the neighborhood just doesn't want more cars up there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=8538)|
| 2:22:21| and that just kind of sends a signal that that's the intent is to steer people up there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=8541)|
| 2:22:26| And I would think that if I'm sharing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=8546)|
| 2:22:28| I'd probably have them come over and meet me in the church around there somewhere and go on up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=8548)|
| 2:22:33| Right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=8553)|
| 2:22:34| Not necessarily, because I guess I'm not in the real estate business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=8554)|
| 2:22:40| Sharon is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=8560)|
| 2:22:41| But I would guess 90% of the time they'll come off Asheville Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=8561)|
| 2:22:45| But the sales office is up there in the clubhouse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=8565)|
| 2:22:48| And that's, she may want to, she or her associates may want to bring some people in that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=8568)|
| 2:22:57| I doubt it will occur very frequently, but they don't want to foreclose that option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=8577)|
| 2:23:04| Well, you know, I mean, I said two different things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=8584)|
| 2:23:07| One, I don't think it would really happen, because the easiest way is just to go through the church,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=8587)|
| 2:23:11| which is always open, but I'm just curious why it was put in there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=8591)|
| 2:23:14| because it kind of sends a sign that that's the way you're going to try to route people in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=8594)|
| 2:23:20| So I just think it defeats its purpose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=8600)|
| 2:23:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=8603)|
| 2:23:24| We still get our 20 minutes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=8604)|
| 2:23:26| Do we still get our 20 minutes to discuss it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=8606)|
| 2:23:31| That's up to, that will be a council's decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=8611)|
| 2:23:37| I think that, can I?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=8617)|
| 2:23:39| We'll be here for a while after, okay, I have no problem with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=8619)|
| 2:23:43| Council, just by, what Ms. O'Dell is asking is can her group take 15, 20 minutes to go in another room,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=8623)|
| 2:23:50| talk about this amongst themselves, and come back before we vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=8630)|
| 2:23:54| In case we have any more questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=8634)|
| 2:23:57| I prefer to just put it at the end of the agenda rather than putting a time clock on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=8637)|
| 2:24:00| I think it would make us more than 20 minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=8640)|
| 2:24:02| Well, the only, we won't put a time clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=8642)|
| 2:24:04| Well, the only thing is there are a lot of folks, other folks here, and I think in their interest,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=8644)|
| 2:24:10| they should be mindful of the clock and come back as quick as you can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=8650)|
| 2:24:13| We'd love to see you in the next 20 minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=8653)|
| 2:24:15| Yes, sir, we'll be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=8655)|
| 2:24:16| We will hold the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=8656)|
| 2:24:17| If you would get back here as quick as you can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=8657)|
| 2:24:19| And then I don't know if somebody wants to go with them to provide answers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=8659)|
| 2:24:23| They say no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=8663)|
| 2:24:24| We're going to then move to postpone, suspend the rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=8664)|
| 2:24:31| Gosh, I should remember this now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=8671)|
| 2:24:33| Suspend the rules, hit pause.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=8673)|
| 2:24:36| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=8676)|
| 2:24:38| And then we don't need to vote to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=8678)|
| 2:24:40| We can just, we're going to suspend the rules and come back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=8680)|
| 2:24:43| I apologize to all those who are here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=8683)|
| 2:24:44| but I do think this is the best way to get a resolution, which is what everybody wants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=8684)|
| 2:24:47| Mr. Seymour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=8687)|
| 2:24:48| I would like to recognize some of the people have other activities they have to go to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=8688)|
| 2:24:55| I think that's very well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=8695)|
| 2:24:57| There are a number of people here from Chill Highway Baptist Church who are very interested in the mission of the church| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=8697)|
| 2:25:03| and in this project in particular, and they're here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=8703)|
| 2:25:06| And let them have their day in the sunshine here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=8706)|
| 2:25:10| I think that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=8710)|
| 2:25:11| And so noted and acknowledged.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=8711)|
| 2:25:13| And we will leave it to them if they want to stay until the other folks come back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=8713)|
| 2:25:16| Your presence and your interest has been noted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=8716)|
| 2:25:18| I think we obviously would love for you to stay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=8718)|
| 2:25:22| But I think at this point in time we understand the interest that you have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=8722)|
| 2:25:26| and you can obviously handle that however you want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=8726)|
| 2:25:30| Okay, Ms. Mitchell, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=8730)|
| 2:25:32| Item B is a resolution approving a contract between the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=8732)|
| 2:25:35| and Professional Computer Software Services, Inc.,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=8735)|

| 2:26:03| Mr. Martin, is Ms. Roddy here, or are you answering questions about this contract?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=8763)|
| 2:26:07| Fortunately, Janet is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=8767)|
| 2:26:10| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=8770)|
| 2:26:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=8771)|
| 2:26:13| Ms. Roddy, I'm looking over this contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=8773)|
| 2:26:16| I just had a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=8776)|
| 2:26:17| On page 5, number 4, integrated voice response,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=8777)|
| 2:26:21| indicates that automated voice response to the public will be available,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=8781)|
| 2:26:26| but this system uses standard voices only.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=8786)|
| 2:26:29| And what I'm wondering is, what's the standard voice?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=8789)|
| 2:26:32| Is that English only?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=8792)|
| 2:26:33| Is that Southern only?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=8793)|
| 2:26:35| That's a great question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=8795)|
| 2:26:37| There are voices that you get free on the Internet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=8797)|
| 2:26:41| and we've already decided that we like other voices better,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=8801)|
| 2:26:45| and so you have to pay for those, but that's what comes with the contract,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=8805)|
| 2:26:50| but we will augment that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=8810)|
| 2:26:52| So it's the voice that speaks, not the voice that reports.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=8812)|
| 2:26:54| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=8814)|
| 2:26:55| This is a computerized voice, and we actually listen to some of those,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=8815)|
| 2:26:59| and they're called the standard voices,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=8819)|
| 2:27:01| but there's others that you can get that really sound more human,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=8821)|
