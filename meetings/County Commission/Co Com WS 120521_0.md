| 0:00:16| Salute, pledge, I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=16)|
| 0:00:23| and to the republic for which it stands, one nation under God,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=23)|

| 0:00:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=34)|
| 0:00:35| Next we have amendments to the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=35)|
| 0:00:37| And, Commissioner Broyles, I wanted to make sure that you had wanted to delay the food policy for 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=37)|
| 0:00:44| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=44)|
| 0:00:45| Yes. In light of what we're doing with budget discussion and lots of people for public forum,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=45)|
| 0:00:53| we've decided we're just going to push that back to a less hectic time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=53)|
| 0:00:58| Also, we had said that MPC is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=58)|
| 0:01:01| We want to talk with them about their budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=61)|

| 0:01:19| So I just want to see what the will of the commission is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=79)|
| 0:01:23| and maybe have a request of the mayor's office about that budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=83)|
| 0:01:28| We'll add that as a discussion item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=88)|

| 0:01:52| Before we take a vote, I need to call the roll so we can get proper notation of everyone who is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=112)|

| 0:02:17| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=137)|
| 0:02:18| Do I have a motion that we add what needs to be added and delete what needs to be deleted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=138)|
| 0:02:19| and change what needs to be changed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=139)|
| 0:02:20| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=140)|
| 0:02:21| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=141)|
| 0:02:22| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=142)|
| 0:02:23| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=143)|
| 0:02:24| Our agenda is set.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=144)|
| 0:02:25| Next is the approval of the minutes of the previous meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=145)|
| 0:02:27| Is there a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=147)|
| 0:02:28| Motion approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=148)|
| 0:02:29| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=149)|

| 0:02:32| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=152)|
| 0:02:33| It is approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=153)|
| 0:02:34| I want to give you a suggested consent agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=154)|
| 0:02:39| These items we will put on consent, but feel free to pull anything that you would like to see discussed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=159)|
| 0:02:44| First, resolutions 110 and 111.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=164)|
| 0:02:47| Both of those are numbered number four, but number 110 and 111.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=167)|
| 0:02:51| And then items number five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 50, 51, 51, 52, 52, 53, 53, 54, 55, 56, 56, 57, 57, 58, 58, 59, 59, 60, 60, 60, 61, 62, 63, 62, 63, 63, 63, 63, 63, 63, 63, 63, 63, 63, 63, 63, 63, 63, 63, 63, 63, 63, 63, 63, 63, 63, 63, 63, 63, 63, 63, 63, 63, 63, 63, 63, 63, 63, 63, 63, 63, 63| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=171)|
| 0:03:21| 31, 22, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 33, 36 Does anyone like to, would anyone like to remove?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=201)|
| 0:03:43| Could you give us a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=223)|
| 0:03:44| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=224)|
| 0:04:14| Before I call for the vote, is anyone here from the, I was looking for Dr. McIntyre and did not see him, but this is the time that if anyone has any questions about the school consent, this is when we ask those questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=254)|
| 0:04:27| Does anyone have any questions of the school consent?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=267)|
| 0:04:30| If not, do I hear a motion that we approve the consent items?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=270)|
| 0:04:34| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=274)|
| 0:04:35| All those, is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=275)|
| 0:04:37| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=277)|
| 0:04:38| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=278)|
| 0:04:39| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=279)|
| 0:04:40| Those, they are approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=280)|
| 0:04:41| So, clerk, so I want to make sure there are no questions about school consent, so we'll just bypass those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=281)|
| 0:04:47| So, first item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=287)|
| 0:04:54| The first item is listed on page five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=294)|
| 0:04:57| It's item 23, resolution 411.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=297)|
| 0:05:01| It's approving a settlement and release agreement between Knox County, Bud Cullum, and TTC Halls, LLC for the completion of intersection improvements at Emory Road and Andersonville Pike in connection with the development known as Norris Freeway Commercial Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=301)|
| 0:05:16| Do we have a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=316)|
| 0:05:17| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=317)|
| 0:05:18| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=318)|
| 0:05:19| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=319)|
| 0:05:20| I had to pull this from consent, Dwight, because we had had some discussion about this last time, and I was wondering if you would give us a briefing on exactly what this agreement is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=320)|
| 0:05:27| Certainly, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=327)|
| 0:05:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=328)|
| 0:05:30| This has been a long time coming, but we are really excited to have it before the body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=330)|
| 0:05:34| As part of the original Wal-Mart project, when the use on review was approved in halls, there was requirement for intersection improvements at the intersection of Emory Road and Andersonville Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=334)|
| 0:05:45| The developer was preparing to make those improvements and, in fact, had equipment on the ground when one of the neighbors who was going to be affected by the project raised an objection to the alignment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=345)|
| 0:05:56| I won't get into two years' worth of details here, but the developer was asked to withdraw from the site until such time as those differences of opinion could be resolved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=356)|
| 0:06:07| It took a full year in order for us to get an alignment that worked, that everyone was in agreement with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=367)|
| 0:06:14| And by that time, the private side of the development had been completed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=374)|
| 0:06:17| The developer had demobilized and moved on to other projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=377)|
| 0:06:21| And we re-approached him with a request that we get the project started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=381)|
| 0:06:25| At that point, we got together and started probably a year's worth of discussion and negotiation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=385)|
| 0:06:30| And one of the things that became clear to us is that it would be better for the county to take this project and finish it as a county project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=390)|
| 0:06:37| because all of the work that's going to be done exists within the public right-of-way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=397)|
| 0:06:42| So, as a result of that, we've got this agreement before you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=402)|
| 0:06:45| It requires that the developer provide the equipment that he was originally going to install and $50,000 in cash.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=405)|
| 0:06:53| And that sum total will essentially represent the same amount of money that he had budgeted to complete the project in 2008-2009.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=413)|
| 0:07:03| We will absorb the cost for design changes that were driven by the county, as it seems the fair thing to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=423)|
| 0:07:10| And assuming that we get all the details worked out, we'd like to be under construction as early as July 1st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=430)|
| 0:07:16| I know Commissioner Smith probably hears this every day, seven days a week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=436)|
| 0:07:21| The congestion problems at the intersection need to be resolved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=441)|
| 0:07:24| We now have surface degradation in the road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=444)|
| 0:07:26| and we haven't been interested in making road improvements because we wanted to get this project started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=446)|
| 0:07:30| So, we're really excited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=450)|
| 0:07:32| We had hoped to have this in front of you today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=452)|
| 0:07:34| The agreement has been worked out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=454)|
| 0:07:36| Daniel Sanders in the law director's office has got all the particulars worked out with Mr. Waters, who represents the developer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=456)|
| 0:07:43| The developer will be here on Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=463)|
| 0:07:45| We'll be here on Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=465)|
| 0:07:46| So, if you had any more questions at that time, certainly we'd be glad to address them, or I'll answer any I can today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=466)|
| 0:07:53| I appreciate the fact you all want to be here on Monday, but we will not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=473)|
| 0:07:56| So, I just want to make sure that if he is here, he'll have an empty room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=476)|
| 0:08:01| Tuesday, for everyone watching, of course, Monday being Memorial Day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=481)|
| 0:08:06| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=486)|
| 0:08:07| Hey, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=487)|
| 0:08:08| So, you know, it has been a while since we first took this up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=488)|
| 0:08:11| So, this is a TIF, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=491)|
| 0:08:13| This was a TIF for this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=493)|
| 0:08:14| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=494)|
| 0:08:15| It is not a TIF.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=495)|
| 0:08:16| No public subsidies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=496)|
| 0:08:17| You know, Commissioner, when someone comes in with a private development and it has effect on public infrastructure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=497)|
| 0:08:22| sometimes as part of the approval process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=502)|
| 0:08:24| the MPC will request that improvements be made to public infrastructure to accommodate traffic generated by the new development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=504)|
| 0:08:32| And that was the case here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=512)|
| 0:08:34| And the developer was doing what he was asked to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=514)|
| 0:08:36| He literally had equipment on the ground and was getting ready to move dirt when the county asked him to cease and desist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=516)|
| 0:08:42| So, but there's no form of TIF or pilot or anything like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=522)|
| 0:08:46| We've simply had this issue come up with both right-of-way and alignment, and it's taken us this long to get those resolved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=526)|
| 0:08:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=533)|
| 0:08:54| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=534)|
| 0:08:55| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=535)|
| 0:08:56| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=536)|
| 0:08:57| Commissioner Brawls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=537)|
| 0:08:58| You said that there were design changes that were driven by the county that the county was going to cover.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=538)|
| 0:09:03| Do you know how much that's going to total?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=543)|
| 0:09:06| Our share of the project is going to be roughly commensurate with the developer's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=546)|
| 0:09:09| I think the developer is going to have about $140,000 in the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=549)|
| 0:09:13| We think we'll have between $140,000 and $150,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=553)|
| 0:09:16| What I can't do is tell you how much of that is attributable to design changes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=556)|
| 0:09:20| and how much is attributable to the fact that certain things have increased in the time that we've all been waiting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=560)|
| 0:09:25| Remember, they were on the ground in 2009.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=565)|
| 0:09:28| We're going to be on the ground in 2012.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=568)|
| 0:09:30| So certain variable commodities, like the asphalt price index, have gone up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=570)|
| 0:09:34| But it's roughly a proportional share.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=574)|
| 0:09:37| You said that Larry's getting phone calls about this seven days a week?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=577)|
| 0:09:41| Well, I would assume he is because we're getting them five days a week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=581)|
| 0:09:44| So we can't drag this out any longer for Larry?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=584)|
| 0:09:51| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=591)|
| 0:09:53| Dwight, you said, can you start that in June possibly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=593)|
| 0:09:56| Because the whole thing, what we're trying to do is for the summer while school's not going on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=596)|
| 0:10:00| so we can get that project in and out where there's less traffic and whatnot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=600)|
| 0:10:04| Is there any chance in that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=604)|
| 0:10:05| Well, Commissioner, we will be working in June.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=605)|
| 0:10:07| I just don't think we'll be moving dirt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=607)|
| 0:10:09| We still have a few utility issues to resolve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=609)|
| 0:10:11| We've got a couple more utility issues as far as getting them out of the right of way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=611)|
| 0:10:15| A little bit of final design work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=615)|
| 0:10:17| We'll be working in the month of June.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=617)|
| 0:10:18| I just don't know whether or not we'll be moving dirt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=618)|
| 0:10:20| But we're going to start moving it the first day we possibly can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=620)|
| 0:10:24| and get as far along as we can so that when school starts again in August,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=624)|
| 0:10:28| we've got a workable intersection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=628)|
| 0:10:30| And we're confident we'll be okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=630)|
| 0:10:32| I really wish we could do something with that bridge down there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=632)|
| 0:10:34| That would so help that school traffic if that bridge was a little bit wider| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=634)|
| 0:10:38| where people could sort of get over and get out of the way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=638)|
| 0:10:40| I know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=640)|
| 0:10:41| But anyway, if you can look at that, we'd appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=641)|
| 0:10:45| Motion is to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=645)|
| 0:10:47| It has been seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=647)|
| 0:10:48| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=648)|
| 0:10:49| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=649)|
| 0:10:50| Any opposition? Motion is approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=650)|
| 0:10:52| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=652)|
| 0:10:53| Dwight, you may want to stay because the next two items, I believe, are you as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=653)|
| 0:10:57| Number 24, Resolution 412.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=657)|
| 0:10:59| It's approving an amendment for the five-year extension to the agreement with the City of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=659)|
| 0:11:04| for the collection and disposal of household hazardous waste at the City of Knoxville Solid Waste Management Facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=664)|
| 0:11:10| Is there a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=670)|
| 0:11:12| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=672)|
| 0:11:14| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=674)|
| 0:11:15| Motion has been made and seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=675)|
| 0:11:16| Dwight, if you would brief us on this, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=676)|
| 0:11:17| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=677)|
| 0:11:18| Mr. Chairman, the City of Knoxville operates and the county jointly funds with them a hazardous household waste center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=678)|
| 0:11:26| It's actually on Baxter Avenue across from our office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=686)|
| 0:11:29| It's on the west side of I-75 on Baxter Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=689)|
| 0:11:32| This is a good deal for us and it's a good deal for the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=692)|
| 0:11:35| This is a facility that will take certain materials that we cannot take at convenience centers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=695)|
| 0:11:40| solvents, paint, fluorescent light bulbs, tube televisions and things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=700)|
| 0:11:46| Tom Salter is here and he can answer further questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=706)|
| 0:11:48| and give you a longer list of the things that we can't take at convenience centers that they do take at HHW.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=708)|
| 0:11:55| But it's a good arrangement for us because the city handles all of the regulatory components| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=715)|
| 0:11:59| that are associated with disposing of these kinds of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=719)|
| 0:12:02| And we have a place for your constituents to go when they have, again, things like fluorescent light bulbs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=722)|
| 0:12:08| solvents, paints and things like that that we're not equipped to take at convenience centers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=728)|
| 0:12:12| What's the location of that again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=732)|
| 0:12:14| It's off Baxter Avenue when you cross I-275 from, for instance, from our office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=734)|
| 0:12:22| It's on the left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=742)|
| 0:12:23| It may not actually front Baxter, but it sits in the little corner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=743)|
| 0:12:26| It's the street first left after you cross I-275, Elm Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=746)|
| 0:12:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=751)|
| 0:12:32| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=752)|
| 0:12:33| Well, I was just going to comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=753)|
| 0:12:34| It really is a great program if you ever have an opportunity to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=754)|
| 0:12:40| I know they have an amnesty day on the first Saturday each month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=760)|
| 0:12:45| and you can bring your household waste, which is a lot better going into the landfill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=765)|
| 0:12:50| So, no, I applaud you and Tom for coming up with this agreement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=770)|
| 0:12:55| because it's a good program for city and county residents alike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=775)|
| 0:13:00| Motion is to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=780)|
| 0:13:01| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=781)|
| 0:13:02| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=782)|
| 0:13:03| Any opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=783)|
| 0:13:04| It is approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=784)|
| 0:13:05| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=785)|
| 0:13:06| Next item is number 25, Resolution 413.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=786)|
| 0:13:08| It's approving a contract with FCC Environmental for Use Oil| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=788)|
| 0:13:12| and Hydrocarbon Collection and Recycling Services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=792)|
| 0:13:15| Is there a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=795)|
| 0:13:16| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=796)|
| 0:13:17| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=797)|
| 0:13:18| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=798)|
| 0:13:19| And, again, Dwight, is this the same location or is it a different location for this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=799)|
| 0:13:22| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=802)|
| 0:13:23| This actually serves the eight convenience centers that are located across the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=803)|
| 0:13:27| Each of those has a tank that receives used motor oil that folks bring in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=807)|
| 0:13:36| and this service will provide for the contractor to come empty those tanks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=816)|
| 0:13:42| and then dispose of it in a regulatory and an environmentally compliant manner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=822)|
| 0:13:46| I think it also has a broader scope of services that different departments can call on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=826)|
| 0:13:51| if they have other materials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=831)|
| 0:13:53| And I probably ought to let Tom speak to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=833)|
| 0:13:55| He handled the competitive solicitation with purchasing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=835)|
| 0:13:58| and he can give you a little bit more specifics on this one than I can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=838)|
| 0:14:03| Is your name and address to the record, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=843)|
| 0:14:05| Tom Salter, 1000 Sky Blue Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=845)|
| 0:14:09| This contract provides for the collection of used oil, oil filters, antifreeze.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=849)|
| 0:14:17| And we receive revenue from the sale of the oil under the new contract, and it's double.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=857)|
| 0:14:25| I think it's $1.40 or $1.50 a gallon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=865)|
| 0:14:27| That's double what we were receiving last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=867)|
| 0:14:30| And last year we were having to pay for the oil filter disposal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=870)|
| 0:14:35| and that metal and oil is worth enough where that's a no-cost solution now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=875)|
| 0:14:40| So this contract represents two revenue-positive changes over the contract we had last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=880)|
| 0:14:46| So we feel real good about the contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=886)|
| 0:14:48| It also provides for a fixed price for cleaning and repair of the receptacles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=888)|
| 0:14:55| And in the past, this was not part of the contract,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=895)|
| 0:14:57| and we had to go out and find vendors and get bids, like if it gets clogged up or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=897)|
| 0:15:04| And this contract includes that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=904)|
| 0:15:05| It also includes the collection of solvents used for cleaning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=905)|
| 0:15:10| and used oil at the county vehicle service center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=910)|
| 0:15:14| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=914)|
| 0:15:15| The motion is to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=915)|
| 0:15:16| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=916)|
| 0:15:17| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=917)|
| 0:15:18| Any opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=918)|
| 0:15:19| It is approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=919)|
| 0:15:20| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=920)|

| 0:15:24| The next item is on Page 6.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=924)|
| 0:15:26| It's Item Number 32, Resolution 605.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=926)|
| 0:15:30| It's approving a grant agreement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=930)|
| 0:15:31| and the amount of $535,400 requires an in-kind service match of $53,500| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=931)|
| 0:15:38| with the Tennessee Department of Health for the provision of public health emergency preparedness services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=938)|
| 0:15:44| Is there a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=944)|
| 0:15:46| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=946)|

| 0:15:48| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=948)|
| 0:15:49| Motion has been made and seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=949)|
| 0:15:50| Dr. Buchanan, I just had one question on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=950)|
| 0:15:51| When we say in-kind services match of $53,500, what do we mean by that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=951)|
| 0:15:56| That is other staff's time used toward preparedness efforts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=956)|
| 0:16:00| FluMist is a great example of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=960)|
| 0:16:02| That would be an in-kind contribution to this grant because it's part of our preparedness planning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=962)|
| 0:16:08| Any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=968)|
| 0:16:10| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=970)|

| 0:16:24| approving a contract with Kelly Fletcher PR, LLC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=984)|
| 0:16:28| to conduct a media campaign addressing teenage pregnancy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=988)|

| 0:17:41| Let's move now to our discussion items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=1061)|
| 0:17:43| That's what we have on our agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=1063)|
| 0:17:48| I would like to go ahead and do MPC as a budget item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=1068)|
| 0:17:52| And, Mr. Donaldson, I want to apologize to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=1072)|
| 0:17:54| I had intended for you to be on our agenda, and that is my fault.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=1074)|
| 0:17:58| I just completely neglected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=1078)|
| 0:18:00| And knowing that you do not want to feel neglected,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=1080)|
| 0:18:03| I knew you'd want to appear before us and talk about your budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=1083)|
| 0:18:06| So anything that you would like to share with us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=1086)|
| 0:18:09| Thank you, Mr. Chair and Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=1089)|
| 0:18:11| You make me feel special today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=1091)|
| 0:18:15| I just want to make you aware that the cuts proposed by the mayor in this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=1095)|
| 0:18:19| year's budget are getting down into bone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=1099)|
| 0:18:24| Last year we removed some flesh and muscle,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=1104)|
| 0:18:28| and through a change in procedures shifted from space costs as an in-kind| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=1108)|
| 0:18:37| contribution and central services as an in-kind contribution to a point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=1117)|
| 0:18:43| where they are literally deducted from the revenue that we do receive from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=1123)|
| 0:18:50| the county, in fact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=1130)|
| 0:18:51| So this year we requested $710,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=1131)|
| 0:18:56| Last year we received $646,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=1136)|
| 0:19:00| The mayor's proposal is for $546,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=1140)|
| 0:19:04| And when you deduct the value of the in-kind space and central services of about $186,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=1144)|
| 0:19:13| we're down to basically net proceeds to the Planning Commission of $360,000 this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=1153)|
| 0:19:21| That's in a $5.3 million budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=1161)|
| 0:19:26| Even starting with the $546,000 of revenue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=1166)|
| 0:19:33| the county is contributing just a little more than 10% of our total budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=1173)|
| 0:19:40| And it's down significantly from the year 2008-2009 when the value of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=1180)|
| 0:19:48| contribution from the county plus the value of the in-kind services was well over $1 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=1188)|
| 0:19:54| We're down to less than half a million dollars net.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=1194)|
| 0:19:59| And it compares to a contribution of $905,000 from the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=1199)|
| 0:20:07| The city is starting to push back against that arithmetic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=1207)|
| 0:20:13| But the $100,000 deduction from last year's contribution will result in us not being able to fill two positions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=1213)|
| 0:20:28| that we had been counting on filling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=1228)|
| 0:20:30| We had two recent retirements, one in addressing and one in GIS,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=1230)|
| 0:20:37| that we had hoped to fill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=1237)|
| 0:20:40| With the reduced revenues from Knox County, we will not be able to fill those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=1240)|
| 0:20:46| The net result of that is a diminished level of service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=1246)|
| 0:20:51| So people may have to wait to receive addresses as part of the permitting process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=1251)|
| 0:20:59| or as part of the certification for new financing that is a very common thing for the need for an address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=1259)|
| 0:21:13| And the updating of GIS maps, we may not be able to be as responsive as we have in the past| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=1273)|
| 0:21:25| as a result of not being able to fill these two positions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=1285)|
| 0:21:30| Just to put the Knox County contribution in perspective, we have 30, well, we had hoped to have filled 38 positions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=1290)|
| 0:21:41| The contributions from Knox County fill basically five of those 38.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=1301)|
| 0:21:49| The rest of it is from the city and through grants and contracts that we line up for the work that we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=1309)|
| 0:21:57| So I think we have reached the point where services will be diminished as a result of a continued trend| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=1317)|
| 0:22:10| in reducing the contributions to MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=1330)|
| 0:22:16| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=1336)|
| 0:22:21| I don't think I'm on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=1341)|
| 0:22:23| Mark, when we talk about the position in addressing and the position in GIS, what would be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=1343)|
| 0:22:30| I know we're not establishing addresses like we were in 2008.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=1350)|
| 0:22:35| I mean, prior to 2008, we were building more houses than you could probably address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=1355)|
| 0:22:39| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=1359)|
| 0:22:41| What decline have you seen in those two requests for services there in addressing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=1361)|
| 0:22:46| Well, in addressing, we have already reduced a staff of three down to two positions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=1366)|
| 0:22:53| And with this cut, we'll be down to one position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=1373)|
| 0:22:56| So we have no redundancy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=1376)|
| 0:22:59| And we were able to keep two people full time last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=1379)|
| 0:23:07| Amazingly, the number of addresses that are new addresses as a result of new homes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=1387)|
| 0:23:15| is a small fraction of the total addressing requests that we do get.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=1395)|
| 0:23:22| What about GIS?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=1402)|
| 0:23:24| GIS, we're in a position where we move from three people to two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=1404)|
| 0:23:32| We need to have that third person in order to respond to the requests that we get.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=1412)|
| 0:23:39| We continue to have the need to update the zoning maps, the plat maps, the base map, basically, for Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=1419)|
| 0:23:50| The base map for the county is made up of the collective maps of all of the subdivisions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=1430)|
| 0:23:56| and we are responsible for maintaining that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=1436)|
| 0:24:00| And the level of activity on administrative flats, the small ones,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=1440)|
| 0:24:06| the people that are dividing their property into three and four lots, continues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=1446)|
| 0:24:13| And basically, those are harder to deal with than the bigger subdivisions, frankly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=1453)|
| 0:24:20| So while the level, the quantity of work may have diminished over the last four years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=1460)|
| 0:24:27| the degree of difficulty has gone up dramatically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=1467)|
| 0:24:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=1472)|
| 0:24:33| Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=1473)|
| 0:24:34| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=1474)|
| 0:24:35| Thanks, Mark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=1475)|
| 0:24:37| Talk about that quantity of work relative to city, inside the city, inside the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=1477)|
| 0:24:44| and, again, go over what the city's contribution is compared to the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=1484)|
| 0:24:51| This year we requested $905,000 from the city, and they granted that for the third consecutive year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=1491)|
| 0:25:01| This year we requested $710,000 from the county, and we received $546,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=1501)|
| 0:25:07| In addition, we're being charged for that in-kind service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=1507)|
| 0:25:11| When we track just the number of applications that we receive, it breaks out roughly 55% county and 45% city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=1511)|
| 0:25:22| keeping in mind that every application that's in the city is also in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=1522)|
| 0:25:27| So that as we, you know, I live in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=1527)|
| 0:25:30| If I were to subdivide my land and build a new house on that, it would be a contribution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=1530)|
| 0:25:35| You know, it would be adding to the tax base of the county as well as the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=1535)|
| 0:25:40| So that 55%, 45% has been holding fairly true for the last several years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=1540)|
| 0:25:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=1551)|
| 0:25:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=1552)|
| 0:25:53| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=1553)|
| 0:25:54| So what was your request?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=1554)|
| 0:25:56| We requested $710,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=1556)|
| 0:25:59| That would have allowed us to fill those two positions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=1559)|
| 0:26:02| and do a couple of other technology upgrades that we would like to do in order to keep working efficiently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=1562)|
| 0:26:10| As a result of receiving less, we will have to punt those into the future, as well as not filling those two positions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=1570)|
| 0:26:20| Mr. Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=1580)|
| 0:26:21| Mark, talk just a little bit over the last couple of years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=1581)|
| 0:26:24| just go back two or three years, of your number one permits that you get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=1584)|
| 0:26:28| and how much you have raised the price on that for the people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=1588)|
| 0:26:32| Because that is an avenue for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=1592)|
| 0:26:35| What kind of percentage have you raised?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=1595)|
| 0:26:37| We adjusted our rates rather dramatically two years ago in order to maintain the same level of revenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=1597)|
| 0:26:46| We're actually taking in less fee revenue than five years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=1606)|
| 0:26:52| And we're maintaining the level that we have as a result of a fairly recent, fairly significant fee increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=1612)|
| 0:27:02| So going back to that well at this time probably would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=1622)|
| 0:27:06| I mean, what did you go up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=1626)|
| 0:27:07| Did you go up 50%, 30%?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=1627)|
| 0:27:08| What kind of increase did you get?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=1628)|
| 0:27:09| Well, it varied across the array of applications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=1629)|
| 0:27:15| In some situations, we went from not charging at all to charging nominal fees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=1635)|
| 0:27:19| In some cases, we literally doubled the fees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=1639)|
| 0:27:22| After doing a survey of comparable cities in the southeast,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=1642)|
| 0:27:25| we tried to reach a point where we felt we were in the midpoint of that comparable cities group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=1645)|
| 0:27:33| But, yeah, some of the fees doubled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=1653)|
| 0:27:36| And what kind of income did that generate for you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=1656)|
| 0:27:39| Well, we are projecting fee revenues of $384,000 for this next coming year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=1659)|
| 0:27:46| Our fees topped out at almost $600,000 five years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=1666)|
| 0:27:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=1671)|
| 0:27:53| Commissioner Burroughs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=1673)|
| 0:27:55| Yes, Mark, could you go over again the difference between the in-kind and being charged, please,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=1675)|
| 0:28:02| and the difference that it makes for MPC?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=1682)|
| 0:28:07| We have space in the city-county building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=1687)|
| 0:28:09| And until last year, that space was provided to us at no cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=1689)|
| 0:28:16| And it was reflected on our books as a $120,000 in-kind contribution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=1696)|
| 0:28:24| $120,000 being a snapshot of relatively comparable space probably five or six years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=1704)|
| 0:28:33| Last year, we literally now have that amount deducted from the contribution from Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=1713)|
| 0:28:42| We also have a fee for central services automatically deducted from the contribution by Knox County of about $66,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=1722)|
| 0:28:57| And that was determined as a result of a one-time study several years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=1737)|
| 0:29:05| trying to come up with the value of the services that payroll provides to us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=1745)|
| 0:29:13| the Human Resources Office provides to us, and other central offices of the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=1753)|
| 0:29:21| So what you're saying is that now that amount is being deducted from the 546?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=1761)|
| 0:29:26| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=1766)|
| 0:29:28| So, really, you're going to end up with even less.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=1768)|
| 0:29:31| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=1771)|
| 0:29:32| At the same time that this increase in our cost hit us, we got a deduction in the amount of revenue provided to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=1772)|
| 0:29:42| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=1782)|
| 0:29:44| Mr. Donaldson, thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=1784)|
| 0:29:45| We'll be taking up the budget, of course, next Tuesday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=1785)|
| 0:29:47| Thanks for the opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=1787)|
| 0:29:48| No, Wednesday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=1788)|
| 0:29:49| I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=1789)|
| 0:29:51| Commissioner Burroughs, you have listed the size and number of commission districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=1791)|
| 0:29:54| Did you want to discuss that today?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=1794)|
| 0:29:55| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=1795)|
| 0:29:56| Actually, I'm going to defer that one more month in light of more important issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=1796)|
| 0:30:00| And also, Ms. B. DeSelm is not going to be joining us today, but she will be here on Tuesday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=1800)|
| 0:30:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=1807)|
| 0:30:08| Commissioner Norman, you wanted to discuss the budget?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=1808)|
| 0:30:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=1811)|
| 0:30:12| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=1812)|
| 0:30:14| Given all of the detail and intricacy of the school budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=1814)|
| 0:30:21| I was wondering if our body might be interested in asking the mayor to possibly postpone the special called meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=1821)|
| 0:30:33| and vote on the budget on the 30th for at least a week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=1833)|
| 0:30:41| And I'm just throwing that out to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=1841)|
| 0:30:43| I don't know what the feeling of my colleagues are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=1843)|
| 0:30:47| But I personally would think it would be beneficial to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=1847)|
| 0:30:51| It might give us some time to weigh some other alternatives to, you know, the up-down variety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=1851)|
| 0:30:59| And so I just wanted to offer that for discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=1859)|
| 0:31:03| Commissioner Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=1863)|
| 0:31:05| I wouldn't necessarily disagree with what Tony said, but I believe it was last December.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=1865)|
| 0:31:10| I told the mayor that I was planning on a family trip.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=1870)|
| 0:31:14| And when did he think that he would be putting this on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=1874)|
| 0:31:17| He thought about it, got back to me, and he says, I'll try to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=1877)|
| 0:31:20| I didn't give him the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=1880)|
| 0:31:21| I just said, I'd like to know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=1881)|
| 0:31:23| And he told me he would plan on doing it before the 1st of June.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=1883)|
| 0:31:27| And I have a trip planned where I'm going to be out of town for about two and a half weeks, starting on the ‑‑| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=1887)|
| 0:31:33| I think Monday is the 4th of June.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=1893)|
| 0:31:35| This is the 5th of June.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=1895)|
| 0:31:36| It's a Tuesday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=1896)|
| 0:31:38| I would be available on the 5th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=1898)|
| 0:31:40| You know, that would be six days later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=1900)|
| 0:31:44| But, I mean, I'm sorry, on the 4th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=1904)|
| 0:31:47| I don't have my calendar here, but I know these dates because I know what my airline flights are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=1907)|
| 0:31:51| It's on the 5th that I leave, which I believe is a Tuesday, and I believe that Monday is the 4th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=1911)|
| 0:31:56| I'm just saying if we do decide to do this, that I would be available on the 4th but not on the 5th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=1916)|
| 0:32:02| And it would be important for all commissioners to be present, so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=1922)|
| 0:32:04| I think so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=1924)|
| 0:32:06| Any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=1926)|
| 0:32:07| I'm in the same boat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=1927)|
| 0:32:08| I've got two trips that I have to go, so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=1928)|
| 0:32:13| Any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=1933)|
| 0:32:15| I guess what I'm hearing is that ‑‑| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=1935)|
| 0:32:20| Larry, are you available in June?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=1940)|
| 0:32:24| Yeah, a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=1944)|
| 0:32:25| I think I'm 4th or 5th, something like that, about the same time as Doc's leaving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=1945)|
| 0:32:28| I've got to go to Nebraska, I think, the day we vote on Wednesday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=1948)|
| 0:32:34| I'm going to Nebraska Thursday and Friday, and I'll be back that Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=1954)|
| 0:32:39| And then I'll leave out again, I think, on Tuesday or Wednesday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=1959)|
| 0:32:42| But that Monday, I know I'm in town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=1962)|
| 0:32:44| Tony, would you be able to be more comfortable if we made that decision tomorrow night?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=1964)|
| 0:32:48| Tomorrow night we meet at Calhoun's, and I think there's going to be some discussion tomorrow night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=1968)|
| 0:32:52| After that discussion, would you be more comfortable setting a date then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=1972)|
| 0:32:55| Yeah, that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=1975)|
| 0:32:57| But, Larry, you think you would be available on the 4th?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=1977)|
| 0:33:02| And Dr. Briggs would be available on the 4th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=1982)|
| 0:33:05| I'll know for sure at our meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=1985)|
| 0:33:07| I'll have my calendar with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=1987)|
| 0:33:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=1988)|
| 0:33:09| I'd like that better than what we've got right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=1989)|
| 0:33:12| I mean, it does give some extra time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=1992)|
| 0:33:14| So we can talk about it tomorrow night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=1994)|
| 0:33:16| And we'll put that on the agenda to discuss.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=1996)|
| 0:33:17| We are meeting at 5 at Calhoun's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=1997)|
| 0:33:20| Also, with regards to the budget, at the Chairman's lunch on Tuesday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=2000)|
| 0:33:25| I'm not saying that there will be, but there has been discussion of a possible mayoral override| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=2005)|
| 0:33:30| should a budget be proposed with a tax increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=2010)|
| 0:33:34| The Charter is specific as to how we are to conduct business should that happen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=2014)|
| 0:33:39| and should we be getting into that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=2019)|
| 0:33:42| I've asked Mr. Jarrett to prepare a presentation for us so that we fully understand,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=2022)|
| 0:33:46| according to the Charter, what would be our responsibilities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=2026)|
| 0:33:50| and what would be the mayor's responsibilities under that scenario.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=2030)|
| 0:33:53| Again, I'm not saying that will happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=2033)|
| 0:33:54| I'm just saying that we as a commission need to be fully informed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=2034)|
| 0:33:57| and we need to understand what the Charter says.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=2037)|
| 0:34:00| Yes, Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=2040)|
| 0:34:02| Are we going to hear from Kathy Quiz and Joel McCroskey?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=2042)|
| 0:34:05| Yes, next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=2045)|
| 0:34:06| At the luncheon?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=2046)|
| 0:34:07| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=2047)|
| 0:34:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=2048)|
| 0:34:09| Yes, either the luncheon or the other one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=2049)|
| 0:34:10| Yes, we will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=2050)|
| 0:34:12| We are now ready to move into the public forum section of our meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=2052)|
| 0:34:16| And we have a number of people who have asked to be heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=2056)|
| 0:34:19| And we'd like to remind you that you will have up to five minutes to address commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=2059)|
| 0:34:24| on any of the items that you would like to address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=2064)|
| 0:34:27| I understand Ms. DeSelma is not here, so the next person is Ernest Schmidt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=2067)|
| 0:34:32| Is Ernest Schmidt here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=2072)|
| 0:34:33| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=2073)|
| 0:34:34| If you'd like to come to the podium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=2074)|
| 0:34:35| And if you would give us your name and address for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=2075)|
| 0:34:38| And you will have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=2078)|
| 0:34:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=2081)|
| 0:34:42| My name is Ernest Schmidt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=2082)|
| 0:34:43| I live at 1220 Eagle Nest Lane in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=2083)|
| 0:34:47| And I wanted to thank you for the opportunity to come to you today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=2087)|
| 0:34:50| and address Superintendent McIntyre's proposal to add an additional $35 million over the next five years for each year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=2090)|
| 0:34:59| to Knox County's budget in order to improve the quality of education in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=2099)|
| 0:35:06| Many organizations, mainly those involved in some form of education, have all spoken in favor of the increase in the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=2106)|
| 0:35:14| I'm here to speak on behalf of the silent majority,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=2114)|
| 0:35:17| those of us who are retired, live on a fixed income,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=2117)|
| 0:35:20| have watched our real estate prices plummet over the last few years while our taxes have remained the same,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=2120)|
| 0:35:26| those working for minimum wages, the underemployed, the unemployed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=2126)|
| 0:35:31| and many of us who simply don't understand why adding $35 million to the school budget will improve the quality of education| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=2131)|
| 0:35:40| when money really isn't the problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=2140)|
| 0:35:43| Let me cite for you some facts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=2143)|
| 0:35:45| Worldwide, the U.S. ranks fourth in the world in average cost per student with an average cost of $6,411 per student.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=2145)|
| 0:35:57| Only Denmark, Switzerland, and Austria spend more per student than does the U.S.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=2157)|
| 0:36:03| In the April 29th edition of the Knox News Sentinel, it was reported that Knox County has 57,812 students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=2163)|
| 0:36:11| and has spent $385 million for the 2011-2012 school year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=2171)|
| 0:36:17| That's $6,660 per student.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=2177)|
| 0:36:21| We already exceed the national average, so money obviously is not a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=2181)|
| 0:36:27| Both Estonia and Poland, students rank equivalent to those in the U.S. in testing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=2187)|
| 0:36:34| at less than half the cost that we spend in the United States per student.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=2194)|
| 0:36:39| Money obviously is not the problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=2199)|
| 0:36:42| When ranked against other countries in the world, the U.S. ranks 14th in reading, 17th in science, 25th in math.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=2202)|
| 0:36:50| We rank a distant 12th compared to other world countries, yet only three exceed us in the amount spent per student.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=2210)|
| 0:36:57| There are obviously other countries who have found out how to educate their students at far less cost than we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=2217)|
| 0:37:04| To improve the education in Knox County, we need to look at these other countries that are achieving higher scores| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=2224)|
| 0:37:10| at less cost and determine what they're doing to improve the quality of education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=2230)|
| 0:37:15| Number one, you will find that teachers in other countries have far more authority in the classroom| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=2235)|
| 0:37:20| than we allow our teachers to here in the United States.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=2240)|
| 0:37:24| In the U.S., they're given, quote, a standard curriculum,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=2244)|
| 0:37:27| and all students are expected to try to learn that curriculum rather than becoming educated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=2247)|
| 0:37:33| Students in other countries' schools attend for longer hours each day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=2253)|
| 0:37:38| In Japan, for instance, the average day consists of almost eight hours per day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=2258)|
| 0:37:43| with additional hours for their advanced students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=2263)|
| 0:37:50| Students are required to attend school for more days per year than in the U.S.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=2270)|
| 0:37:54| Our average school years, I read in the paper, were 175 instructional days, whereas in China, it is 240 days of instruction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=2274)|
| 0:38:04| In 12 years of education, the average Chinese student has received the equivalent, compared to our 175 days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=2284)|
| 0:38:12| of four and a half years of additional instruction before they graduate from high school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=2292)|
| 0:38:18| The state of Tennessee ranks 33rd nationwide in average teacher salaries, with an average salary of $45,926.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=2298)|
| 0:38:26| And while this may seem low to some, when you take into consideration that the average working person's salary in Tennessee is $35,390,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=2306)|
| 0:38:36| one can see that we're already spending more of each person's average salary than most of the states.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=2316)|
| 0:38:43| My suggestion would be, before spending an additional $35 million for the next five years without any accountability,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=2323)|
| 0:38:50| let's send Superintendent McIntyre to Japan, China, maybe even Estonia or Poland,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=2330)|
| 0:38:55| and see what they do to achieve higher scores at less cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=2335)|
| 0:39:00| Don't forget, you've just had people up here asking for more money in their each county budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=2340)|
| 0:39:05| You're faced with a pension plan that could bankrupt a lot of counties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=2345)|
| 0:39:09| And if you add another $175 million on top of that, you're looking at a bankrupt county in the next five years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=2349)|
| 0:39:16| Before we make the decision to add $175 million to the budget, I would ask Superintendent McIntyre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=2356)|
| 0:39:23| where's the accountability for the first $385 million, which I think is what our mayor is asking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=2363)|
| 0:39:30| I've got these numbers, and I can provide you with additional numbers if you would like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=2370)|
| 0:39:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=2373)|
| 0:39:34| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=2374)|
| 0:39:35| We appreciate your being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=2375)|
| 0:39:37| Next we have Dwayne Crager.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=2377)|
| 0:39:41| Dwayne Crager.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=2381)|
| 0:39:47| Should he come before we're through, we'll be happy to hear from him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=2387)|
| 0:39:50| But we'll move on to Keith Goodwin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=2390)|
| 0:39:54| Mr. Goodwin, thank you for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=2394)|
| 0:39:55| And if you'd give us your name and address for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=2395)|
| 0:40:01| Keith Goodwin, 2018 Clinch Avenue here in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=2401)|
| 0:40:05| And thank you for allowing me to come and speak on behalf of the proposed Knox school budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=2405)|
| 0:40:10| Let me start my remarks with a story.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=2410)|
| 0:40:13| Two years ago in the middle of the debate over health care reform, I sent an e-mail to President Obama| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=2413)|
| 0:40:18| and said that what I was reading about health care reform had little to do with health care reform| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=2418)|
| 0:40:25| and had everything to do with health care finance reform.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=2425)|
| 0:40:28| And while I appreciated the importance of the discussion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=2428)|
| 0:40:31| I suggested that he would do well to concentrate on those systemic issues that I believe contribute to bad health.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=2431)|
| 0:40:36| Specifically, I suggested three things for consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=2436)|
| 0:40:40| First, that we eliminate all direct drug sales to consumers because I think most of that on television is marginal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=2440)|
| 0:40:48| in terms of its utility, maximum in terms of profitability for drug companies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=2448)|
| 0:40:52| Second, I requested that he consider adding 30 minutes of physical education mandatorily| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=2452)|
| 0:40:57| in schools from kindergarten through high school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=2457)|
| 0:41:00| My thought there was we needed to teach children active life skills, not just educational content.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=2460)|
| 0:41:06| And third, I wanted a constitutional amendment prohibiting tobacco use and growth and distribution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=2466)|
| 0:41:12| And for the record, he didn't respond to my e-mail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=2472)|
| 0:41:14| But it was a good thought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=2474)|
| 0:41:17| And the recommendations that I made were an attempt to say that we needed to get at the core issues associated with poor health| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=2477)|
| 0:41:23| if we were going to have really a chance to fix the problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=2483)|
| 0:41:26| And what I was asking for more than anything else was leadership from the executive office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=2486)|
| 0:41:31| Today I'm asking for your attention and your leadership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=2491)|
| 0:41:34| I will not review the statistics and the budget specifics provided by Dr. McIntyre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=2494)|
| 0:41:38| and overwhelmingly approved, I might add, by the school board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=2498)|
| 0:41:42| You've all read these documents and reviewed the proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=2502)|
| 0:41:45| That said, it seems to me that Dr. McIntyre is attempting to implement a plan that everyone has already agreed on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=2505)|
| 0:41:51| As any good CEO should do, he's managed his resources and he's kept his overhead down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=2511)|
| 0:41:56| He's worked with you and the school board to identify ambitious goals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=2516)|
| 0:42:00| The goals that have been established for Knox County are very much in alignment with both the goals of the state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=2520)|
| 0:42:05| and the governor associated with improving the educational performance of our students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=2525)|
| 0:42:10| What's being requested is the funding necessary to implement this plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=2530)|
| 0:42:15| When I came to Knoxville about five years ago, 54% of our patients at Children's Hospital were part of the TennCare program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=2535)|
| 0:42:21| TennCare and Medicaid in general across the country serves as a health insurance safety net for children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=2541)|
| 0:42:27| When parents lose or don't have insurance, in most instances, children can be covered through TennCare.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=2547)|
| 0:42:33| Since my arrival five years ago, the Children's Hospital TennCare percentage has increased from 54% to 64%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=2553)|
| 0:42:40| TennCare provides funding for about 68% of the costs associated with the services that we provide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=2560)|
| 0:42:46| This increase in TennCare costs literally cost the state's millions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=2566)|
| 0:42:49| and cost Children's Hospital about $1 million per 1% increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=2569)|
| 0:42:54| Importantly, the growth we've seen closely correlates with the overall economy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=2574)|
| 0:42:59| To dig out of the economy hole that we're in, we need jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=2579)|
| 0:43:03| And to obtain jobs, we need an educated workforce.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=2583)|
| 0:43:06| It seems to me that education system's purpose, amongst others,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=2586)|
| 0:43:10| is to create an educated and ultimately employable workforce.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=2590)|
| 0:43:14| Children's Hospital's job is to care for those who are sick or injured| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=2594)|
| 0:43:17| and whenever we can, to implement solutions that prevent children from becoming sick or injured to begin with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=2597)|
| 0:43:23| Over my 35 years of experience working in Children's Hospitals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=2603)|
| 0:43:26| I've reached the conclusion that the better educated the parents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=2606)|
| 0:43:30| the less likely it is that their children will become sick and injured and need our services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=2610)|
| 0:43:35| What we do is clearly important and I'm extremely proud of our team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=2615)|
| 0:43:38| However, to some degree, we're addressing the problem after the fact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=2618)|
| 0:43:42| As a hospital and as a community, we need to look upstream and fix issues before they become problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=2622)|
| 0:43:48| One of the most important ways to do this is through education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=2628)|
| 0:43:52| I've had the privilege over the last three years to work on Friday afternoon| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=2632)|
| 0:43:56| or Friday mornings, rather, with Ms. Jennifer Turpin at Westview Elementary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=2636)|
| 0:44:00| helping teach kindergarten students how to read.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=2640)|
| 0:44:03| I don't think I've ever worked with a more dedicated teacher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=2643)|
| 0:44:06| She works with challenging students and in many instances, students who have difficult family situations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=2646)|
| 0:44:12| She's excited about the direction the school system is headed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=2652)|
| 0:44:15| and only wants the resources she needs to help her children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=2655)|
| 0:44:19| Shortly after arriving in Knoxville, I had a chance to participate in the Introduction Knoxville program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=2659)|
| 0:44:25| During one of our initial sessions, I had the pleasure to listen to Dr. Bruce Wheeler talk about the history of our city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=2665)|
| 0:44:30| He talked about how it had grown following the Civil War| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=2670)|
| 0:44:33| and how we had been positioned for greatness around the turn of the century.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=2673)|
| 0:44:37| However, he also talked about how the community leadership, through their thoughts and their actions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=2677)|
| 0:44:41| ultimately rejected the chance to take the next step.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=2681)|
| 0:44:44| And with that in mind, he felt we were 100 years later, we were once again positioned to take a leap forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=2684)|
| 0:44:51| Mr. Goodwin, your time is just about up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=2691)|
| 0:44:52| I'm almost done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=2692)|
| 0:44:53| One more paragraph.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=2693)|
| 0:44:55| There are many things that make a community great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=2695)|
| 0:44:58| One of our greatness is having a core infrastructure that supports the needs of our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=2698)|
| 0:45:02| When I think about those key infrastructure elements that are necessary for success,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=2702)|
| 0:45:06| education and health care are critical, just as critical as roads, the arts, and the education system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=2706)|
| 0:45:12| So I thank you for your time, and I thank you for giving this consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=2712)|
| 0:45:16| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=2716)|
| 0:45:20| Next we have Jerry Martin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=2720)|
| 0:45:30| And if you would give us your name and address of the record, please, and you will have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=2730)|
| 0:45:35| I'm Jerry Martin, 11716 North Monticello in Farragut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=2735)|
| 0:45:41| I am the president of the Farragut High School Education Foundation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=2741)|
| 0:45:44| and it's on behalf of the foundation that I'm here to address you all today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=2744)|
| 0:45:48| The foundation was formed approximately 20 years ago with the goal of promoting educational excellence at Farragut High School,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=2748)|
| 0:45:56| with its primary task to be to bring technology.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=2756)|
| 0:46:01| You know, 20 years ago we didn't have the computers and everything we have now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=2761)|
| 0:46:05| So the foundation set out on a very ambitious goal to bring technology into the high school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=2765)|
| 0:46:11| not to have to pay for everyday expenses that should be covered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=2771)|
| 0:46:16| Over that 20 years, unfortunately, the education foundation, we have found ourselves having to pay for basic expenses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=2776)|
| 0:46:24| For example, a few years ago the education foundation worked hard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=2784)|
| 0:46:29| raised tens of thousands of dollars to buy cafeteria furniture for the Farragut High School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=2789)|
| 0:46:36| Now why did the foundation do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=2796)|
| 0:46:38| Well, because the furniture that was there was what was put in the school in 1978,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=2798)|
| 0:46:43| had not been replaced, and the students didn't have enough chairs and tables to sit at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=2803)|
| 0:46:49| So the foundation did that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=2809)|
| 0:46:52| A couple years ago we had very energetic teachers at Farragut High School who asked,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=2812)|
| 0:46:57| what can we do to just make our school and our different wings look better?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=2817)|
| 0:47:02| And they said, well, we'd like to have it painted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=2822)|
| 0:47:05| And the question was put forth, well, what would we have to do to get the county to paint the school?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=2825)|
| 0:47:10| Well, they were told it was on a 6, 7, 8, 9, 10-year rotation, whatever that may be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=2830)|
| 0:47:16| Those teachers wanted to take the initiative, however, and said we want to spruce it up, make our school look better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=2836)|
| 0:47:22| So the foundation, out of the funds that we worked hard to raise, bought paint,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=2842)|
| 0:47:27| bought the painting supplies, and the teachers and students provided the labor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=2847)|
| 0:47:32| This is not the way a school system should be run.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=2852)|
| 0:47:35| A school, foundations, and parents shouldn't have to be called upon to go out and do fundraising| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=2855)|
| 0:47:43| to pay for the basic necessities to run a school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=2863)|
| 0:47:46| But that's what we're finding having to happen not just at Farragut High School but schools all across Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=2866)|
| 0:47:52| We are trying our best at Farragut through the foundation to promote many goals that help students learn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=2872)|
| 0:48:00| We sponsor scholarships for students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=2880)|
| 0:48:03| Wednesday of this week, I'll have the pleasure of presenting awards to six teachers at Farragut High School| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=2883)|
| 0:48:11| that the foundation has recognized for their outstanding service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=2891)|
| 0:48:15| We need to work hard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=2895)|
| 0:48:17| We need to find ways to promote and retention of our teachers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=2897)|
| 0:48:21| because we are losing teachers to other school systems because of pay and benefits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=2901)|
| 0:48:26| We're losing teachers to private industry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=2906)|
| 0:48:30| Well, maybe we can't compete with private industry,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=2910)|
| 0:48:33| but we've got to be able to compete with our neighboring school systems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=2913)|
| 0:48:37| Maryville and Oak Ridge, for example, pay significantly more to their teachers and administrators in both pay and benefits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=2917)|
| 0:48:43| and we have lost a lot of good quality educators to those school systems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=2923)|
| 0:48:48| So we've got to do what we can to retain those educators.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=2928)|
| 0:48:53| Knox County, I think, trains a lot of these good educators.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=2933)|
| 0:48:56| We get them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=2936)|
| 0:48:57| They work hard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=2937)|
| 0:48:59| They're successful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=2939)|
| 0:49:00| And then, unfortunately, because of finances, and I can't fault any teacher or educator for going,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=2940)|
| 0:49:07| especially when they have families to support,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=2947)|
| 0:49:09| to going to another school system where they can get better pay and benefits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=2949)|
| 0:49:13| But we shouldn't let that be the reason why we're losing good quality educators.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=2953)|
| 0:49:18| We are working hard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=2958)|
| 0:49:20| We'll continue to work hard at Farragut High School and through the foundation to raise money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=2960)|
| 0:49:25| to pay for things that we can,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=2965)|
| 0:49:28| but we would really think that the passing of this budget will go a long ways to getting the very basic things that need to be provided| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=2968)|
| 0:49:37| so that the foundation can go back to getting the extras, to put us over the top,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=2977)|
| 0:49:42| because as Ben mentioned, there's no substitute for having great schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=2982)|
| 0:49:47| If you want to see your property values decline, don't have great schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=2987)|
| 0:49:52| We've got to support Dr. McIntyre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=2992)|
| 0:49:55| It's been a bold proposal on his part, on the part of the school board, and we need to pass this budget as proposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=2995)|
| 0:50:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=3002)|
| 0:50:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=3004)|
| 0:50:07| Next is Vic Spencer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=3007)|
| 0:50:13| Could you give us your name and address for the record, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=3013)|
| 0:50:15| And you'll have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=3015)|
| 0:50:19| My name is Vic Spencer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=3019)|
| 0:50:21| I live at 11012 Flotilla Drive in Farragut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=3021)|
| 0:50:31| With your permission, I will deviate a little bit from the theme of money in general,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=3031)|
| 0:50:40| and I would like to tell you that what I found,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=3040)|
| 0:50:47| having become interested in the state of education here during the past seven years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=3047)|
| 0:50:54| is that if we look at the state report card,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=3054)|
| 0:51:01| if we look at especially the ninth graders,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=3061)|
| 0:51:08| only 74% of them end up with a regular diploma.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=3068)|
| 0:51:16| That by itself is not so tragic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=3076)|
| 0:51:20| but when we look at the ACT report on what these diplomas are worth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=3080)|
| 0:51:26| that's where the real question comes up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=3086)|
| 0:51:31| And ACT says that only 19% of the regular diplomas in Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=3091)|
| 0:51:41| are college ready or ready to learn a job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=3101)|
| 0:51:47| And ACT does have a document where they equated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=3107)|
| 0:51:52| the learning of a job and going into college to enter a freshman year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=3112)|
| 0:51:57| exactly the same way with the same requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=3117)|
| 0:52:02| So whether one agrees with this or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=3122)|
| 0:52:06| I think it's tough to argue and blame the state for their figures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=3126)|
| 0:52:11| I think it's tough to blame ACT,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=3131)|
| 0:52:14| who are a first-class national organization, for their figures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=3134)|
| 0:52:19| And we are also finding, as the gentleman before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=3139)|
| 0:52:23| the first gentleman mentioned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=3143)|
| 0:52:25| that from the educational point of view,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=3145)|
| 0:52:27| the U.S. has dropped significantly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=3147)|
| 0:52:30| I found that we are, last year, we hit 52nd in the world| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=3150)|
| 0:52:35| in science and mathematics out of 136 countries,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=3155)|
| 0:52:40| and 32nd in math out of 65 countries,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=3160)|
| 0:52:47| under the OECD PISA measurement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=3167)|
| 0:52:50| This is not good news, because the world is becoming smaller,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=3170)|
| 0:52:57| and as you can see on all the products that you see in stores,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=3177)|
| 0:53:01| or on the street, we are now competing worldwide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=3181)|
| 0:53:05| And that competition goes down to the grammar schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=3185)|
| 0:53:09| It starts from first grade on through high school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=3189)|
| 0:53:13| as the primary pipeline for higher education| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=3193)|
| 0:53:16| or for more competency in a job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=3196)|
| 0:53:21| I attended all three of the meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=3201)|
| 0:53:29| that were held here in Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=3209)|
| 0:53:33| to try to solve this problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=3213)|
| 0:53:35| The first one was attended by 2,000 people from industry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=3215)|
| 0:53:41| The second, a year and a half later, was attended by 600.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=3221)|
| 0:53:47| And the third one, the second and the third one I attended,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=3227)|
| 0:53:50| the third one was attended by approximately 200 people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=3230)|
| 0:53:54| I managed to talk to three quarters of the third group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=3234)|
| 0:53:58| And the message has been solid since day one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=3238)|
| 0:54:03| since seven years back,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=3243)|
| 0:54:07| that our critical problem is that our graduates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=3247)|
| 0:54:10| cannot communicate in English properly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=3250)|
| 0:54:13| and cannot even do basic math.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=3253)|
| 0:54:17| And as I kept in touch with these people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=3257)|
| 0:54:19| that story hasn't changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=3259)|
| 0:54:20| So I would say that approving $35 million for a year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=3260)|
| 0:54:27| and not perpetually is not a major issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=3267)|
| 0:54:32| but the quality of education that we are delivering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=3272)|
| 0:54:35| is a major issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=3275)|
| 0:54:37| And I would say that Dr. McIntyre's job| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=3277)|
| 0:54:41| is certainly not the easiest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=3281)|
| 0:54:43| He is, in my opinion, between a rock and a hard place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=3283)|
| 0:54:49| But somehow we have to find a way to do better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=3289)|
| 0:54:52| And one step would be to look at the top performers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=3292)|
| 0:54:55| as another gentleman indicated here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=3295)|
| 0:54:58| and see what they are doing better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=3298)|
| 0:55:00| Because when you're 52nd,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=3300)|
| 0:55:02| the first one and the second one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=3302)|
| 0:55:04| does have better tricks available for you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=3304)|
| 0:55:08| than what you are going to dream up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=3308)|
| 0:55:10| in your own sinking sandbox, so to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=3310)|
| 0:55:14| And this is not a derogatory remark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=3314)|
| 0:55:16| Mr. Spencer, your time is just about up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=3316)|
| 0:55:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=3318)|
| 0:55:19| It is up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=3319)|
| 0:55:20| May I take another minute to finish, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=3320)|
| 0:55:22| Do you want to give him another minute?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=3322)|
| 0:55:24| Yes, okay, another minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=3324)|
| 0:55:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=3325)|
| 0:55:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=3326)|
| 0:55:30| I think that you, ladies and gentlemen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=3330)|
| 0:55:33| are really excellent and very kind people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=3333)|
| 0:55:35| to give me that extra time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=3335)|
| 0:55:37| And I don't care what anybody else says| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=3337)|
| 0:55:39| in politics in this county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=3339)|
| 0:55:43| Just trying to be funny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=3343)|
| 0:55:45| So I try to smile.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=3345)|
| 0:55:48| And I have a jacket on today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=3348)|
| 0:55:50| And what can I tell you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=3350)|
| 0:55:52| The last time I did not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=3352)|
| 0:55:54| I would say that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=3354)|
| 0:56:00| the most important thing is that the public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=3360)|
| 0:56:02| is entitled to the truth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=3362)|
| 0:56:06| They are not getting that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=3366)|
| 0:56:08| At least I'm not seeing it in the newspapers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=3368)|
| 0:56:11| I think that when we get to budget approvals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=3371)|
| 0:56:14| it would not be a bad idea to have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=3374)|
| 0:56:16| an ACT score consolidated average| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=3376)|
| 0:56:21| included as a target in that budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=3381)|
| 0:56:24| and an operating plan that specifies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=3384)|
| 0:56:27| as to what each school should achieve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=3387)|
| 0:56:30| to hit that number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=3390)|
| 0:56:32| To get budget approvals, money approvals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=3392)|
| 0:56:34| without such an operating plan makes no sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=3394)|
| 0:56:40| You have exceeded your minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=3400)|
| 0:56:42| Thank you very much for giving me an extra minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=3402)|
| 0:56:44| And if anyone has any questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=3404)|
| 0:56:46| I would be happy to answer them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=3406)|
| 0:56:48| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=3408)|
| 0:56:49| We appreciate you being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=3409)|
| 0:56:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=3410)|
| 0:56:51| Next we have Jamie Dobbs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=3411)|
| 0:56:55| Jamie Dobbs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=3415)|
| 0:56:58| And if you would give us your address for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=3418)|
| 0:57:00| And you'll have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=3420)|
| 0:57:02| Yes, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=3422)|
| 0:57:03| My name is Jamie Dobbs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=3423)|
| 0:57:04| I'm President of the League of Women Voters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=3424)|
| 0:57:06| And I live at 2509 Lakefront Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=3426)|
| 0:57:09| And I want to first begin by thanking all of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=3429)|
| 0:57:15| I've, as League President, have been at events| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=3435)|
| 0:57:19| and I've run into you and I've spoken to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=3439)|
| 0:57:22| And I really appreciate the exchange of information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=3442)|
| 0:57:27| And I appreciate what, really, your interaction with lots of us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=3447)|
| 0:57:33| to help us learn more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=3453)|
| 0:57:34| And that's the League greatly, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=3454)|
| 0:57:38| we are very dedicated to education of citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=3458)|
| 0:57:41| And we're trying to share that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=3461)|
| 0:57:44| And as you know, the League has put in hundreds of hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=3464)|
| 0:57:53| We are, we pride ourselves in being active, informed citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=3473)|
| 0:57:59| There are about 180 of us in our membership now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=3479)|
| 0:58:02| But we're also allied with many other groups here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=3482)|
| 0:58:08| Our education committee joined with others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=3488)|
| 0:58:11| We have a list serve of over 1,000 people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=3491)|
| 0:58:15| that have been following what you all are doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=3495)|
| 0:58:18| and the information that has been shared.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=3498)|
| 0:58:22| We've been gathering facts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=3502)|
| 0:58:23| You've seen that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=3503)|
| 0:58:26| We support our schools, which is the group that spun off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=3506)|
| 0:58:31| It represents what we think are thousands and thousands of people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=3511)|
| 0:58:35| who support an investment in this budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=3515)|
| 0:58:40| And, you know, we are not asking for something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=3520)|
| 0:58:46| that we haven't done some research on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=3526)|
| 0:58:49| We aren't asking for something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=3529)|
| 0:58:51| We're people that would take, that would sacrifice on our own| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=3531)|
| 0:58:57| to improve the lives and the education of children in this county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=3537)|
| 0:59:05| And we have reported that our tax rates have not increased in 12 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=3545)|
| 0:59:16| We haven't been asked to sacrifice or make an investment for our kids| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=3556)|
| 0:59:24| like the other counties have done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=3564)|
| 0:59:27| They ask their residents over and over again to invest in their kids| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=3567)|
| 0:59:35| and invest in their county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=3575)|
| 0:59:37| And so I was talking to my husband the other day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=3577)|
| 0:59:41| You know, you don't make an investment by giving somebody money for a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=3581)|
| 0:59:50| You know, we're talking about a raise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=3590)|
| 0:59:52| We're not talking about an increase in allowance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=3592)|
| 0:59:56| We're talking about a real raise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=3596)|
| 0:59:59| And this is something that needs some time to develop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=3599)|
| 1:00:03| And $35 million in relation to the full amount of the school budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=3603)|
| 1:00:09| seems very reasonable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=3609)|
| 1:00:12| And as we've gathered, you know, a lot of people can't make it here at 2 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=3612)|
| 1:00:16| So we're here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=3616)|
| 1:00:17| That's our job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=3617)|
| 1:00:18| That's my job as league president is to represent people who cannot be here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=3618)|
| 1:00:24| and cannot take off at 2 o'clock to be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=3624)|
| 1:00:28| And I know that you've been receiving messages that we've been encouraging people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=3628)|
| 1:00:33| We're encouraging people to be active and be informed and to communicate with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=3633)|
| 1:00:39| And we're going to continue to do that through this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=3639)|
| 1:00:49| But I want to say that the bottom line is that if we don't invest in our kids,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=3649)|
| 1:00:56| like the counties that surround us, like counties in the rest of the state,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=3656)|
| 1:01:04| we are not going to see improvement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=3664)|
| 1:01:08| And our kids deserve that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=3668)|
| 1:01:15| And we thank you for considering all the very difficult issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=3675)|
| 1:01:24| And we do want you to ask for accountability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=3684)|
| 1:01:28| And the league expects accountability as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=3688)|
| 1:01:31| And we'd like to see an annual report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=3691)|
| 1:01:34| We'd like to keep up with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=3694)|
| 1:01:36| That's our job too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=3696)|
| 1:01:38| We watch DOG.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=3698)|
| 1:01:39| And we will be there to watch DOG all the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=3699)|
| 1:01:44| You see us all the time, and we'll be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=3704)|
| 1:01:47| And we encourage more information to come out about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=3707)|
| 1:01:51| But that is no reason to say that we should not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=3711)|
| 1:01:54| I mean, the bottom line is we should invest in our kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=3714)|
| 1:01:57| They deserve it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=3717)|
| 1:01:59| And our community deserves it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=3719)|
| 1:02:01| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=3721)|
| 1:02:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=3722)|
| 1:02:04| Ann Barber.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=3724)|
| 1:02:10| If you would give us your address for the record,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=3730)|
| 1:02:12| and you'll have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=3732)|
| 1:02:14| Ann Barber, 2010 Amoral End Boulevard, E-M-O-R-I-L-A-N-D,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=3734)|
| 1:02:19| Boulevard 37917.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=3739)|
| 1:02:22| Despite buy-in from a diverse section of the local community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=3742)|
| 1:02:28| some people are trying to turn the Knox County School Board's budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=3748)|
| 1:02:32| into a political catchphrase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=3752)|
| 1:02:34| An example might be technology.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=3754)|
| 1:02:37| It's a complex component of the budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=3757)|
| 1:02:40| yet there are those who are making inflammatory statements claiming| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=3760)|
| 1:02:43| that technology simply means putting an iPad in every student's hands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=3763)|
| 1:02:49| And we all know they can't keep track of pencils.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=3769)|
| 1:02:51| How can we do an iPad?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=3771)|
| 1:02:54| These people are choosing not to look at the whole complex issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=3774)|
| 1:03:00| of technology.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=3780)|
| 1:03:03| A second issue that I wish to address is the mantra of jobs, jobs, jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=3783)|
| 1:03:10| Alas, we want high-paying, sustaining jobs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=3790)|
| 1:03:14| yet we refuse to provide a skilled workforce.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=3794)|
| 1:03:20| If I am a CEO of a company that intends to look at Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=3800)|
| 1:03:25| or East Tennessee to relocate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=3805)|
| 1:03:27| what message am I getting from a community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=3807)|
| 1:03:30| that's trying to do education on the cheap?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=3810)|
| 1:03:34| Take, for example, Ruby Tuesday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=3814)|
| 1:03:37| a strong presence originated in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=3817)|
| 1:03:41| The headquarters for Ruby Tuesday today is Blount County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=3821)|
| 1:03:46| Blount County is a county that places significantly more emphasis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=3826)|
| 1:03:50| on education than we appear to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=3830)|
| 1:03:53| I am a taxpayer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=3833)|
| 1:03:55| In fact, I get to pay two sets of property taxes for duplicate governments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=3835)|
| 1:04:01| I don't like paying taxes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=3841)|
| 1:04:03| but I am more than willing to see my property tax increased 0.35%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=3843)|
| 1:04:11| Now, to put that in a decimal, it is 0.0035.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=3851)|
| 1:04:16| There are a lot of zeros before you get to those numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=3856)|
| 1:04:20| Just to support our schools, I am a dues-paying member of KCEA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=3860)|
| 1:04:26| That's the Local Education Association,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=3866)|
| 1:04:29| and I support the school board's budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=3869)|
| 1:04:32| I strongly urge you to do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=3872)|
| 1:04:35| Finally, I work very hard at my job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=3875)|
| 1:04:39| 60-hour weeks are not, unfortunately, uncommon for me or for my colleagues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=3879)|
| 1:04:45| nor spending a lot of money out of my own pocket,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=3885)|
| 1:04:48| but the reason we work so hard for our students is for the children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=3888)|
| 1:04:54| I hope that you can be strong,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=3894)|
| 1:04:58| overcome obstacles that might be thrown in your path,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=3898)|
| 1:05:01| look in your hearts, vote for our students,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=3901)|
| 1:05:06| vote for our children, support this budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=3906)|
| 1:05:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=3910)|
| 1:05:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=3911)|
| 1:05:14| Next, we have Doug McAughan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=3914)|
| 1:05:19| I may have not gotten that last name correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=3919)|
| 1:05:21| M-C-C-A-U-G-H-A-N, Doug McAughan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=3921)|
| 1:05:27| Lance McCold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=3927)|
| 1:05:29| Is Lance McCold here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=3929)|
| 1:05:34| Yes, you'd give us your address, and you'll have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=3934)|
| 1:05:39| Yes, I'm Lance McCold, 130 Cogdell Road, 37922.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=3939)|
| 1:05:45| I want to speak about the school budget, of course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=3945)|
| 1:05:49| I heard a rumor that Mayor Burchard has threatened you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=3949)|
| 1:05:54| or many of you commissioners with ruin of your political career| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=3954)|
| 1:06:00| if you vote for the school budget requested by the county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=3960)|
| 1:06:07| I find it very difficult to believe this rumor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=3967)|
| 1:06:09| but it did get me thinking of sort of the political question you people face| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=3969)|
| 1:06:16| because we all know that there's a strong no new taxes philosophy amongst many,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=3976)|
| 1:06:24| and also, on the other hand, you have been hearing for months now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=3984)|
| 1:06:29| from people who say, raise my taxes, I care about my community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=3989)|
| 1:06:33| I care about the schools, and I want to see you raise the taxes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=3993)|
| 1:06:38| so that we can do better for our students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=3998)|
| 1:06:42| So what are you supposed to do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=4002)|
| 1:06:45| You're set between conflicting perspectives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=4005)|
| 1:06:50| So I was thinking about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=4010)|
| 1:06:51| Well, so why would you become a county commissioner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=4011)|
| 1:06:54| A county commissioner is not such a great job in a way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=4014)|
| 1:06:59| I mean, you don't get paid anything much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=4019)|
| 1:07:02| You've got everybody yelling at you most of the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=4022)|
| 1:07:04| It's a lot of work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=4024)|
| 1:07:05| So why would you do this except for maybe you really cared about our community?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=4025)|
| 1:07:12| I hope that's the reason people do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=4032)|
| 1:07:15| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=4035)|
| 1:07:16| But on the other hand, you could very well think, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=4036)|
| 1:07:18| this would be a stepping stone to being the mayor or, you know, our congressman or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=4038)|
| 1:07:27| Some people have different reasons,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=4047)|
| 1:07:28| but I'm sure that very much at the heart of this is that you chose to serve our community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=4048)|
| 1:07:35| on the county commission because you care about our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=4055)|
| 1:07:40| Now, you know, knowing that you face certain people who will not care about anything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=4060)|
| 1:07:49| except for if you raise their taxes, you have a very difficult situation to face.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=4069)|
| 1:07:55| You have, on one hand, people who care about the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=4075)|
| 1:07:58| and are working very hard to convince the community and you as our commissioners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=4078)|
| 1:08:03| to support what's good for the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=4083)|
| 1:08:05| On the other hand, you have people who, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=4085)|
| 1:08:08| seem mostly to care about what's in it for them, but they may be pretty important politically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=4088)|
| 1:08:14| So you're faced with deciding, am I going to do what may be politically expedient| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=4094)|
| 1:08:19| but really doesn't serve the reason I went into public service,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=4099)|
| 1:08:23| or am I going to stand for integrity for serving the reason I made the personal sacrifice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=4103)|
| 1:08:33| of becoming a county commissioner and do the right thing for our community?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=4113)|
| 1:08:38| Well, I hope you'll do the right thing for our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=4118)|
| 1:08:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=4120)|
| 1:08:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=4122)|
| 1:08:45| Next we have Mr. John Butler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=4125)|
| 1:08:49| Mr. Butler, if you could give us your address for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=4129)|
| 1:08:52| And you have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=4132)|
| 1:08:54| I'm Reverend Dr. John A. Butler, 4111 Landon Drive, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37921.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=4134)|
| 1:09:03| I'm also the pastor of Clinton Chapel A.M. Zion Church| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=4143)|
| 1:09:07| and the presiding elder of the Knoxville District A.M. Zion Church,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=4147)|
| 1:09:11| which we have nine churches I oversee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=4151)|
| 1:09:14| I'm also president-elect of KICMA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=4154)|
| 1:09:17| Knoxville Interdenominational Christian Ministerial Alliance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=4157)|
| 1:09:20| which we have members here today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=4160)|
| 1:09:23| and also past president of the Austin East Magnet School PTSO.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=4163)|
| 1:09:29| I'm also a proud parent of the valedictorian of Austin East this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=4169)|
| 1:09:38| He graduated with a 4.2,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=4178)|
| 1:09:41| and he's going to the University of Pennsylvania Wharton School of Business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=4181)|
| 1:09:46| He's our last child.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=4186)|
| 1:09:48| Hallelujah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=4188)|
| 1:09:51| And so we, unless there's a miracle of God,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=4191)|
| 1:09:55| my wife and I will not put any more students through the Knox County public school system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=4195)|
| 1:10:01| but we are much appreciative of the school system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=4201)|
| 1:10:05| I am here in support of the budget that has been presented by the Knox County School Board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=4205)|
| 1:10:14| and the superintendent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=4214)|
| 1:10:16| At KICMA, we have a resolution coming to you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=4216)|
| 1:10:21| and also have come to make a public statement that KICMA fully supports the superintendent's budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=4221)|
| 1:10:30| We had a vote at the PTSO meeting, the last meeting that I was the president of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=4230)|
| 1:10:36| and we took a vote to support the superintendent's budget that was presented| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=4236)|
| 1:10:41| and approved by the school board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=4241)|
| 1:10:44| And as a parent, I know that Austin East has come a long way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=4244)|
| 1:10:50| have gotten off the state list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=4250)|
| 1:10:52| A lot of federal, state, and county dollars were spent among, not just at Austin East,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=4252)|
| 1:10:59| but among a number of other schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=4259)|
| 1:11:02| Our church has an after-school program in which we serve for about three hours a day, five days a week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=4262)|
| 1:11:10| primarily students from Maynard School, but as well as Bearden Middle School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=4270)|
| 1:11:16| And we know that our students are in need of much more than what had been asked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=4276)|
| 1:11:24| I really believe the budget that has been requested, it's going to maintain the efforts that have already been made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=4284)|
| 1:11:31| If the budget is not passed, it's going to hurt the improvements, the efforts that have been made up to this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=4291)|
| 1:11:39| So this is not, even though it's an increase in dollars, I don't think it's going to be an increase in effort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=4299)|
| 1:11:45| I think it's really going to take us to the level that we've initially been trying to reach in the first place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=4305)|
| 1:11:52| We're not, just because I'm through as a parent in Knox County Schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=4312)|
| 1:11:58| doesn't mean that we're through as community leaders and community, being involved in the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=4318)|
| 1:12:05| I really believe that this is something that needs to be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=4325)|
| 1:12:10| I know the difficulty facing this commission because of the difficult decisions that you have to make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=4330)|
| 1:12:20| But if there's a choice between uneducated students,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=4340)|
| 1:12:24| and I really believe if the school does not get the dollars it needs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=4344)|
| 1:12:28| there are going to be some tough decisions that the school board would have to make,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=4348)|
| 1:12:32| decisions that they did not make prior to now because they wanted to ask the commission for more funds to do what needed to be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=4352)|
| 1:12:39| I really believe it's going to make a difference in our school system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=4359)|
| 1:12:44| I heard someone say recently that those that you don't educate, years later you may adjudicate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=4364)|
| 1:12:52| So it makes a difference if you have educated folk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=4372)|
| 1:12:56| I'm going to stop. Time's almost up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=4376)|
| 1:12:59| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=4379)|
| 1:13:04| Next we have Garrett Holt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=4384)|
| 1:13:10| Mr. Holt, if you would give us your address for the record, please, and you will have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=4390)|
| 1:13:15| Thank you. My name is Garrett Holt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=4395)|
| 1:13:17| I live at 2217 Delta Way, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37919.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=4397)|
| 1:13:23| I'm coming here because, you know, a lot of times in the government system when we talk about education,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=4403)|
| 1:13:28| I feel like there's not a lot of students at the policy table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=4408)|
| 1:13:32| And I'm here today to support the school budget proposed by Dr. McIntyre and the Knox County School Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=4412)|
| 1:13:38| A little background about myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=4418)|
| 1:13:40| I've been in Knox County's education system for the past 13 years, having attended Rocky Hill, Sequoia, Bearden Middle,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=4420)|
| 1:13:47| and most recently West High School, where I graduated this past Saturday as valedictorian.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=4427)|
| 1:13:57| Now, I'm here because over the past few years I really have, in myself, had a vested interest in what the education system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=4437)|
| 1:14:06| and the state of it is in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=4446)|
| 1:14:08| And when I first heard about the proposed $35 million budget increase by the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=4448)|
| 1:14:13| I was really skeptical of it just simply because of the large number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=4453)|
| 1:14:18| And I believe that's why a lot of the citizens of our county are skeptical as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=4458)|
| 1:14:23| However, I'm here to tell you today that, having just gone through the entire system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=4463)|
| 1:14:27| is that education is not something that we can skimp upon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=4467)|
| 1:14:30| It is not the area that government can lack in funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=4470)|
| 1:14:34| And when you put money into education, you're investing not just in the student,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=4474)|
| 1:14:39| you're investing in the future of both our community and the competitive nature that these students offer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=4479)|
| 1:14:45| in both the college and the future job market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=4485)|
| 1:14:47| Now, I spent this past weekend and a few hours researching exactly what this proposal contains| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=4487)|
| 1:14:52| and all the documents put forth by Dr. McIntyre and the school board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=4492)|
| 1:14:57| And after reading through this, and to use a quote Dr. McIntyre said, he said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=4497)|
| 1:15:03| we're not just asking for a bunch of money for you to trust us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=4503)|
| 1:15:06| They have a lot of research done, and they're putting money in critical areas where studies show| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=4506)|
| 1:15:12| improvements in student performance and academic achievement are going to be made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=4512)|
| 1:15:17| The other thing I wanted to say is that to anyone that's skeptical,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=4517)|
| 1:15:21| there's a certain trust we put in our public officials when we elect them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=4521)|
| 1:15:26| including the school board and their election, Dr. McIntyre, superintendent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=4526)|
| 1:15:31| I personally believe in the research they've done and the work they've put forth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=4531)|
| 1:15:36| in proposing this budget increase and the improvements that it's going to make in our educational system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=4536)|
| 1:15:42| You know, when we look at comparison to surrounding counties and the research that was done in that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=4542)|
| 1:15:47| and the spending they spend per student, you know, a lot of people have brought up Oak Ridge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=4547)|
| 1:15:52| and Blount County and the amount they spend more than Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=4552)|
| 1:15:56| as well as the average teacher salary being higher in those areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=4556)|
| 1:16:03| You know, I've definitely seen firsthand the effects that that's had in just my short time in the education system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=4563)|
| 1:16:10| At West High School this past few years, we've lost teachers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=4570)|
| 1:16:13| not just because of other counties offering better offers and teaching positions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=4573)|
| 1:16:19| We've also lost critical positions just due to cuts in funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=4579)|
| 1:16:23| And after reviewing some of the proposals in this plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=4583)|
| 1:16:28| this budget increase is going to provide financial assistance to areas that really need it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=4588)|
| 1:16:33| To all the magnet schools, it's providing an extra teacher position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=4593)|
| 1:16:36| We're adding full day kindergarten and a wide array of other topics that, you know, hands down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=4596)|
| 1:16:44| it's going to improve the education system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=4604)|
| 1:16:46| It's going to improve our community and it's going to improve the lives of our students in this county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=4606)|
| 1:16:51| So from a student speaking to a bunch of adults, having just gone through the system myself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=4611)|
| 1:16:57| I recommend the commission use their best judgment in this review of this budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=4617)|
| 1:17:04| And I hope that you make a decision that puts the interest of the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=4624)|
| 1:17:10| You've heard many people speak today about the desire to enact this budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=4630)|
| 1:17:15| And I think the feeling of most of the citizens of this county is the same, is that we can't leave the children behind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=4635)|
| 1:17:23| The simple fact of the matter is that students need to be a first priority of where we spend our money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=4643)|
| 1:17:30| Thank you for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=4650)|
| 1:17:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=4654)|
| 1:17:35| Next, Reverend Middlebrook.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=4655)|
| 1:17:38| If you would give us your address for the record, please, sir, and you'll have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=4658)|
| 1:17:43| Harold Middlebrook, 2334 Dandridge Avenue, Knoxville, 37915.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=4663)|
| 1:17:51| Mr. Chairman, members of the commission, perhaps I come, I've watched all of these young folk,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=4671)|
| 1:17:59| but I've been a pastor in this community for 35 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=4679)|
| 1:18:04| I seldom come before the commission to talk about anything, but this issue is a burning issue within me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=4684)|
| 1:18:14| I've had three children who have gone through this system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=4694)|
| 1:18:19| I've had a granddaughter to go through the system, a grandson now enrolled, and a great-grandson on the way to the system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=4699)|
| 1:18:29| And so I'm concerned that Knoxville will have one of the best, and Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=4709)|
| 1:18:36| will have one of the best systems of education to provide for our young people both now and in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=4716)|
| 1:18:47| I'm one of those who, like a lot of folk, are kind of conservative about my money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=4727)|
| 1:18:54| And so when you start talking ordinarily about tax increase, I start asking where are my taxes going?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=4734)|
| 1:19:04| I've come before this commission today to say that I am convinced that we need to provide the kind of system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=4744)|
| 1:19:14| that is first class for our young people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=4754)|
| 1:19:19| And I'm one of those who believe that I'm willing to pay for what I get.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=4759)|
| 1:19:27| Poor pay, poor preaching, poor pay, poor education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=4767)|
| 1:19:34| But if we invest now, then I am convinced the future will be bright not only for us now, but for the children to come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=4774)|
| 1:19:48| An old African proverb still holds true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=4788)|
| 1:19:52| It takes a whole village to raise a child.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=4792)|
| 1:19:58| And so I am saying to you, while others might criticize,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=4798)|
| 1:20:04| I do not propose to get into the whole political arena of whether positions are at stake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=4804)|
| 1:20:12| But I am one who believes that I vote for people who see a need and who are bold enough| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=4812)|
| 1:20:21| and brave enough to step up to the need and the plague, even when opposition might arise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=4821)|
| 1:20:29| I beg of you, I plead with you, pass the education budget not only for the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=4829)|
| 1:20:40| but for the future of our children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=4840)|
| 1:20:44| Thank you, and God bless you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=4844)|
| 1:20:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=4846)|
| 1:20:51| Next we have Stan Johnson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=4851)|
| 1:21:00| And if you would give us your address for the record, and you'll have up to five minutes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=4860)|
| 1:21:03| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=4863)|
| 1:21:04| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=4864)|
| 1:21:05| My name is Stan Johnson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=4865)|
| 1:21:06| I reside at 2805 Woodbine Avenue, Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=4866)|
| 1:21:10| I'm also the Executive Director of Socially Equal Energy Efficient Development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=4870)|
| 1:21:14| It stands for SEED.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=4874)|
| 1:21:16| I come to you guys to talk to you about on the flip side of the coin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=4876)|
| 1:21:21| When you were talking about education budget, I talked to you about kids that have to go get their GEDs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=4881)|
| 1:21:27| I also talked to you about kids that have to go through the prison system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=4887)|
| 1:21:30| I also talked to you about kids that are homeless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=4890)|
| 1:21:32| The kids that could have gotten that education based on what we're talking about here today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=4892)|
| 1:21:38| $35 million is nothing compared to how much it's going to take to prison some of these young people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=4898)|
| 1:21:44| that doesn't get education in the system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=4904)|
| 1:21:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=4907)|
| 1:21:50| We're here to talk about some of the homelessness that's in our community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=4910)|
| 1:21:53| and how those teenagers are starting to become more homeless when their parents kick them out of their homes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=4913)|
| 1:21:58| when they can't get an education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=4918)|
| 1:22:00| This is bigger than a budget, guys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=4920)|
| 1:22:03| This is our lives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=4923)|
| 1:22:05| This is our young people we're talking about, people that admire what you guys do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=4925)|
| 1:22:11| that one day want to sit in your same seats.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=4931)|
| 1:22:13| Well, without this education, you're not going to get there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=4933)|
| 1:22:17| I train inner city young people on how to get jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=4937)|
| 1:22:22| A lot of them come to me that can't even read at a ninth grade level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=4942)|
| 1:22:27| Well, that's the school system's job to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=4947)|
| 1:22:32| And without these additional funds, these young people are not going to see the need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=4952)|
| 1:22:37| If you guys aren't going to invest in them, why would they want to invest in you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=4957)|
| 1:22:41| Why should they go to school if you guys aren't going to put the money where the pavement hits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=4961)|
| 1:22:45| where the road hits them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=4965)|
| 1:22:49| You know, when we start looking at our communities and we start saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=4969)|
| 1:22:53| especially in the inner city or the project grad schools, what are we doing these programs for?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=4973)|
| 1:23:00| If we're going to be outside of the school system having to chip in to do things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=4980)|
| 1:23:04| why wouldn't we expect you guys to do the same?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=4984)|
| 1:23:08| What are we afraid of?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=4988)|
| 1:23:10| We sat here and had a big dilemma.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=4990)|
| 1:23:12| We are someplace in the lower 40th in the nation, the school system, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=4992)|
| 1:23:18| We go out and get somebody that's one of the best in the country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=4998)|
| 1:23:23| He comes and gives a proposal to us of what to make ourselves better compared to what he's used to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=5003)|
| 1:23:30| And we say no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=5010)|
| 1:23:32| Well, what good is he?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=5012)|
| 1:23:35| If this doesn't go in, we might as well get rid of him because this doesn't make any sense for him to do all this work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=5015)|
| 1:23:39| to come to the table and tell us what we need to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=5019)|
| 1:23:42| And we say no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=5022)|
| 1:23:45| So to wrap all this stuff up, guys, please vote for this budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=5025)|
| 1:23:49| Please help us because there are other things at play here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=5029)|
| 1:23:54| I work on the flip side of this budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=5034)|
| 1:23:57| I ask you guys for help to help me with our kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=5037)|
| 1:24:01| So these are kids that haven't had nothing happen yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=5041)|
| 1:24:04| These are young people that's in school, want to do the right thing, want to be able to go through the process, get to college.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=5044)|
| 1:24:10| And we're saying no to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=5050)|
| 1:24:13| Think of the alternatives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=5053)|
| 1:24:14| That's all I wanted to talk to you about today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=5054)|
| 1:24:16| Again, thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=5056)|
| 1:24:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=5058)|
| 1:24:21| Did Dwayne Crager come in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=5061)|
| 1:24:27| Or Doug McAuffin?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=5067)|
| 1:24:31| I hope I got that correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=5071)|
| 1:24:32| Those are all of the people that I have who have signed up to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=5072)|
| 1:24:35| But was there someone else who wanted to address us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=5075)|
| 1:24:37| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=5077)|
| 1:24:38| If you'd like to come to the podium and give us your name and address for the record,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=5078)|
| 1:24:41| we'd be happy to hear from you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=5081)|
| 1:24:42| And you will have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=5082)|
| 1:24:48| I'm Lillian Mashburn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=5088)|
| 1:24:49| I live at 902 Ruffian Lane, 37923.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=5089)|
| 1:24:54| As a former teacher, 40-some years ago, worked the bulk of my career in economic development, higher education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=5094)|
| 1:25:04| I owned a small consulting firm and worked in the development of high technology companies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=5104)|
| 1:25:10| And one of the things that gets missed in a lot of this is the kids that don't go to college,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=5110)|
| 1:25:16| kids that need an education, technical schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=5116)|
| 1:25:21| But they've got to have something today that they didn't used to have to have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=5121)|
| 1:25:26| They need a lot of math skills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=5126)|
| 1:25:28| If you go into a manufacturing plant today, you don't see people piecing parts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=5128)|
| 1:25:34| You see people operating a robot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=5134)|
| 1:25:37| You see people operating a computer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=5137)|
| 1:25:40| People that need statistical process control.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=5140)|
| 1:25:44| That's very different from the way it used to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=5144)|
| 1:25:47| If we don't have kids who graduate who can do those things, what happened to shade tree mechanics?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=5147)|
| 1:25:55| When you take your car in today, the person working on it has to work on a computer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=5155)|
| 1:26:02| He has to know math.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=5162)|
| 1:26:04| So it's not the way it used to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=5164)|
| 1:26:07| And I hear a lot of talk, well, somebody can go become a plumber.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=5167)|
| 1:26:11| They can operate and do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=5171)|
| 1:26:13| They can do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=5173)|
| 1:26:14| But you can't do it today the way you used to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=5174)|
| 1:26:17| So think about that when you're voting on this budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=5177)|
| 1:26:21| It affects all students everywhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=5181)|
| 1:26:24| It's very, very important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=5184)|
| 1:26:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=5188)|
| 1:26:33| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=5193)|
| 1:26:34| If you would give us your name and address for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=5194)|
| 1:26:36| And you'll have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=5196)|
| 1:26:39| My name is John Bostet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=5199)|
| 1:26:40| I live at 7317 Westridge Drive, Knoxville, 37909.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=5200)|
| 1:26:45| I want to make two points real briefly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=5205)|
| 1:26:47| You heard me some weeks ago say to you, and I think it's even more the case now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=5207)|
| 1:26:52| this is a leadership moment for the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=5212)|
| 1:26:56| We're going to move forward or we're going to move back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=5216)|
| 1:26:58| This is the decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=5218)|
| 1:27:00| I understand that people talk to you about your parochial issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=5220)|
| 1:27:05| which I mean your neighborhood issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=5225)|
| 1:27:07| Are you going to get this or that in the budget for your neighborhood?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=5227)|
| 1:27:11| We're weighing that, as the gentleman previously said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=5231)|
| 1:27:13| we're weighing that against the county as a whole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=5233)|
| 1:27:16| Is this county going to go forward or is this county going to go back?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=5236)|
| 1:27:20| And you are the leaders selected to make that decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=5240)|
| 1:27:24| So is it going to be forward or back?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=5244)|
| 1:27:29| The second issue I want to speak to is accountability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=5249)|
| 1:27:32| I've heard people raise this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=5252)|
| 1:27:35| I think we all need to hold ourselves accountable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=5255)|
| 1:27:38| We need to hold ourselves accountable to review the extensive study that the school board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=5258)|
| 1:27:46| has provided us with about accountability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=5266)|
| 1:27:49| Accountability is built into this budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=5269)|
| 1:27:52| Accountability is built into this plan from beginning to end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=5272)|
| 1:27:57| Does anyone think that the Knoxville Chamber,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=5277)|
| 1:28:01| a body representing all the businesses in Knoxville, big and small,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=5281)|
| 1:28:04| does anybody think the Knoxville Chamber is going to ask folks to throw money at problems?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=5284)|
| 1:28:10| I don't think so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=5290)|
| 1:28:11| They're all about accountability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=5291)|
| 1:28:13| They're all about the bottom line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=5293)|
| 1:28:17| So accountability is built into this budget from start to finish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=5297)|
| 1:28:22| There is a report put out by the schools, return on investment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=5302)|
| 1:28:28| That specifically ties previous investments to results.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=5308)|
| 1:28:33| So we need to hold ourselves accountable to consider those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=5313)|
| 1:28:36| And the school board and the school office certainly holds themselves accountable for public monies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=5316)|
| 1:28:43| So I hope that we'll all be accountable to say I'm certainly accountable to say my kids are through school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=5323)|
| 1:28:50| All I am, I'm a homeowner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=5330)|
| 1:28:53| I'm willing to pay the taxes for the community to improve this community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=5333)|
| 1:28:58| And I hope that you will join me in supporting the school board budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=5338)|
| 1:29:02| Thanks very much for listening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=5342)|
| 1:29:04| Appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=5344)|
| 1:29:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=5345)|
| 1:29:09| Commissioners, just so we're all on the same page,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=5349)|
| 1:29:12| tomorrow at 5 o'clock we'll be meeting at Calhoun's on the River.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=5352)|
| 1:29:16| At that time we'll be meeting with the school board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=5356)|
| 1:29:18| That is our joint meeting, which we agreed to have during our retreat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=5358)|
| 1:29:21| This is going to be a roll-up-your-sleeves budget where we really want to delve into numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=5361)|
| 1:29:25| We are not scheduled to have any public forum tomorrow because we want to spend the time with the commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=5365)|
| 1:29:30| and the school board to really delve into these issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=5370)|
| 1:29:35| Of course, it is a public meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=5375)|
| 1:29:37| but in terms of a forum we are not scheduled to do that tomorrow because we want to spend the time of the commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=5377)|
| 1:29:43| and the school board really talking about this budget and really having an opportunity to answer questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=5383)|
| 1:29:48| Next Tuesday we will have our regular commission meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=5388)|
| 1:29:51| The budget is not on the agenda for next Tuesday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=5391)|
| 1:29:55| We are going to take public comment next Tuesday at our regular commission meeting as long as we have time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=5395)|
| 1:30:02| We are going to need to do our zonings at 5 o'clock instead of 6| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=5402)|
| 1:30:06| because we need to be out of this room to make way for city council because of the holiday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=5406)|
| 1:30:14| So, again, we will have zonings next Tuesday at 5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=5414)|
| 1:30:18| And if for whatever reason we need to move into a room behind us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=5418)|
| 1:30:22| generally is this room behind us available if we have to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=5422)|
| 1:30:26| Pardon?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=5426)|
| 1:30:28| We'll need to call and see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=5428)|
| 1:30:29| But I think we can probably, as you've seen, the agenda is probably going to be short.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=5429)|
| 1:30:32| We're not talking about the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=5432)|
| 1:30:33| We're not voting on the budget, but we will have time for public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=5433)|
| 1:30:36| Then on Wednesday, as it stands now, and we'll talk about that tomorrow, we're scheduled right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=5436)|
| 1:30:41| The mayor will need to issue the call for that meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=5441)|
| 1:30:44| but we're scheduled to meet on next Wednesday at 5 o'clock for the vote on the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=5444)|
| 1:30:50| Commissioner Burroughs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=5450)|
| 1:30:52| Yes, I wanted to say this Thursday at the time warp,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=5452)|
| 1:30:55| we're doing our usual commissioners, coffee and conversation, anybody who wants to come at 4 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=5455)|
| 1:31:05| And then Chris Caldwell is going to join us at 5 for anyone who has any last questions about the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=5465)|
| 1:31:11| It's also for any community members, any constituents who need more clarification| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=5471)|
| 1:31:17| or have questions on the budget for them to come and ask questions directly to Chris.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=5477)|
| 1:31:23| So I hope that I will be seeing some of you at the time warp Thursday at 4 o'clock,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=5483)|
| 1:31:30| and you're welcome to stay when Chris gets there at 5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=5490)|
| 1:31:33| And also I wanted to announce as a proud mama that Aiden is graduating from fifth grade today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=5493)|
| 1:31:42| Jolie tells me that the room next door is available until 7 next Tuesday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120521?start=5502)|
