| 0:05:45| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231016_202310?start=345)|
| 0:05:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231016_202310?start=346)|
| 0:05:47| This girl was new, and she was appointed, I think, just a couple of weeks before this incident happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231016_202310?start=347)|
| 0:05:55| Okay, because you know if it goes to a third term, third violation, that gets very, very serious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231016_202310?start=355)|
| 0:06:02| I know, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231016_202310?start=362)|
| 0:06:03| Does your employee also know that the driver's license, they don't even have to key in the date of birth if they just look at it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231016_202310?start=363)|
| 0:06:12| You know, the driver's license that you have looks like this, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231016_202310?start=372)|
| 0:06:17| But if someone's under the age, it's like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231016_202310?start=377)|
| 0:06:22| Yeah, it's vertical, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231016_202310?start=382)|
| 0:06:24| So they're aware of that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231016_202310?start=384)|
| 0:06:25| Yeah, they are aware of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231016_202310?start=385)|
| 0:06:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231016_202310?start=387)|
| 0:06:28| But I think sometimes they really don't care, and I take that responsibility because my peer system has the 3D scanner which scans the ID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231016_202310?start=388)|
| 0:06:41| But, I mean, I take that responsibility, but my cashier don't understand that, how serious this issue is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231016_202310?start=401)|
| 0:06:49| Well, and as you know, as the owner of the beer permit, that it's a privilege to sell beer in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231016_202310?start=409)|
| 0:06:56| It is not a right, so you can lose that privilege.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231016_202310?start=416)|
| 0:07:00| Yes, sir, I know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231016_202310?start=420)|
| 0:07:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231016_202310?start=421)|
| 0:07:04| Do we have any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231016_202310?start=424)|

| 0:07:30| and these are obviously the first two violations, but they are very close together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231016_202310?start=450)|
| 0:07:35| And I would reiterate what my colleague said about you understand the third violation is a very serious matter to this board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231016_202310?start=455)|

| 0:16:06| and it seemed to be the will of the committee to go ahead and look into this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231016_202310?start=966)|
| 0:16:11| We were specifically addressing the caveat that seems to occur with transfer of ownership from one person to another| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231016_202310?start=971)|
| 0:16:21| when they begin accumulating violations in an effort to be able to start the number over and avoid a suspension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231016_202310?start=981)|
| 0:16:34| I did have a discussion with Director Moyers about this and how to proceed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231016_202310?start=994)|

| 0:16:45| you felt like under our charter that this Brewer Board could present a change in the rules that would satisfy our concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231016_202310?start=1005)|

| 0:17:31| so that it's an appropriate ordinance that we could bring for our rule changes for Brewer Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231016_202310?start=1051)|

| 0:17:41| Do we have any discussion before the motion and the second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231016_202310?start=1061)|
| 0:17:45| I think Commissioner Jay, possibly. There you go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231016_202310?start=1065)|
| 0:17:50| Something's beeping at me. Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231016_202310?start=1070)|
| 0:17:53| Have we discussed the time period in which, I mean, I think the goal of this is Bob Smith gets his third violation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231016_202310?start=1073)|
| 0:18:04| and then he basically transferred the business to Linda Smith and she takes over and keeps on going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231016_202310?start=1084)|
| 0:18:11| and it obviously is still a place that violates Beer Board laws and we're trying to sort of close that loophole,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231016_202310?start=1091)|
| 0:18:19| but have we talked about the time period?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231016_202310?start=1099)|
| 0:18:21| Is that once you've hit your third or fourth or it's been revoked, that establishment loses it for a year, six months?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231016_202310?start=1101)|
| 0:18:31| I mean, is there a time period in which a family member, let's say Bob Smith, screws it up and he can't sell beer for a year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231016_202310?start=1111)|
| 0:18:38| and decides not to be in the business, maybe a year later, you know, a son or daughter decides to pick it up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231016_202310?start=1118)|
| 0:18:43| Have we talked about that timeline yet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231016_202310?start=1123)|
| 0:18:46| Well, under the ordinance, if a beer license is revoked, no beer could be sold on the location for a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231016_202310?start=1126)|
| 0:18:53| That's the punitive period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231016_202310?start=1133)|
| 0:18:55| I would not think it would be, I mean, my personal feeling would be if after a year, Bob Smith's wife wants to open up a place there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231016_202310?start=1135)|
| 0:19:06| that shouldn't be a problem because there's not been anything there for a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231016_202310?start=1146)|
| 0:19:10| Bob Smith himself would not be prohibited after a year of trying to get a new license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231016_202310?start=1150)|
| 0:19:17| That would be allowable under the rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231016_202310?start=1157)|
| 0:19:20| So the big punishment, if you revoke, is that no beer can be sold in that location for a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231016_202310?start=1160)|
| 0:19:26| That's enough to put most places that rely on beer sales out of business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231016_202310?start=1166)|
| 0:19:31| Okay, so help me understand, what's the loop we're trying to close?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231016_202310?start=1171)|
| 0:19:37| Sometimes we'll see, if I may, a request for when they get to their second or their third violation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231016_202310?start=1177)|
| 0:19:49| and they know that next time there's going to be a revocation, then they sell it or they transfer ownership to another family member| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231016_202310?start=1189)|
| 0:20:02| so their number goes back to zero again at the same location with essentially the same management and leadership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231016_202310?start=1202)|
| 0:20:13| Okay, and so you, Director Moyers, you think there's a way to, I'm trying to figure out how do we word that in a way that doesn't,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231016_202310?start=1213)|
| 0:20:22| you're putting a scarlet letter on the property regardless of who owns it essentially.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231016_202310?start=1222)|
| 0:20:27| Yes and no. There's some language in the state statutes, and they may be in our Ordinance, I need to take a look,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231016_202310?start=1227)|
| 0:20:34| that does address this, not directly, but it talks about failing to transfer or transfers to family members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231016_202310?start=1234)|
| 0:20:42| who could take under the laws of intestacy. That's how the state has decided to make this definition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231016_202310?start=1242)|
| 0:20:49| You could still probably sell to your third cousin twice removed, but not your son, your wife, your father, that sort of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231016_202310?start=1249)|
| 0:20:57| So that may be something that we need to add to our line of questioning if we do get a sale or a transfer of license or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231016_202310?start=1257)|
| 0:21:05| I think the way I would conceive of it is that no beer license could be transferred to a family member, however defined,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231016_202310?start=1265)|
| 0:21:13| while there is a pending violation. I think that would take care of the issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231016_202310?start=1273)|
| 0:21:21| Or you could say while there's one pending or after three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231016_202310?start=1281)|
| 0:21:27| This Board, I think on three violations, still usually, unless it's particularly egregious, offers the finer suspension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231016_202310?start=1287)|
| 0:21:37| Revocations, I haven't seen generally unless there's four or more, in most cases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231016_202310?start=1297)|
| 0:21:42| So we can word it to say, you know, after three, you can't transfer to a family member.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231016_202310?start=1302)|
| 0:21:48| If there's a violation pending, you can't transfer to a family member.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231016_202310?start=1308)|
| 0:21:52| We can work on those things and try to come up with something that's not overly punitive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231016_202310?start=1312)|
| 0:21:56| but does accomplish what the Board is trying to accomplish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231016_202310?start=1316)|
| 0:21:59| All right. Thank you for the clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231016_202310?start=1319)|
| 0:22:01| Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231016_202310?start=1321)|
| 0:22:03| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231016_202310?start=1323)|
| 0:22:04| I think if I remember correctly, Vice Chair Hill, you're thinking of something that happened about two years ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231016_202310?start=1324)|
| 0:22:14| where the father had his third beer sales, and then we gave him a 90-day, he couldn't sell anything for 90 days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231016_202310?start=1334)|
| 0:22:30| and then he tried to transfer the business 30 days later during the 90-day period to his daughter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231016_202310?start=1350)|
| 0:22:38| And the Sheriff's Office caught that and told us what was going on, and so we didn't allow that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231016_202310?start=1358)|
| 0:22:44| But we probably do need to have that in writing so somebody who's under a 90-day suspension| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231016_202310?start=1364)|
| 0:22:51| can't just turn it over to a family member or somebody else and then, hey, I'm a new business now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231016_202310?start=1371)|
| 0:22:57| while it's still going through the process of...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231016_202310?start=1377)|
| 0:23:01| And I would actually like to catch it even before the suspension, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231016_202310?start=1381)|
| 0:23:07| And I have – I think we've all kind of felt a time or two where that was probably going to be in the works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231016_202310?start=1387)|
| 0:23:17| So I just – if there's just some way that we can just stop this, we just, yeah, need to close this loophole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231016_202310?start=1397)|
| 0:23:27| Is there any other discussions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231016_202310?start=1407)|
| 0:23:29| Commissioner Lee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231016_202310?start=1409)|
| 0:23:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231016_202310?start=1418)|
| 0:23:39| When you said, Mr. Law Director, when you said family member, would that also include ex-spouses?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231016_202310?start=1419)|
| 0:23:46| Because I think we had a situation a few months ago with an ex-spouse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231016_202310?start=1426)|
| 0:23:51| Not under the definition that's used by the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231016_202310?start=1431)|
| 0:23:56| Gosh, that would be a wild situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231016_202310?start=1436)|
| 0:23:59| Can we put that language in there that it would, you know, in that situation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231016_202310?start=1439)|
| 0:24:05| I believe there was an ex-spouse that was in here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231016_202310?start=1445)|
| 0:24:08| I mean, we can work on the definition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231016_202310?start=1448)|
| 0:24:12| As I stated, the state says persons who could take under – in an estate under the rules of intestacy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231016_202310?start=1452)|
| 0:24:21| Those rules don't include ex-spouses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231016_202310?start=1461)|
| 0:24:23| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231016_202310?start=1463)|
| 0:24:24| But we could add that to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231016_202310?start=1464)|
| 0:24:26| Can we add that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231016_202310?start=1466)|
| 0:24:27| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231016_202310?start=1467)|
| 0:24:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231016_202310?start=1468)|
| 0:24:30| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231016_202310?start=1470)|
| 0:24:32| So, I hear before Commissioner Lee – or Hill gives your motion, Director Moyers will be doing some research| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231016_202310?start=1472)|
| 0:24:42| and putting together this, and obviously it will come back in front of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231016_202310?start=1482)|
| 0:24:47| Yeah, well, there's a motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231016_202310?start=1487)|
| 0:24:51| I have to wait for this thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231016_202310?start=1491)|
| 0:24:52| Yeah, it would need to be an amendment to our Bureau ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231016_202310?start=1492)|
| 0:24:55| so it would have to go before the full county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231016_202310?start=1495)|
| 0:24:58| So, if you pass this and then Commissioner Hill wants to make it, put it on for November as a first reading,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231016_202310?start=1498)|
| 0:25:06| we'll have something drafted up for you by then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231016_202310?start=1506)|
| 0:25:11| Commissioner Hill, it's in your court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231016_202310?start=1511)|
| 0:25:14| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231016_202310?start=1514)|
| 0:25:15| I believe I understood that we needed a motion to have you go ahead and draft this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231016_202310?start=1515)|
| 0:25:22| to bring back to us for consideration and a vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231016_202310?start=1522)|
| 0:25:30| There's a motion on the floor by Commissioner Hill, a second by Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231016_202310?start=1530)|
| 0:25:35| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231016_202310?start=1535)|
| 0:25:37| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231016_202310?start=1537)|
| 0:25:38| All opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231016_202310?start=1538)|
| 0:25:39| None.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231016_202310?start=1539)|
| 0:25:40| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231016_202310?start=1540)|
| 0:25:41| If there's no more business to come in front of Knox County Beer Board, I'd like to have a motion for adjournment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231016_202310?start=1541)|
| 0:25:49| Motion by Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231016_202310?start=1549)|
| 0:25:51| Second by Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231016_202310?start=1551)|
| 0:25:54| And we are adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-beer-board-231016_202310?start=1554)|
