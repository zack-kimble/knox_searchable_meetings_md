| 0:08:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=515)|
| 0:08:36| Well, if this is – first of all, we have – we still have to pay our unfunded liability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=516)|
| 0:08:42| That's a – there's two different issues here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=522)|
| 0:08:44| One is, over the next 20 to 30 years, paying the unfunded liability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=524)|
| 0:08:48| The other is to make sure for future employees after January 1 – and, you know, we hire| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=528)|
| 0:08:53| – we have retirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=533)|
| 0:08:54| We hire employees all the time because of, you know, just the transitions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=534)|
| 0:08:58| And so future employees will have – you know, will be reduced costs to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=538)|
| 0:09:03| And so when we looked at version A of the plan, version B was even stricter, the ones that was finally passed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=543)|
| 0:09:13| But in version A of the plan, it was tens of millions of dollars in difference from the current plan to what the new plan would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=553)|
| 0:09:23| And you can't say exactly, because it all depends on what the markets are, what the return is on investment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=563)|
| 0:09:29| But in this case, the worse that the market does in the future, the more money this new plan saves, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=569)|
| 0:09:38| And so it definitely saves millions and millions of dollars in the future,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=578)|
| 0:09:42| but you can't say exactly how much because we don't know what the markets will do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=582)|
| 0:09:47| And I guess what I'm wondering, and I'm honored by that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=587)|
| 0:09:51| but before we get to your question, I think we've got a couple of questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=591)|
| 0:09:59| You've been working with security now, you've been teaching the incentive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=599)|
| 0:10:04| Do you have a sense of what would happen if it was fiscal?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=604)|
| 0:10:07| Well, obviously, we continue with a plan that's not sustainable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=607)|
| 0:10:13| I mean, it just wouldn't make any fiscal sense to not pass it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=613)|
| 0:10:17| So, I mean, we'll have to perhaps go back through the same tedious exercise that we did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=617)|
| 0:10:26| And I'm going to say this probably was the hardest issue that I've ever faced as a councilperson| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=626)|
| 0:10:32| and leading the meetings as the vice mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=632)|
| 0:10:36| You know, my hat goes off to the administration and the employee groups for the hard work that they did| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=636)|
| 0:10:42| because, I mean, Gene, you're in city government, and you know how big an issue this is to the employees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=642)|
| 0:10:46| as it should be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=646)|
| 0:10:47| So, I mean, it's something that this administration inherited,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=647)|
| 0:10:50| but it's something that this administration hit head-on and did a great job of doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=650)|
| 0:10:55| So, you know, I just really urge people to please support this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=655)|
| 0:11:00| I mean, this is, at a minimum, it's a first step.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=660)|
| 0:11:04| And, you know, if it has to be addressed again, so be it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=664)|
| 0:11:08| And a final question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=668)|
| 0:11:11| Is there any fear as far as the administration,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=671)|
| 0:11:15| with the hiring plan, why it's not going to be tied with qualified applicants?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=675)|
| 0:11:23| Well, you know, the new pension plan is not as good for employees as the current one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=683)|
| 0:11:29| So they are, the employees are giving up some future employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=689)|
| 0:11:34| As Vice Mayor Pavlis said, you know, the employee groups worked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=694)|
| 0:11:37| I'm very proud of the job they did, their representatives sitting around the table with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=697)|
| 0:11:41| Obviously, they don't want things to change for future employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=701)|
| 0:11:44| That will be their co-workers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=704)|
| 0:11:46| But they recognized that we had to make a change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=706)|
| 0:11:49| And so we think that, and I worked very closely with my police chief and fire chief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=709)|
| 0:11:54| And, you know, we spend $100,000 to recruit and equip and train an individual police officer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=714)|
| 0:12:03| We spend $50,000 to do the same for a firefighter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=723)|
| 0:12:06| And then we continue to train them year after year so their skills are sharp| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=726)|
| 0:12:10| and they're able to do the job that we expect of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=730)|
| 0:12:15| So that's one reason why I believe we still should have a hybrid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=735)|
| 0:12:18| They still need a base-defined benefit because they risk their life every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=738)|
| 0:12:23| And we cannot say, I wouldn't say to them as mayor, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=743)|
| 0:12:28| you risk your life every time you come to work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=748)|
| 0:12:31| When it gets ready to tire, hey, the risk is all on you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=751)|
| 0:12:33| You know, the taxpayers are not willing to have any risk on your retirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=753)|
| 0:12:37| I don't think that's fair, and I think that would hurt us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=757)|
| 0:12:40| So there are some people, there's a columnist or two who has suggested that we've not gone far enough,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=760)|
| 0:12:45| that we should have a defined contribution plan only,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=765)|
| 0:12:48| which means all of the risk is on the employee, you know, for whatever happens in the markets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=768)|
| 0:12:54| Not only do I think that is unfair to them, as I just mentioned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=774)|
| 0:12:59| but also we need police officers and firefighters to be able to retire| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=779)|
| 0:13:03| when they get to the age where they can no longer chase the bad guys| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=783)|
| 0:13:06| and they can't carry us out of the, you know, off the second floor down the ladder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=786)|
| 0:13:11| When they can't do the job, they need to be able to retire with dignity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=791)|
| 0:13:16| with a basic, the security of a basic benefit plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=796)|
| 0:13:21| And so it works in our favor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=801)|
| 0:13:23| And those who think we didn't go far enough do not have the responsibility that I do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=803)|
| 0:13:28| in making sure that not only that we spend taxpayer dollars very wisely| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=808)|
| 0:13:33| and that we reduce our future risk as much as we can,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=813)|
| 0:13:36| but I also have to make sure that future mayors are able to put together a police force| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=816)|
| 0:13:43| and a firefighter's department that can make sure that we're safe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=823)|
| 0:13:49| We're responsible for public safety and we're responsible for the pocketbook.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=829)|
| 0:13:54| And so we had to weigh, and the city council did a great job, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=834)|
| 0:13:58| of weighing those different needs and coming up with this plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=838)|
| 0:14:01| So we strongly urge people to support it so that we can begin to move in the right direction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=841)|
| 0:14:07| and at the same time protect our future employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=847)|
| 0:14:09| Gene, can I just follow up on one thing with that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=849)|
| 0:14:11| I mean, the age is 57 for the uniformed bodies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=851)|
| 0:14:15| I'm 57 years old.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=855)|
| 0:14:17| And so, you know, I know how I feel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=857)|
| 0:14:21| I'd have a hard time carrying you down a ladder from a burning building from the second floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=861)|
| 0:14:25| I mean, it would be time for me to move on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=865)|
| 0:14:28| But, unfortunately, if we went to the 401K, then that person, if the 401K was not performing, they stay on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=868)|
| 0:14:37| And perhaps somebody 73 years old, 75, whatever the age is, I mean, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=877)|
| 0:14:41| they just keep going because they can't retire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=881)|
| 0:14:43| So, I mean, it's just so important for this plan to pass because of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=883)|
| 0:14:50| And I want to urge people to be patient with the ballot because the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=890)|
| 0:14:55| what you want to vote for is at the very end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=895)|
| 0:14:58| So, please, be patient, be diligent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=898)|
| 0:15:00| It's a huge, important issue to the taxpayers and the future of our city and the employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=900)|
| 0:15:06| So go through the whole list of charter amendments and remember it at the end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=906)|
| 0:15:11| Right. You keep scrolling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=911)|
| 0:15:12| They're going to be, this wonderful body of folks up here are going to talk about the very first charter amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=912)|
| 0:15:18| for the county has to do with the sheriff's pension plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=918)|
| 0:15:21| The very last charter amendment is the city's, and that has to do with our pension plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=921)|
| 0:15:26| So there are two charter amendments dealing with pensions if you live in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=926)|
| 0:15:31| So, as Vice Mayor Pavlis said, keep going through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=931)|
| 0:15:34| Keep all the way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=934)|
| 0:15:35| Go through all seven county charter amendments, and then you get to the city charter amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=935)|
| 0:15:40| And we encourage you to vote for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=940)|
| 0:15:48| I think we have much better on page 12.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=948)|
| 0:15:50| We did not want the county to get the first one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=950)|
| 0:15:52| I think we need to do that again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=952)|
| 0:15:54| It's their back end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=954)|
| 0:15:55| It's the city code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=955)|
| 0:15:56| It's the address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=956)|
| 0:15:57| You need to vote for both the county and the city only.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=957)|
| 0:16:01| So, that's the goal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=961)|
| 0:16:02| I will call the county charter amendment for one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=962)|
| 0:16:07| So, our seven county charter amendments will be amended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=967)|
| 0:16:11| We want to propose to pass a beautiful mountain pension plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=971)|
| 0:16:14| We move this to the district of Section 733, 2015.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=974)|
| 0:16:18| And two, recognize county retirement and pension forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=978)|
| 0:16:21| We recognize for approval of five non-charter pensions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=981)|
| 0:16:25| a new beautiful mountain pension plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=985)|
| 0:16:27| We want to press this move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=987)|
| 0:16:29| Our county sheriff's department signed on to that in January 1, 2014.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=989)|
| 0:16:36| Well, right now, the sheriff's pension plan is costing a lot of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=996)|
| 0:16:47| money, just like the city pension plan is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=1007)|
| 0:16:50| And so, we took a look at it because the sheriff's pension| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=1010)|
| 0:16:55| plan is inside the county charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=1015)|
| 0:16:58| And the only way to change it now is with an amendment to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=1018)|
| 0:17:04| charter to either take it out or alter it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=1024)|
| 0:17:06| What this group decided to do was to give the option out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=1026)|
| 0:17:10| to go ahead and just close the pension plan the way it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=1030)|
| 0:17:13| currently is, take it out of the charter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=1033)|
| 0:17:16| and then allow the pension board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=1036)|
| 0:17:19| and then with the approval of the county commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=1039)|
| 0:17:22| to approve a new plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=1042)|
| 0:17:23| Right now, we're not recommending a new plan like the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=1043)|
| 0:17:26| city is, but what we're wanting to happen is for the pension| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=1046)|
| 0:17:30| board, working along with the county commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=1050)|
| 0:17:33| to come up with a new plan so that it's no longer that much| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=1053)|
| 0:17:35| cost to the county taxpayers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=1055)|
| 0:17:40| Mr. Briggs, is there a concern?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=1060)|
| 0:17:47| You heard what the city is doing in terms of closing theirs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=1067)|
| 0:17:51| and they're creating a hybrid,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=1071)|
| 0:17:53| and there's an alternative to the pension plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=1073)|
| 0:17:56| Is there a concern that the same issues that are facing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=1076)|
| 0:17:59| sheriff's deputies out there in the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=1079)|
| 0:18:02| about the plan and the way it works today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=1082)|
| 0:18:05| is there a concern that this thing is closed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=1085)|
| 0:18:09| There certainly is that concern,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=1089)|
| 0:18:11| and that was the consideration of this charter review committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=1091)|
| 0:18:15| and that will be the concern of the pension board and the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=1095)|
| 0:18:17| commission as we go forward on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=1097)|
| 0:18:19| What we really wanted to do with this amendment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=1099)|
| 0:18:22| if it passes, is to close the present plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=1102)|
| 0:18:25| which really appears as we go take this out to 2020,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=1105)|
| 0:18:29| or even to 2050, becomes unsustainable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=1109)|
| 0:18:32| and it becomes a burden that becomes unacceptable on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=1112)|
| 0:18:36| taxpayers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=1116)|
| 0:18:37| Yet, we recognize that the sheriff's deputies and the law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=1117)|
| 0:18:42| enforcement officers in the county do have a unique and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=1122)|
| 0:18:45| special position in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=1125)|
| 0:18:46| They are not like the other county employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=1126)|
| 0:18:49| Just as the mayor and vice mayor elucidated very clearly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=1129)|
| 0:18:54| these are individuals that we count on for our safety and our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=1134)|
| 0:18:57| public welfare.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=1137)|
| 0:18:59| What this amendment intends to do, though,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=1139)|
| 0:19:01| is to close the present uniformed officers pension plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=1141)|
| 0:19:05| Any officers that are enrolled in the plan now will have their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=1145)|
| 0:19:11| benefits and their survivors will potentially have those benefits until both of those people die.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=1151)|
| 0:19:17| Even the officers who come into the plan but yet are not vested in the plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=1157)|
| 0:19:22| as long as they have a total of five years' service by the time the new plan comes into effect on January 1, 2014.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=1162)|
| 0:19:32| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=1172)|
| 0:19:36| Right, that's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=1176)|
| 0:19:37| January 1, 2014, that those officers, as long as they have five years of continuous service from that point on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=1177)|
| 0:19:44| will be fully vested into the defined benefit plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=1184)|
| 0:19:48| What we wanted to do was to leave the flexibility to the pension board and the county commission to design a plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=1188)|
| 0:19:55| for the officers that come in after that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=1195)|
| 0:19:58| We would anticipate, even though that still is flexible enough to take any form,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=1198)|
| 0:20:04| that it would be an enhanced plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=1204)|
| 0:20:07| It would be developed by the pension board and then approved by the county commission for the new officers coming on board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=1207)|
| 0:20:13| after 2014.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=1213)|
| 0:20:16| Can I just sort of address that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=1216)|
| 0:20:18| Dr. Briggs talked about an enhanced plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=1218)|
| 0:20:21| And I think what he's doing is saying he's referencing enhanced compared to what the rest of the employees of Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=1221)|
| 0:20:27| are receiving, not enhanced compared to what the officers are getting right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=1227)|
| 0:20:31| I just want to make sure that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=1231)|
| 0:20:33| I think it's fair to say, well, this would be something we're leaving completely to the discretion of the pension board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=1233)|
| 0:20:38| and county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=1238)|
| 0:20:40| But I think what we would probably see there is that there is a recognition that the law enforcement officers are a special group| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=1240)|
| 0:20:48| that have a job that's different than the rest of the county employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=1248)|
| 0:20:53| Was there discussion of trying to have this plan within a charter question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=1253)|
| 0:21:00| Because we know in terms of what's in front of us that we would get high taxes on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=1260)|
| 0:21:08| Thank you, Gene.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=1268)|
| 0:21:10| I think of all of the issues that came before the charter committee that this was one of the most difficult ones because,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=1270)|
| 0:21:18| you know, our law enforcement officers are, you know, so critical to our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=1278)|
| 0:21:23| But on the other hand, I think that this was the one issue that I heard from the most people about because of the concern| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=1283)|
| 0:21:31| of how much it costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=1291)|
| 0:21:33| And so there was a lot of discussion about, you know, whether we should just do, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=1293)|
| 0:21:42| go ahead and say that we wanted to have a defined contribution plan instead of a defined benefit plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=1302)|
| 0:21:49| But what we actually did is our chairman put together a committee who met with the pension board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=1309)|
| 0:21:59| with the sheriff, with everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=1319)|
| 0:22:01| And Mr. Lindsey was actually on that, so he could probably address that more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=1321)|
| 0:22:06| But he basically, they basically, you know, decided that the best thing to do would be to let the experts put together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=1326)|
| 0:22:14| something, you know, and with the approval of county commission, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=1334)|
| 0:22:19| come up with something that would be fair to the taxpayers but also fair to our uniformed officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=1339)|
| 0:22:26| And one other point I'd really like to make, just in case anybody tuned in late or whatever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=1346)|
| 0:22:30| is that this would not affect any existing persons who are on the pension plan right now for this county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=1350)|
| 0:22:40| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=1360)|
| 0:22:41| When we, when that subcommittee was formed, we were tasked with a few things to look at this current plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=1361)|
| 0:22:47| as it is in the charter and to see what would be best for the county moving forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=1367)|
| 0:22:54| We did take into consideration the fact that the voters did vote to have this UOP,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=1374)|
| 0:22:59| to do something special for the uniformed officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=1379)|
| 0:23:04| And I think we had two things to look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=1384)|
| 0:23:06| One was to maintain the current wish of the voters,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=1386)|
| 0:23:10| but also to look at the financial responsibility, you know, of this plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=1390)|
| 0:23:14| and whether or not if it was best to be inside of the charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=1394)|
| 0:23:20| And basically, as we looked at this, we spoke with members of the Retirement and Pension Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=1400)|
| 0:23:26| They sat down with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=1406)|
| 0:23:27| And for about four weeks, we sat down and talked about these issues at hand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=1407)|
| 0:23:34| And what we determined was we still wanted to provide this benefit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=1414)|
| 0:23:38| but the voice of the Retirement and the Pension Board was they did not have the flexibility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=1418)|
| 0:23:44| to make any adjustments to this plan because it is inside the charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=1424)|
| 0:23:49| And it would compel them to do what was in the charter without being able to have any extra considerations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=1429)|
| 0:23:56| or have any ability to make those adjustments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=1436)|
| 0:23:59| So that's one reason why you see this amendment is because the committee recommended to the larger body| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=1439)|
| 0:24:06| that it be removed to provide the Retirement Board to have the flexibility to work with the commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=1446)|
| 0:24:13| and to put something together that would not only be a benefit to the officers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=1453)|
| 0:24:17| but also in the future to the taxpayers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=1457)|
| 0:24:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=1463)|
| 0:24:25| I guess it's Commissioner Leuthold who read this to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=1465)|
| 0:24:29| It seemed to me that we left the taxpayers out of the vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=1469)|
| 0:24:34| We voted the pension in, the original ones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=1474)|
| 0:24:37| But in this one, if you change it after this, it doesn't have any recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=1477)|
| 0:24:46| for it going to the community for a vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=1486)|
| 0:24:52| Well, I guess my response to that, ma'am, is that because like Mr. Lindsey| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=1492)|
| 0:24:57| and Briggs and Lisa Starbuck here have indicated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=1497)|
| 0:25:03| part of the problem we have is that the plan, the details of the plan are inside the charter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=1503)|
| 0:25:10| and there's no flexibility to be able to make some changes to take some of the financial burden off of the taxpayers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=1510)|
| 0:25:19| So by leaving it out of the charter, taking it out of the charter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=1519)|
| 0:25:23| it will allow the pension board along with the commission to come up with a new plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=1523)|
| 0:25:30| I have no idea what that plan will be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=1530)|
| 0:25:32| But because the commission is going to have the final word on that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=1532)|
| 0:25:36| then your representative that you elect will have that say so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=1536)|
| 0:25:41| So people will be represented through their legislators or county legislators.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=1541)|
| 0:25:47| Well, I see that as a distant way to be represented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=1547)|
| 0:25:53| But I would want you to look at that, this, when you do look at the new charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=1553)|
| 0:26:00| But I'm no longer a county commissioner, so I won't be making that decision, but Commissioner Briggs will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=1560)|
| 0:26:08| I really appreciate that question, because I think that's an excellent question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=1568)|
| 0:26:12| And I happen to sit on the pension board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=1572)|
| 0:26:14| and it's when we started looking at the problems we were running into with the additional tax money that was having to go in there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=1574)|
| 0:26:21| we found out that we could not change anything in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=1581)|
| 0:26:25| Not only did citizens not have an input, but the commission, the members of the pension board, we were handcuffed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=1585)|
| 0:26:32| And I think you're absolutely right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=1592)|
| 0:26:34| We need to have citizen input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=1594)|
| 0:26:36| We need to have other representative input into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=1596)|
| 0:26:39| By taking it out of the charter before the commission can approve any plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=1599)|
| 0:26:43| we'll have citizens just like you standing up there and say, I agree with this, I disagree with this, I think we should do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=1603)|
| 0:26:51| And that all goes into the deliberations that the county commission will have before they approve any final plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=1611)|
| 0:26:58| Also, as we go down the line, I don't know what's going to happen to the stock market in five or ten or 20 or 25 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=1618)|
| 0:27:04| but also this gives the pension board and the county commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=1624)|
| 0:27:07| if we run into another problem like we have with the economic crisis in the past four years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=1627)|
| 0:27:12| they have the flexibility to even change the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=1632)|
| 0:27:16| And citizens can come down there and say the burden is getting too much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=1636)|
| 0:27:19| The tax burden is too much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=1639)|
| 0:27:21| We need to do something different, and we can do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=1641)|
| 0:27:23| But if it's embedded in the charter, we can't do a thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=1643)|
| 0:27:27| Well, thank you for listening to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=1647)|
| 0:27:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=1650)|
| 0:27:36| Could you be more specific about what the problems were with the county plan that led to the conclusion that it was not financially stable?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=1656)|
| 0:27:51| As I recall, and correct me if I'm wrong, that there was a projection for what this plan would cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=1671)|
| 0:27:58| And as I recall, the projection for what this plan would cost was an underestimate, if I'm not mistaken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=1678)|
| 0:28:06| If you like, I'd address that, because I've been on the pension board, and I've sat through these same deliberations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=1686)|
| 0:28:12| There are certain things that the actuaries do when they predict how a fund will perform.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=1692)|
| 0:28:18| You know, for instance, we assumed that there would be a seven-and-a-half percent increase,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=1698)|
| 0:28:23| which was actually very conservative if you look at the last 25 years up until about 2008.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=1703)|
| 0:28:29| We assumed that inflation would be relatively stable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=1709)|
| 0:28:32| We made a lot of assumptions that really went out the window with the economic crisis that we've had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=1712)|
| 0:28:38| And it's the same problem that a lot of municipalities ran into.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=1718)|
| 0:28:43| The problem is that we couldn't change any of those things as we tried to adapt to a crisis that we haven't seen since the 1930s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=1723)|
| 0:28:52| And that particular was what led to this, is that the assumptions that were made historically going back to 1929| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=1732)|
| 0:29:02| and 1930 just didn't average out, and that burden became greater and greater.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=1742)|
| 0:29:07| And if I could also add to it, one of the assumptions was that the cost to the county was going to be right at 12% of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=1747)|
| 0:29:19| cost of the employee's salary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=1759)|
| 0:29:22| And right now, I believe, Dr. Briggs, it's about 15%, 16%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=1762)|
| 0:29:26| Yeah, it's more than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=1766)|
| 0:29:28| It's about 16% or 17%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=1768)|
| 0:29:29| It's going up to 19%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=1769)|
| 0:29:30| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=1770)|
| 0:29:31| And within the next few years, it's going to be at 19%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=1771)|
| 0:29:33| And I think if you project even further out, it was actually going to get up to closer to 34%, I believe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=1773)|
| 0:29:39| once you got about to year 2025.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=1779)|
| 0:29:43| And so because of the reason is once you start losing the kind of money that the county lost in the stock market for this plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=1783)|
| 0:29:55| you're already behind the eight ball.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=1795)|
| 0:29:57| And you're not making once your revenue is short and you can't make up that because when you, for instance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=1797)|
| 0:30:05| if you have $100 and you lose 10% and then the next year you get 10%, you're still behind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=1805)|
| 0:30:11| And you should have been not at 100 now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=1811)|
| 0:30:13| You should have been at 110 or 115.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=1813)|
| 0:30:17| And so your revenues will never catch up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=1817)|
| 0:30:21| And that's why we need to get a grip on this now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=1821)|
| 0:30:27| Thank you, Mr. Patterson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=1827)|
| 0:30:29| A comment and then a question, I guess, for Dr. Riggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=1829)|
| 0:30:32| When this was voted in, we were led to believe that it would be uniformed officers that had dealings with criminals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=1832)|
| 0:30:41| Of course, as time has gone on, people have been added to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=1841)|
| 0:30:44| So this next pension board and next county commission, we need to make sure that it's well-defined that who is involved in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=1844)|
| 0:30:51| And there may be, I'm not saying they're not, but there could be people on there that really shouldn't be on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=1851)|
| 0:30:56| That's what we voted on four years ago, five years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=1856)|
| 0:31:00| My question is, and this is a follow-up from the lady here, is I like to be able to vote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=1860)|
| 0:31:07| but I do have a commissioner in the 9th District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=1867)|
| 0:31:10| Is this going to be, Dr. Briggs, is this going to be a two-thirds majority vote on this pension plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=1870)|
| 0:31:15| Can you answer that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=1875)|
| 0:31:16| Or does anybody know that's in this new pension plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=1876)|
| 0:31:19| I know it's not on this one, but it does concern, you know, six votes is a lot different than eight votes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=1879)|
| 0:31:26| When it comes to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=1886)|
| 0:31:29| This amendment does not address how many votes it will take.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=1889)|
| 0:31:32| And generally on, and I think it would be fair to say, and Chairman Lutho was on the commission for a number of years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=1892)|
| 0:31:39| it will be a majority vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=1899)|
| 0:31:41| As far as I know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=1901)|
| 0:31:42| Now, obviously, if the commission at the time wishes to change their rules for this particular issue, they could do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=1902)|
| 0:31:52| But barring that, I think a simple majority would be all it would take.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=1912)|
| 0:31:58| Of course, you know, and that's one of the reasons that Dr. Briggs sort of started on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=1918)|
| 0:32:06| One of the reasons why that it's not going to go into place until 2014, January 1 of 2014,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=1926)|
| 0:32:14| is to give the pension board the time to work with all of the folks that will have an input into it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=1934)|
| 0:32:21| to come up with that plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=1941)|
| 0:32:22| It's going to be very, very important that there's input from the pension board, from employees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=1942)|
| 0:32:28| from the citizens, from the sheriff's department, the experts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=1948)|
| 0:32:34| so that the plan that comes forward is the best plan not only for the sheriff's deputies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=1954)|
| 0:32:40| but also for the citizens to make sure that they can afford it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=1960)|
| 0:32:44| Because I don't think that the citizens want to keep on having this issue coming before them again, again, and again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=1964)|
| 0:32:53| Let me just get an idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=1973)|
| 0:32:57| If each of the members of the research committee agrees that voters should support that plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=1977)|
| 0:33:04| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=1984)|
| 0:33:05| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=1985)|
| 0:33:07| Question number two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=1987)|
| 0:33:09| Section 9.17 of our county private charter has a term in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=1989)|
| 0:33:14| It mentions, one, clarifying that no person shall be eligible for the same elected office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=1994)|
| 0:33:20| not county employees, due to section 2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=2000)|
| 0:33:23| Two, providing a term for a full elected period as prescribed by law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=2003)|
| 0:33:28| Three, if that person is so limited as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=2008)|
| 0:33:31| it deserves a different elected office due to the particular term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=2011)|
| 0:33:37| Well, what this does is that what we currently have in our charter is very vague as far as the language,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=2017)|
| 0:33:44| as far as term limits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=2024)|
| 0:33:46| And it doesn't define exactly what counts as a term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=2026)|
| 0:33:52| Everybody thinks that they know what a term is, but the charter didn't spell it out very specifically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=2032)|
| 0:33:57| So it has opened up the county to possible lawsuits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=2037)|
| 0:34:01| And what we're trying to do simply is to clarify what we mean when we say two terms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=2041)|
| 0:34:07| And that's basically what we're trying to say with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=2047)|
| 0:34:10| So if they say, not that there's a commissioner to die on the second day of the term of office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=2050)|
| 0:34:17| but the commissioner appoints somebody on the third day, even though a couple of days is sort of a full term,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=2057)|
| 0:34:23| that's not the case?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=2063)|
| 0:34:25| No, and actually it couldn't be the next day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=2065)|
| 0:34:27| State law requires that there be at least a ten-day period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=2067)|
| 0:34:31| I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=2071)|
| 0:34:35| Let's say they don't have to die just for whatever reason it becomes vacated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=2075)|
| 0:34:40| I don't want Dr. Briggs to have any bad feelings on the way home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=2080)|
| 0:34:45| But the point being someone could serve a little over 11 years in a position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=2085)|
| 0:34:54| But in order to do that, though, Gene, is that first they'd have to be appointed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=2094)|
| 0:35:00| and then they'd have to win a special election to finish out the term, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=2100)|
| 0:35:06| And then they'd have to win two consecutive elections after that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=2106)|
| 0:35:10| So even for someone to serve that period of time, they would still have to win three elections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=2110)|
| 0:35:15| And so that's still putting that in the hands of the voters as far as elections are concerned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=2115)|
| 0:35:22| And then there is, I think there are some jurisdictions where you can serve a partial term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=2122)|
| 0:35:31| Well, we had considerable discussion about what constitutes a term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=2131)|
| 0:35:36| And we had to come to a consensus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=2136)|
| 0:35:39| In fact, I think what we did is we delayed making a vote on it because the members of the committee did not agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=2139)|
| 0:35:49| And we wanted to spend some time going out, talking with citizens, and getting that type of feedback.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=2149)|
| 0:35:58| And so there was not just a roll call and we all agreed that there was not a term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=2158)|
| 0:36:04| There was considerable discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=2164)|
| 0:36:07| And so at the end, in order to resolve it, we had to come to some consensus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=2167)|
| 0:36:13| And the consensus was that we had to define the term as any of the unserved portion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=2173)|
| 0:36:44| A member of the committee who has to pass a warrant is considered to stay in the election office for two terms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=2204)|
| 0:36:52| Well, I know Dr. Page down here had some words about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=2212)|
| 0:36:56| But let me just speak real quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=2216)|
| 0:36:59| The answer to the question is that the people voted for term limits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=2219)|
| 0:37:03| They expected people, when they said that, you vote, you get to stay in office for two terms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=2223)|
| 0:37:08| And what we're saying is, is that if someone serves as a district commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=2228)|
| 0:37:14| and then we also have commissioners that are at large or countywide,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=2234)|
| 0:37:19| then we're saying you can't go from that district, serve two terms there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=2239)|
| 0:37:24| and then turn around and run for an at-large and serve two terms there because the people have spoken that when they meant two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=2244)|
| 0:37:30| terms, they meant two terms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=2250)|
| 0:37:32| But one thing I did want to address, if I could just take a second, Gene, is that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=2252)|
| 0:37:36| and Phyllis brought that up, we established some ground rules when we were going through the charter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=2256)|
| 0:37:43| and that was that it would take two readings for anything to pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=2263)|
| 0:37:47| In fact, someone had to put it on the agenda, it had to be discussed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=2267)|
| 0:37:51| and then they had to agree to put it on first reading, and then it had to be passed there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=2271)|
| 0:37:56| and then put on second reading so that we couldn't simply have someone bring an item up, roll call vote, boom,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=2276)|
| 0:38:03| we've got something on the ballot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=2283)|
| 0:38:05| And that was something that I insisted on and the rest of the committee insisted on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=2285)|
| 0:38:12| that everything have a chance for the public to have their input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=2292)|
| 0:38:16| And then also, very important, was so that the law department would have time to research these proposals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=2296)|
| 0:38:25| to make sure that they were legally defensible and that they were written in a way that it would hold up in court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=2305)|
| 0:38:33| I wanted to ask you this question about how large the district is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=2313)|
| 0:38:37| Aren't those two separate constituencies?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=2317)|
| 0:38:39| You're a district, you're a community service, you speak to your district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=2319)|
| 0:38:43| but how large is the whole county and their budget?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=2323)|
| 0:38:46| Aren't those different?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=2326)|
| 0:38:47| Even though it looks like ducks, they quite like ducks, aren't they actually ducks?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=2327)|
| 0:38:53| So Chairman Leuthold probably pointed me out on this because I was in a minority vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=2333)|
| 0:38:58| I felt that same way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=2338)|
| 0:39:00| I felt that same way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=2340)|
| 0:39:01| And that, you know, but it illustrates, you know, the rules that Chairman Leuthold talked about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=2341)|
| 0:39:09| Folks should have a lot of confidence in what this committee did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=2349)|
| 0:39:12| We disagreed a lot and we disagreed very verbally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=2352)|
| 0:39:17| And maybe not many people were watching, but we had some good discussions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=2357)|
| 0:39:24| And so what we've put before you has not casually come about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=2364)|
| 0:39:30| And, you know, I support and I'm going to vote yes when I vote for this amendment because I think it's a good amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=2370)|
| 0:39:38| I disagree with some of the construct of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=2378)|
| 0:39:41| The at-large positions, in my view, are separate offices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=2381)|
| 0:39:45| And you can almost treat them as like a House of Representatives and a senator.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=2385)|
| 0:39:50| Where the at-large positions to me are where you try to bring in a more statesman-like approach to the commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=2390)|
| 0:39:57| where folks from the districts will tend to finish out their term limits and then step up to the at-large seats.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=2397)|
| 0:40:06| That's not going to happen with this amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=2406)|
| 0:40:09| But I think it's still a good amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=2409)|
| 0:40:11| You know, the consensus, as I said, I was in the minority on my position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=2411)|
| 0:40:17| And, you know, I think it's a good amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=2417)|
| 0:40:25| David and I sat beside each other for most of the discussion and we often disagreed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=2425)|
| 0:40:31| But we were very agreeable, weren't we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=2431)|
| 0:40:35| What I brought to the discussion was something that I had talked to several people about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=2435)|
| 0:40:44| And it seemed as if we were setting a platform for certain individuals to maneuver through the elected process to set them up for additional offices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=2444)|
| 0:40:59| Because if you serve as a commissioner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=2459)|
| 0:41:02| and I will say that when they're sitting around here it doesn't say at-large, it doesn't say 9th District, 4th District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=2462)|
| 0:41:10| It has everyone's name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=2470)|
| 0:41:12| And the perception from the public is that you are all the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=2472)|
| 0:41:17| And so my discussion and disagreement with what Dr. Page had said is if you are a representative at-large| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=2477)|
| 0:41:26| and you do, in fact, represent all of Knox County, then you are representing those that you represented before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=2486)|
| 0:41:39| While you were at it, why didn't you just make everybody make nine new districts again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=2499)|
| 0:41:46| Because that's what you're coming up with except the two people have to raise nine times as much money just to run all over the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=2506)|
| 0:41:55| Is that not correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=2515)|
| 0:41:58| I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=2518)|
| 0:42:00| I agree with you completely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=2520)|
| 0:42:01| And I wish we had nine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=2521)|
| 0:42:02| You're one of the at-large.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=2522)|
| 0:42:04| No, no, I don't like the at-large.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=2524)|
| 0:42:06| I wish we had nine districts and nine commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=2526)|
| 0:42:10| And I argued for that when we were talking about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=2530)|
| 0:42:14| There wasn't a very thorough discussion about whether the two at-large commissioners may not even be equal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=2534)|
| 0:42:22| There may be some reasons that could be challenged.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=2542)|
| 0:42:26| But I agree with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=2546)|
| 0:42:27| I think if we had nine districts and nine commissioners, that would be my personal preference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=2547)|
| 0:42:33| I do agree with this amendment because I believe very firmly in term limits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=2553)|
| 0:42:38| And what we what I think we're avoiding with this is what I call the merry-go-round.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=2558)|
| 0:42:43| And what you could conceivably see is someone served two terms as a district representative, two terms as at-large, two terms as a district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=2563)|
| 0:42:51| two terms as at-large, and I don't think that these should be seats for life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=2571)|
| 0:42:56| Ultimately, on the commission, each commissioner gets one vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=2576)|
| 0:42:59| I certainly agree with the term limits on everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=2579)|
| 0:43:02| But that was considered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=2582)|
| 0:43:05| That was considered when we did these deliberations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=2585)|
| 0:43:08| You don't think it would be an improvement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=2588)|
| 0:43:11| I thought it would, but the majority of other people didn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=2591)|
| 0:43:15| We discussed that as to getting really at-large and looking at an amendment for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=2595)|
| 0:43:21| It just was difficult to get any momentum for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=2601)|
| 0:43:24| But there just wasn't support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=2604)|
| 0:43:26| So it was discussed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=2606)|
| 0:43:28| I think, you know, it's something to look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=2608)|
| 0:43:30| But if you're going to have at-large seats, you know, they're here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=2610)|
| 0:43:33| We've got to deal with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=2613)|
| 0:43:35| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=2615)|
| 0:43:36| I think associated with that and kind of segue into there was a lot of discussion about, you know, changing the number of seats.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=2616)|
| 0:43:46| That was something that there were some people who thought that fewer commissioners would be a better idea| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=2626)|
| 0:43:53| and some people that said that more commissioners would be a better idea to have, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=2633)|
| 0:43:59| more community-oriented commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=2639)|
| 0:44:02| So, you know, those ideas were kind of related.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=2642)|
| 0:44:06| That sounds like you worked hard on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=2646)|
| 0:44:09| A lot of it didn't make it to the ballot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=2649)|
| 0:44:12| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=2652)|
| 0:44:37| Well, within the charter right now, it talks about now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=2677)|
| 0:44:42| the school board has got staggered terms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=2682)|
| 0:44:44| Half of them are at one cycle and then two years later the other half are elected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=2684)|
| 0:44:49| And right now, the ones that are elected the same time frame as the property assessor, they're tied to it in the charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=2689)|
| 0:44:59| And because the charter can change, there was even talk about making different offices appointed versus elected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=2699)|
| 0:45:08| It's kind of possible that you might have had a property assessor that was appointed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=2708)|
| 0:45:12| and so you wouldn't even have an elected assessor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=2712)|
| 0:45:15| In Shelby County, which has a charter, they actually staggered their property assessor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=2715)|
| 0:45:20| so that they're elected on a different four-year cycle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=2720)|
| 0:45:23| So it didn't make sense to continue to tie that election to the property assessor's election because that has a possibility of changing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=2723)|
| 0:45:35| And so state law was already going to prevail when those elections were going to occur.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=2735)|
| 0:45:40| And so we're just saying, you know what, we're just going to follow state law and tie it to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=2740)|
| 0:45:49| It won't change anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=2749)|
| 0:45:51| It just makes it clear within the charter we're going to follow state law instead of something that might change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=2751)|
| 0:46:01| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=2761)|
| 0:46:02| Question number five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=2762)|
| 0:46:04| Section 6.09A.4.3 of the County Charter be amended to clarify that school boards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=2764)|
| 0:46:10| and our County Commission should meet upon submission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=2770)|
| 0:46:13| So what does that mean?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=2773)|
| 0:46:14| Does that mean that we should be adopted by a commission or a school service in the absence of a public submission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=2774)|
| 0:46:22| Here again, we're going to follow state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=2782)|
| 0:46:28| The charter right now in that section says that the school board gets to decide their own district boundaries,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=2788)|
| 0:46:36| but that's not what state law says.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=2796)|
| 0:46:37| So we're just changing our charter to follow state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=2797)|
| 0:46:44| Pretty straightforward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=2804)|
| 0:46:47| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=2807)|
| 0:46:49| Number six.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=2809)|
| 0:46:51| Number six.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=2811)|
| 0:46:52| Section 6.01B of the North Carolina Charter be amended to conform to state law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=2812)|
| 0:46:58| and place the responsibility of your county to North Carolina for that state's districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=2818)|
| 0:47:06| Here again, although it's the same change, it's in a different section of the charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=2826)|
| 0:47:14| So, therefore, that's you had to have two ballots as far as the commission is the sole group to vote on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=2834)|
| 0:47:25| boundaries of the school board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=2845)|
| 0:47:30| All I would say is that there is a lot of places in the charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=2850)|
| 0:47:36| And as a member of this committee, I'm really glad that I participated because it did kind of force me to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=2856)|
| 0:47:44| actually read the charter and see what was in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=2864)|
| 0:47:47| And, you know, I'm someone who's fairly familiar with the way commission works and the process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=2867)|
| 0:47:55| but I never read the charter carefully.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=2875)|
| 0:47:58| And what we found was that there were areas where the charter was just wrong because state law did supersede it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=2878)|
| 0:48:05| And so we felt that, you know, we needed to clarify that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=2885)|
| 0:48:10| and get the charter to be a correct document as much as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=2890)|
| 0:48:15| Yeah, just a question and a comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=2895)|
| 0:48:17| I'm in agreeance that I think we probably need 15 commissioners with smaller community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=2897)|
| 0:48:24| I think a commissioner, a county commissioner now serves 50,000 people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=2904)|
| 0:48:28| That's a lot of people to serve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=2908)|
| 0:48:30| So I don't say we need 19 again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=2910)|
| 0:48:32| But if this passes, which I vote yes on it, this will affect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=2912)|
| 0:48:36| If we do go to 15 commissioners, Chairman Lutho, we're not going to have 15 school board members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=2916)|
| 0:48:43| No, and that's something that while we reference state law because state law says that we have nine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=2923)|
| 0:48:51| There was a private act passed many, many years ago that says Knox County shall have nine school board members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=2931)|
| 0:48:57| And so that's why I wanted to make sure that the charter reflected what we're going to have to have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=2937)|
| 0:49:03| and that is to have the nine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=2943)|
| 0:49:05| Now, if we wanted to, as a county, change the size of our school board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=2945)|
| 0:49:12| we would actually have to go to the state and get that changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=2952)|
| 0:49:19| No, here again, we're going to have to follow state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=2959)|
| 0:49:23| I was going to ask a question on the county ballot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=2963)|
| 0:49:29| That shall pass at 9.17 on October 1st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=2969)|
| 0:49:34| The event is no longer required in the clerk's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=2974)|
| 0:49:37| In any new life, Knox County State Legislature, any legislature,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=2977)|
| 0:49:41| those legislatures will have to change the people to more permanent than those states.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=2981)|
| 0:49:47| And so that's something we have to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=2987)|
| 0:49:50| It was one of those things, like Lisa said, when you dig into the charter, you saw a lot of verbiage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=2990)|
| 0:49:56| nonsensical language, things that didn't mirror state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=2996)|
| 0:50:00| This was something that was, it seemed like it could have been written in the days when you had to inform people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=3000)|
| 0:50:09| in a written document because you couldn't call them or e-mail them or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=3009)|
| 0:50:13| So it was cleaning up our charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=3013)|
| 0:50:18| I believe, and Chairman Lutho could correct me if I'm wrong,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=3018)|
| 0:50:22| is that when we passed the term limits back in the charter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=3022)|
| 0:50:25| it actually said there were term limits on U.S. Senators, on U.S. Representatives, on state representatives,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=3025)|
| 0:50:31| which we know we at the local level can't put limits on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=3031)|
| 0:50:36| And part of this is just the overall effort to clean up parts of the charter that really didn't need to be in there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=3036)|
| 0:50:44| because we don't have the authority to make those changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=3044)|
| 0:51:03| When we went through this, there were, you know, parts that I agreed didn't agree with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=3063)|
| 0:51:10| And, you know, particularly with term limits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=3070)|
| 0:51:12| But I think what's really important is whatever's in the charter is absolutely clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=3072)|
| 0:51:17| We don't have any of the haziness that was there, particularly concerning term limits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=3077)|
| 0:51:22| I think what there is now is very clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=3082)|
| 0:51:26| It's very concise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=3086)|
| 0:51:27| It's legally defensible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=3087)|
| 0:51:28| It's not something that people would look at and say, what do they mean by that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=3088)|
| 0:51:32| And I support voting for all seven of these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=3092)|
| 0:51:37| And even with the amendments that we had in August as well that the voters also had to look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=3097)|
| 0:51:44| I think the one thing is for the Knox County residents to not only to look at these seven amendments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=3104)|
| 0:51:51| but take time to go and read the whole charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=3111)|
| 0:51:55| The educational part of this is knowing exactly how this affects you in your life as a citizen of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=3115)|
| 0:52:04| Going through this charter was a very informative process, even with my colleagues that were here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=3124)|
| 0:52:09| because we did not agree on everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=3129)|
| 0:52:12| But at the end of the day, we all agreed on what would be best for all of us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=3132)|
| 0:52:18| because we were included in this process as well as citizens of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=3138)|
| 0:52:23| So these amendments that you do have before you to vote on in November, go back and read them some more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=3143)|
| 0:52:31| You know, I'm in favor of them because I think it makes this government better| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=3151)|
| 0:52:36| and it makes the ability to serve the people better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=3156)|
| 0:52:39| Is it perfect?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=3159)|
| 0:52:40| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=3160)|
| 0:52:41| But it is a stepping stone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=3161)|
| 0:52:44| It is a starting point for us to continue to be better and get better as a people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=3164)|
| 0:52:53| I think that what I learned that I'd like to share is that our charter is a living plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=3173)|
| 0:53:01| and that we went through a process that was spelled out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=3181)|
| 0:53:05| We had citizen input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=3185)|
| 0:53:08| And the thing that I appreciate is that the charter also includes, and we are not changing that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=3188)|
| 0:53:18| how you make changes in years to come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=3198)|
| 0:53:23| When the uniformed officers plan was voted on by the citizens,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=3203)|
| 0:53:30| we had no idea and could not anticipate the economic impact and what it would do to our revenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=3210)|
| 0:53:40| But because the charter allows citizens to look at the current environment, to look at,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=3220)|
| 0:53:48| to look at, assess our societal needs, governmental needs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=3228)|
| 0:53:52| we have the ability as citizens, as on a process, to make those changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=3232)|
| 0:53:59| I support the changes that the committee has recommended| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=3239)|
| 0:54:03| and that the law department has put on the ballot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=3243)|
| 0:54:05| But I also encourage people to get involved because, you know, what you don't like, in a few years you can help change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=3245)|
| 0:54:16| So I would recommend everyone vote yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=3256)|
| 0:54:19| I wouldn't fault anybody if they voted no on number three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=3259)|
| 0:54:23| But, you know, I've already early voted, and I voted yes on all of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=3263)|
| 0:54:27| I think we did a good job, and I'm real proud of what we did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=3267)|
| 0:54:31| It was a unique experience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=3271)|
| 0:54:34| And folks sitting out there in the audience, I think you're the kind of folks that should, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=3274)|
| 0:54:40| step up next time and be on the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=3280)|
| 0:54:43| I think you guys are the folks that are interested to take a night| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=3283)|
| 0:54:46| and come listen to these shouts and all that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=3286)|
| 0:54:50| I think that's great, and I think you would enjoy the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=3290)|
| 0:54:54| I enjoyed it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=3294)|
| 0:54:56| I do want to say one thing that one of the things that I really learned through the process is that the charter is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=3296)|
| 0:55:04| these things that go into the charter and the UOP is a good example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=3304)|
| 0:55:08| You don't want to be handcuffed by the charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=3308)|
| 0:55:13| The charter is a framework, and you want to make things that go in the charter be a framework.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=3313)|
| 0:55:18| And you don't want to create, you know, suicide pact situations where you can't accomplish good government| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=3318)|
| 0:55:27| through your process of commission and elected officials, and the UOP is a good example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=3327)|
| 0:55:33| I think that first amendment is critical.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=3333)|
| 0:55:36| We should vote yes on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=3336)|
| 0:55:38| It does a good job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=3338)|
| 0:55:40| There's no great solution to any of these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=3340)|
| 0:55:43| That's one thing I learned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=3343)|
| 0:55:44| But that number one does a good job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=3344)|
| 0:55:47| There's maybe better solutions, but we found a good one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=3347)|
| 0:55:54| Well, I am planning to vote for all of them, and I would certainly encourage everyone to vote yes on all of these amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=3354)|
| 0:56:04| I was honored to serve on this committee, and I greatly enjoyed it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=3364)|
| 0:56:10| I think it is something, as just kind of an ordinary citizen, you know, I've never been elected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=3370)|
| 0:56:18| I've never been in government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=3378)|
| 0:56:20| I try to stay current with it, and I have been involved civically, but, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=3380)|
| 0:56:27| in some ways was kind of an outsider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=3387)|
| 0:56:28| And so I really want to thank Mayor Burchett for appointing me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=3388)|
| 0:56:33| It's been a great experience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=3393)|
| 0:56:35| I didn't get to come to as many meetings as I'd like because of a family illness,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=3395)|
| 0:56:40| but I certainly participated to the best of my abilities and was really glad I did it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=3400)|
| 0:56:49| And I think that if you ever are offered an opportunity to do it, that you should do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=3409)|
| 0:56:54| It's highly recommended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=3414)|
| 0:56:57| First of all, I want to thank my fellow committee members for their time and efforts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=3417)|
| 0:57:05| They put in a lot of work, and we started this process in February.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=3425)|
| 0:57:10| We put, was it seven, eight ballot questions in August, and we have another seven here in November.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=3430)|
| 0:57:19| And I want to thank all of them for their time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=3439)|
| 0:57:21| I want to thank them for having the confidence in me and voting me for chairmanship.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=3441)|
| 0:57:26| It's an honor that I'll always remember.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=3446)|
| 0:57:30| I want to thank Eugene for being here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=3450)|
| 0:57:33| And I want to thank the League of Women Voters for putting this forum on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=3453)|
| 0:57:37| And I want to thank the audience for showing up tonight and giving up a thirsty night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=3457)|
| 0:57:43| As Dr. Page said, this is a framework, just like you think of the Constitution of the United States.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=3463)|
| 0:57:50| It's a framework that the government can follow and make laws in how we govern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=3470)|
| 0:57:56| And think of the charter as the Constitution of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=3476)|
| 0:58:03| And I think that's the goal, is that we need to have that framework when we're working for the people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=3483)|
| 0:58:11| And it's very important that you have citizen involvement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=3491)|
| 0:58:15| So I just urge everybody to read these questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=3495)|
| 0:58:20| If you have a chance, read the charter and see what the impact is and be ready to go out there and vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=3500)|
| 0:58:28| And I would encourage them to be prepared when they walk into that booth because,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=3508)|
| 0:58:35| as Gene and I were talking about earlier, it's the presidential election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=3515)|
| 0:58:39| There's going to be long lines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=3519)|
| 0:58:41| And the more prepared people are to vote on these,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=3521)|
| 0:58:44| then the quicker they'll be able to scroll through all of those, including the city's ballot question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=3524)|
| 0:58:50| so that the folks that are wanting to vote behind you won't have to wait quite as long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=3530)|
| 0:58:56| And I would encourage them to vote yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=3536)|
| 0:58:58| Let me add my thanks to the Chief Justice of New Jersey for the past three years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=3538)|
| 0:59:04| And just as I know, Chief Justice has said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=3544)|
| 0:59:07| but obviously he did go through the filth of their workplace establishment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=3547)|
| 0:59:12| So thank you for taking the chair and doing such a great job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=3552)|
| 0:59:16| Thank you, those of you in the audience, for coming to the Senate tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=3556)|
| 0:59:19| to attend the QCB Project Live on their website.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=3559)|
| 0:59:24| If you would like to go back and watch again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=3564)|
| 0:59:26| And again, thanks for everybody who's been running up and running and standing where they are voting on the ballot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=3566)|
| 0:59:33| You know, there's sometimes awful times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=3573)|
| 0:59:36| There's sometimes, you know, we get in there and we're out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=3576)|
| 0:59:41| We have done our homework, and I think this is a great example of how.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=3581)|
| 0:59:45| We didn't know what to talk about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=3585)|
| 0:59:47| But certainly we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=3587)|
| 0:59:49| I wouldn't be surprised if I was on the floor here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=3589)|
| 0:59:52| I don't know why I have to have a grasp of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=3592)|
| 0:59:54| But what you all have to do is live long and get to know the rest of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=3594)|
| 1:00:00| Thanks, all of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121018CharterForum?start=3600)|
