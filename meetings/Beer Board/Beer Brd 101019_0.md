| 0:01:57| There is a quorum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101019?start=117)|
| 0:01:58| I have a motion to approve the minutes as distributed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101019?start=118)|
| 0:02:01| Moved to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101019?start=121)|
| 0:02:02| Any questions on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101019?start=122)|
| 0:02:03| If not, all those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101019?start=123)|
| 0:02:09| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101019?start=129)|
| 0:02:10| Those no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101019?start=130)|
| 0:02:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101019?start=131)|
| 0:02:12| I recognize Councilwoman Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101019?start=132)|
| 0:02:15| Thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101019?start=135)|
| 0:02:16| We have a representative with us tonight from the Metropolitan Drug Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101019?start=136)|
| 0:02:20| I'd like to introduce Heather Sutton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101019?start=140)|
| 0:02:22| Heather, if you'd like to come up to the microphone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101019?start=142)|
| 0:02:25| She would like to, with Beer Board's indulgence, make a brief announcement about some materials| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101019?start=145)|
| 0:02:30| that the Metropolitan Drug Commission has to distribute to our new permittees to aid with prevention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101019?start=150)|
| 0:02:37| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101019?start=157)|
| 0:02:38| MDC has partnered with Top Shelf Responsible Beverage Service, and we have Kim Pouncey here with us today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101019?start=158)|
| 0:02:44| She's the president of Top Shelf.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101019?start=164)|
| 0:02:45| To maybe explain a little bit more about this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101019?start=165)|
| 0:02:47| but the Metropolitan Drug Commission has purchased these DVD training toolkits through Top Shelf| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101019?start=167)|
| 0:02:53| to provide free of charge to any business, either at the Beer Board meetings, new permit holders,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101019?start=173)|
| 0:02:58| or just by calling our office by request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101019?start=178)|
| 0:03:01| They're completely free.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101019?start=181)|
| 0:03:02| It comes with an instructional DVD, different sorts of instructional materials inside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101019?start=182)|
| 0:03:08| And I'll hand it off, if that's all right, to Ms. Kim Pouncey,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101019?start=188)|
| 0:03:11| and she can explain in a little more detail about her toolkits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101019?start=191)|
| 0:03:15| Mr. Chairman, would that be all right, if Ms. Pouncey?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101019?start=195)|
| 0:03:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101019?start=198)|
| 0:03:23| These toolkits were actually constructed in a way to deal with carting in a very specific training method.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101019?start=203)|
| 0:03:34| There's a DVD.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101019?start=214)|
| 0:03:35| There's the tools that include the booklet that has all of the driver's licenses throughout the entire country in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101019?start=215)|
| 0:03:44| There's the ID coders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101019?start=224)|
| 0:03:46| There's an exam.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101019?start=226)|
| 0:03:48| There's a student workbook.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101019?start=228)|
| 0:03:49| There's a training manual for managers so that they are required to cover all company policy, state and local laws,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101019?start=229)|
| 0:03:57| and this is all documented and can be put in the employee's folder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101019?start=237)|
| 0:04:01| So this has nothing to do with anything but carting, and that's all we cover in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101019?start=241)|
| 0:04:07| So we partner with the MDC and some other coalitions, and we're trying to help with underage sales.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101019?start=247)|
| 0:04:13| Ms. Pouncey, you didn't say your name and your business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101019?start=253)|
| 0:04:15| I am so sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101019?start=255)|
| 0:04:16| My name is Kim Pouncey, and I'm the president of Straight Up LLC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101019?start=256)|
| 0:04:20| and we produce the top shelf responsible training materials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101019?start=260)|
| 0:04:24| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101019?start=264)|
| 0:04:27| Thank you both for coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101019?start=267)|

| 0:04:38| Can you give your name and address for the record, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101019?start=278)|
| 0:04:40| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101019?start=280)|
| 0:04:41| My name is Jim Lari.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101019?start=281)|
| 0:04:42| I'm the executive director at Blunt Mansion Association,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101019?start=282)|
| 0:04:45| and our address is right down here at 200 West Hill Avenue, Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101019?start=285)|
| 0:04:50| and we're having our fall fundraiser this coming Friday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101019?start=290)|
| 0:04:54| and that's why we're coming before the beer board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101019?start=294)|
| 0:04:58| Friday from when to when?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101019?start=298)|
| 0:05:01| The event starts at 6, and it will go to about 8, 30, 9 o'clock,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101019?start=301)|
| 0:05:07| and we'll be having not only moonshine tasting, but beer will be served as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101019?start=307)|
| 0:05:14| also sort of southern cooking, historical demonstrations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101019?start=314)|
| 0:05:19| and other historical presentations as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101019?start=319)|
| 0:05:25| Is there a moonshine board, too?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101019?start=325)|
| 0:05:30| Well, we went through the state for that permitting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101019?start=330)|
| 0:05:32| and we have those permits in hand, licenses in hand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101019?start=332)|
| 0:05:36| Good for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101019?start=336)|
| 0:05:37| No record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101019?start=337)|
| 0:05:39| File is complete.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101019?start=339)|
| 0:05:41| Move approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101019?start=341)|
| 0:05:42| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101019?start=342)|
| 0:05:43| Seeing no lights, all those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101019?start=343)|

| 0:05:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101019?start=349)|
| 0:05:51| The chair would like to defer Chipotle Mexican Grill until the next beer board meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101019?start=351)|
| 0:05:56| scheduled beer board meeting, which is scheduled November the 16th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101019?start=356)|
| 0:06:03| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101019?start=363)|
| 0:06:04| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101019?start=364)|
| 0:06:06| They're still working on their package there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101019?start=366)|
| 0:06:10| They've got some issues they need to get cleared up with the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101019?start=370)|
| 0:06:14| And seeing no light, one light.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101019?start=374)|
| 0:06:16| Mr. Chairman, I was wondering,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101019?start=376)|
| 0:06:17| are we going to get to see a copy of what was presented earlier, a package?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101019?start=377)|
| 0:06:22| I would mind to take a look at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101019?start=382)|
| 0:06:24| Oh, the packets of the Metropolitan Drug Commission, yes, we have plenty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101019?start=384)|
| 0:06:28| I'm immediate past president of the Metropolitan Drug Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101019?start=388)|
| 0:06:32| Sure, we can ask Ms. Sutton to save one for each council member at the end of the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101019?start=392)|
| 0:06:36| And these are available to just for anyone who might be watching this meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101019?start=396)|
| 0:06:39| They're available from the Drug Commission to any business, whether they're a new permittee or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101019?start=399)|
| 0:06:44| Anyone who's interested in supplementary training materials to assist with the prevention of underage drinking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101019?start=404)|
| 0:06:50| is welcome to contact the MDC to receive a packet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101019?start=410)|
| 0:06:52| But, yeah, we'll get some for council members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101019?start=412)|
| 0:06:54| Good idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101019?start=414)|
| 0:06:55| And there was a motion and a second on the deferral.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101019?start=415)|
| 0:06:58| All those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101019?start=418)|
| 0:07:00| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101019?start=420)|
| 0:07:01| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101019?start=421)|
| 0:07:02| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101019?start=422)|
| 0:07:03| Discount Tobacco Mart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101019?start=423)|
| 0:07:08| Hello.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101019?start=428)|
| 0:07:10| Come down to the microphone, please, and give your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101019?start=430)|
| 0:07:14| I'm Paresh Kumar Patel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101019?start=434)|
| 0:07:17| I have a store at 5814 North Broadway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101019?start=437)|
| 0:07:20| It's a new store.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101019?start=440)|
| 0:07:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101019?start=442)|
| 0:07:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101019?start=443)|
| 0:07:24| No record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101019?start=444)|
| 0:07:26| Waiting on approval for the Building Inspector, Fire Inspector, and Health Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101019?start=446)|
| 0:07:31| I'll move to approve pending documentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101019?start=451)|
| 0:07:34| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101019?start=454)|
| 0:07:37| Seeing no last, all those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101019?start=457)|
| 0:07:40| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101019?start=460)|
| 0:07:46| Haru Hibachi and Sushi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101019?start=466)|
| 0:07:49| That's as close as I can get.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101019?start=469)|
| 0:08:00| Let me make a motion to move this to the end of the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101019?start=480)|
| 0:08:05| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101019?start=485)|
| 0:08:07| All those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101019?start=487)|
| 0:08:08| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101019?start=488)|
| 0:08:14| I think they deferred, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101019?start=494)|
| 0:08:15| That concerns me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101019?start=495)|
| 0:08:16| Hopefully they didn't get confused.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101019?start=496)|
| 0:08:19| They received written notification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101019?start=499)|
| 0:08:20| They did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101019?start=500)|
| 0:08:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101019?start=501)|
| 0:08:28| Jackson Avenue Market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101019?start=508)|
| 0:08:32| Your name and address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101019?start=512)|
| 0:08:35| Matthew Weidenhammer, 200 West Jackson Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101019?start=515)|
| 0:08:39| No applicable record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101019?start=519)|
| 0:08:41| We're waiting on a copy of the sales tax registration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101019?start=521)|
| 0:08:43| and approval from the Building Inspector, Fire Inspector, and Health Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101019?start=523)|
| 0:08:47| I believe that would be the 6th District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101019?start=527)|
| 0:08:50| Move to approve pending final documentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101019?start=530)|
| 0:08:54| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101019?start=534)|
| 0:08:55| Seeing no last, Councilwoman Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101019?start=535)|
| 0:08:59| I have a question for Sergeant Hunter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101019?start=539)|
| 0:09:01| On the record checks, there are a couple things listed under applicable record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101019?start=541)|
| 0:09:06| They don't seem to me to sound like they would be applicable to this permit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101019?start=546)|
| 0:09:09| but I'm just curious why they made it in that box.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101019?start=549)|
| 0:09:12| That was just a mistake on my part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101019?start=552)|
| 0:09:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101019?start=554)|
| 0:09:15| So there is not an applicable record for this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101019?start=555)|
| 0:09:16| No, there is not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101019?start=556)|
| 0:09:17| Terrific.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101019?start=557)|
| 0:09:18| Thank you for clarifying that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101019?start=558)|
| 0:09:19| And one other minor, I assume it's minor, Mr. Swanson, if I'm wrong about being minor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101019?start=559)|
| 0:09:23| I'm sure we'll jump in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101019?start=563)|
| 0:09:25| Has Ridgedale Elementary School is the closest,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101019?start=565)|
| 0:09:27| and obviously I think Green Elementary would probably be the closest,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101019?start=567)|
| 0:09:31| but I know it meets the standard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101019?start=571)|
| 0:09:33| And seeing no other likes, all those in favor of the motion, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101019?start=573)|
| 0:09:37| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101019?start=577)|
| 0:09:39| You'll see Ms. Day, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101019?start=579)|
| 0:09:43| Just right, Union Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101019?start=583)|
| 0:09:54| Name and address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101019?start=594)|
| 0:09:56| I'm Kristen Ferber, and the address of the storefront is 513 Union Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101019?start=596)|
| 0:10:02| And I'm Charlotte Tolley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101019?start=602)|
| 0:10:05| No applicable record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101019?start=605)|
| 0:10:07| We're waiting for approval from the Building Inspector, Fire Inspector, and Health Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101019?start=607)|
| 0:10:11| And that would be the 6th District once again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101019?start=611)|
| 0:10:14| Move to approve and file documentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101019?start=614)|
| 0:10:16| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101019?start=616)|
| 0:10:17| Councilwoman Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101019?start=617)|
| 0:10:18| Yes, I actually met the owners on Saturday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101019?start=618)|
| 0:10:21| They've been at the farmer's market all this summer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101019?start=621)|
| 0:10:24| Do you all want to give a brief plug on where you've been this summer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101019?start=624)|
| 0:10:27| and why you're moving down to Union?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101019?start=627)|
| 0:10:29| Well, this summer we have been at the Market Square farmer's market as a vendor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101019?start=629)|
| 0:10:33| We sell out of a little trailer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101019?start=633)|
| 0:10:35| We sell prepared foods made from local and regional ingredients as much as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101019?start=635)|
| 0:10:40| We're opening a storefront to expand that business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101019?start=640)|
| 0:10:43| And we're also interested in supporting our local producers by selling retail, the products that they have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101019?start=643)|
| 0:10:50| So we'll have some basic grocery items available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101019?start=650)|
| 0:10:54| Everything on the menu looked incredibly delicious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101019?start=654)|
| 0:10:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101019?start=656)|
| 0:10:57| Good luck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101019?start=657)|
| 0:10:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101019?start=658)|
| 0:11:00| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101019?start=660)|
| 0:11:01| All those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101019?start=661)|
| 0:11:02| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101019?start=662)|
| 0:11:04| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101019?start=664)|
| 0:11:05| If you'll see Ms. Day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101019?start=665)|
| 0:11:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101019?start=666)|
| 0:11:08| Next up is the line-up, 6547 Chapman Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101019?start=668)|
| 0:11:16| Your name and address, please, for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101019?start=676)|
| 0:11:18| Samantha Allen at 6547 Chapman Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101019?start=678)|
| 0:11:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101019?start=683)|
| 0:11:24| Sergeant Hunter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101019?start=684)|
| 0:11:25| No record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101019?start=685)|
| 0:11:27| We're waiting on approval from the Building Inspector, Fire Inspector, Health Department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101019?start=687)|
| 0:11:30| and the previous owner has not surrendered the beer permit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101019?start=690)|
| 0:11:33| but there is a hearing scheduled this Thursday to nullify that beer permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101019?start=693)|
| 0:11:40| And that would actually fall into my district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101019?start=700)|
| 0:11:42| And I'll make the motion subject to all of the above being approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101019?start=702)|
| 0:11:46| Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101019?start=706)|
| 0:11:47| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101019?start=707)|
| 0:11:51| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101019?start=711)|
| 0:11:52| If it gets revoked, there's a possibility that it may be revoked at the hearing on Thursday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101019?start=712)|
| 0:11:58| So I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101019?start=718)|
| 0:12:03| Sir, we do have our own lease.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101019?start=723)|
| 0:12:06| She was evicted from the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101019?start=726)|
| 0:12:09| We did not know this prior to leasing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101019?start=729)|
| 0:12:12| We sort of just walked into this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101019?start=732)|
| 0:12:15| So we, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101019?start=735)|
| 0:12:17| The revocation follows the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101019?start=737)|
| 0:12:20| So let's hear from Mr. Swanson here and then we'll move forward on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101019?start=740)|
| 0:12:24| I think it would be appropriate for you to make an inquiry as to whether| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101019?start=744)|
| 0:12:27| or not there's any relationship between the persons who hold this permit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101019?start=747)|
| 0:12:31| and the persons who hold the previous permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101019?start=751)|
| 0:12:34| And if you find it to be appropriate, if there is not such a relationship,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101019?start=754)|
| 0:12:38| then you could go ahead and move to waive the prohibition on issuing a permit for that same location for a year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101019?start=758)|
| 0:12:46| assuming that they do, in fact, qualify for the permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101019?start=766)|
| 0:12:50| Thank you for saying that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101019?start=770)|
| 0:12:52| Is there any relationship between the prior owners?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101019?start=772)|
| 0:12:55| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101019?start=775)|
| 0:12:56| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101019?start=776)|
| 0:12:57| So I will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101019?start=777)|
| 0:12:58| We are Lopez and we are Durham.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101019?start=778)|
| 0:13:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101019?start=780)|
| 0:13:01| And I'll make that a, I will amend my motion to include what Mr. Swanson said there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101019?start=781)|
| 0:13:07| That's Mayor Baker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101019?start=787)|
| 0:13:08| I guess just for clarity's sake, who was the last owner and why is it being revoked?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101019?start=788)|
| 0:13:13| It was Iris Lopez, El Tanapa, Garibaldi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101019?start=793)|
| 0:13:16| That's the location that we did the undercover sting a few months ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101019?start=796)|
| 0:13:22| It was on the news.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101019?start=802)|
| 0:13:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101019?start=804)|
| 0:13:25| Seeing no further lights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101019?start=805)|
| 0:13:26| All those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101019?start=806)|
| 0:13:27| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101019?start=807)|
| 0:13:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101019?start=808)|
| 0:13:29| If you'll see Ms. Day, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101019?start=809)|
| 0:13:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101019?start=810)|

| 0:13:39| Tobasco.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101019?start=819)|
| 0:13:40| See that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101019?start=820)|
| 0:13:41| It's a Freudian thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101019?start=821)|

| 0:13:43| Tobasco.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101019?start=823)|
| 0:13:44| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101019?start=824)|
| 0:13:45| We're waiting on approval from the building inspector, fire inspector, and health department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101019?start=825)|
| 0:13:46| And that would be the third district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101019?start=826)|
| 0:13:47| Move to approve pending.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101019?start=827)|
| 0:13:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101019?start=828)|

| 0:14:11| Ms. Brown, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101019?start=851)|
| 0:14:12| There is an addendum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101019?start=852)|
| 0:14:13| You approve the permit subject to final documentation for crew at 11383 Parkside Drive and that time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101019?start=853)|
| 0:14:24| is elapsing and the applicant is here to address you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101019?start=864)|

| 0:14:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101019?start=873)|
| 0:14:34| Parkside Drive, and I'm requesting a 60-day extension to finalize all of our inspections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101019?start=874)|
| 0:14:46| That would be, I believe, the 2nd District for 60 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101019?start=886)|
| 0:14:52| 60 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101019?start=892)|
| 0:14:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101019?start=893)|
| 0:14:54| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101019?start=894)|
| 0:14:55| Any discussion on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101019?start=895)|
| 0:14:56| I'm seeing no lights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101019?start=896)|

| 0:15:01| Extension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101019?start=901)|
| 0:15:02| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101019?start=902)|
| 0:15:04| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101019?start=904)|
| 0:15:05| And then I'll ask one more time if Haru, if they're here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101019?start=905)|
| 0:15:10| I don't think they are here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101019?start=910)|
| 0:15:14| So I will make a motion to move it until 11-16 at the next scheduled beer board meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101019?start=914)|
| 0:15:23| All those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101019?start=923)|
