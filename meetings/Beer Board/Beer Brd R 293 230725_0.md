| 0:00:30| All right everybody we'll call this meeting to order. Welcome to the July| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230725?start=30)|

| 0:00:55| Seven present. Thank you. Do I have a motion to approve the June minutes? Move to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230725?start=55)|
| 0:01:00| approve. All right any discussion? All those in favor? Aye. Any opposed? So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230725?start=60)|
| 0:01:08| All right today's agenda includes six beer permit applications and seven| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230725?start=68)|
| 0:01:13| addendum items but first we do have an order of business to conduct addressing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230725?start=73)|
| 0:01:19| a new state law that took effect on July 1st. I trust all of you read Mr. Frost's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230725?start=79)|
| 0:01:24| email that the new state law requires the opportunity for individuals to make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230725?start=84)|
| 0:01:30| germane public comments related to the current meeting's agenda items. For the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230725?start=90)|
| 0:01:36| record I would like to read the proposal Mr. Frost, Mr. Burr, Mr. Johnson and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230725?start=96)|
| 0:01:42| myself discussed that proposal and then open the floor to any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230725?start=102)|
| 0:01:49| discussion or questions. The requested proposal is that before the first beer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230725?start=109)|
| 0:01:58| application request is heard that the beer board take up public comments that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230725?start=118)|
| 0:02:03| are germane only to the items on that day's agenda and at that time all people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230725?start=123)|
| 0:02:09| not the applicants who will still speak when their application is called who| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230725?start=129)|
| 0:02:14| have signed up to offer germane comments on an agenda item would then speak. Based| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230725?start=134)|
| 0:02:19| on I think we all know we believe it will be very rare that someone actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230725?start=139)|
| 0:02:25| does speak so we can comply with the new law by offering the comment time at the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230725?start=145)|
| 0:02:32| beginning of the meeting and then continue with the meeting procedure that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230725?start=152)|
| 0:02:35| everyone is accustomed to. We're recommending a limit of three speakers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230725?start=155)|
| 0:02:39| per agenda item during the comment period at the beginning of the meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230725?start=159)|
| 0:02:42| with a two-minute limit for each. And I know that Mr. Burr, Mr. Johnson they'll| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230725?start=162)|
| 0:02:49| handle sign-ups but I wanted to see if Mr. Johnson if you wanted to discuss| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230725?start=169)|
| 0:02:52| kind of the cutoff times and the details of that discussion. Thank you. The cutoff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230725?start=172)|
| 0:03:01| time that I had envisioned would be the same that we have for City Council. When| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230725?start=181)|
| 0:03:05| the meeting is called to order that's when the cutoff time would be. That's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230725?start=185)|
| 0:03:09| what we had discussed. But they could call or email Mr. Burr? Yes, prior to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230725?start=189)|
| 0:03:14| meeting they could call Mr. Burr's office before four o'clock. Is that what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230725?start=194)|
| 0:03:18| yes? Before four o'clock they could call the revenue office. If they don't meet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230725?start=198)|
| 0:03:24| that time they could come up to this desk and speak with me and sign up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230725?start=204)|
| 0:03:29| before the meeting begins. Anything to add Mr. Burr? Nope, that summed it up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230725?start=209)|
| 0:03:37| nicely. All right. Any questions or discussion on what's being proposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230725?start=217)|
| 0:03:45| Okay. Do I have a motion? Move to approve. Second. All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230725?start=225)|
| 0:03:52| Any further discussion? So all those in favor? Any opposed? All right. So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230725?start=232)|
| 0:04:00| Thank you for that. So at this time I'll ask if there's anybody here that has any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230725?start=240)|
| 0:04:05| germane comments they'd like to make related to today's agenda. All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230725?start=245)|
| 0:04:10| Seeing none, let's get started. When I do call the name of the business or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230725?start=250)|
| 0:04:16| organization applying for the permit, please come to the podium, state your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230725?start=256)|
| 0:04:19| name and address clearly for the record. And then applicants who are approved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230725?start=259)|
| 0:04:23| pending final documentation need to bring their completed documents to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230725?start=263)|
| 0:04:27| Business Tax Office during regular hours Monday through Friday 8 to 4 30. And| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230725?start=267)|
| 0:04:33| applicants who have their permit approved tonight can pick it up at the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230725?start=273)|
| 0:04:37| end of the meeting. So first up we have Dash and Go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230725?start=277)|
| 0:04:50| Welcome. Is it on? It is on. Hi, I am Tamalyn Harper with Dash and Go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230725?start=290)|
| 0:04:56| convenience store. It is 2128 East Magnolia Avenue here in Knoxville 37917.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230725?start=296)|
| 0:05:03| Okay. Anything you want to share about this new business? No, not at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230725?start=303)|
| 0:05:15| It's very new to me, so I'm trying to figure it out. This is not my first| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230725?start=315)|
| 0:05:22| business, but this is the first convenience store I've ever put together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230725?start=322)|
| 0:05:27| Okay. Sergeant Coward. No applicable record. Mr. Byrd. We need a copy of the sales tax| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230725?start=327)|
| 0:05:33| registration and approvals from the building inspections and fire department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230725?start=333)|
| 0:05:38| So the inspections, so we got the, I think it was the building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230725?start=338)|
| 0:05:44| inspectors that came by. They told us the only thing that we needed to do, I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230725?start=344)|
| 0:05:49| needed to do, was put the exit sign up and the fire extinguishers, which I have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230725?start=349)|
| 0:05:54| those. They also told me they were going to come back because they said they've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230725?start=354)|
| 0:05:57| never seen anything like this before because it's actually a store that you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230725?start=357)|
| 0:06:01| drive through. So they were going to bring, I think the guy, the man| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230725?start=361)|
| 0:06:05| that had come said this was normally not his route. So he was going to get, I guess| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230725?start=365)|
| 0:06:12| the inspector that actually does that to come back, but they haven't reached back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230725?start=372)|
| 0:06:16| out to me or come back. They told me to meet them there after I did the CAS class.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230725?start=376)|
| 0:06:22| We had a time, but of course that didn't happen. As far as with the health| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230725?start=382)|
| 0:06:31| inspection and the other inspection, I was confused on, they told me I could| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230725?start=391)|
| 0:06:36| draw up the documentation as far as I guess how the building is going to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230725?start=396)|
| 0:06:41| set up, the layout. I was confused on that. I called three times, but luckily| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230725?start=401)|
| 0:06:45| today someone came out and actually helped me draw up those plans. So I have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230725?start=405)|
| 0:06:49| that. I can submit that in the morning. I didn't know I was missing anything else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230725?start=409)|
| 0:06:56| Sales tax registration from the Department of Revenue. Okay, so just a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230725?start=416)|
| 0:07:01| copy of that. Okay, so I have that as well. But like I say, I was very confused on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230725?start=421)|
| 0:07:06| drawing up plans. I've never done that before. In previous businesses, we always| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230725?start=426)|
| 0:07:11| had to get like an architect or somebody that knew about that. When I spoke to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230725?start=431)|
| 0:07:16| the lady on the phone, she said I could do it myself, which I've never done that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230725?start=436)|
| 0:07:20| So I was totally confused. I tried it, didn't know what I was doing. So I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230725?start=440)|
| 0:07:24| started seeking help, and luckily today a friend of mine came and helped us do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230725?start=444)|
| 0:07:29| that. All right, I'll go ahead and make a motion to approve pending final| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230725?start=449)|
| 0:07:35| documentation. Second. All right, any discussion? All those in favor? Aye. Any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230725?start=455)|

| 0:09:50| Coward. No record. Mr. Byrd. We would just need building inspections approval and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230725?start=590)|
| 0:09:56| then surrender of the existing permit. All right, any discussion? All those in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230725?start=596)|
| 0:10:06| favor? Aye. Any opposed? All right, so moved. Thank you. All right, moving on to our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230725?start=606)|
| 0:10:15| addendum items. First, we have Crafty Bastard, Baker Creek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230725?start=615)|
| 0:10:28| Hi, I'm Aaron McLean, 2320 Jefferson Avenue. All right, how's it going?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230725?start=628)|
| 0:10:34| Well, it's, as you might know, 71 South is already open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230725?start=634)|
| 0:10:40| Bear Paw Bikes is already open. Yeah, it's a nearly 100-year-old building and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230725?start=640)|
| 0:10:45| there's been a lot of drywall and old floors and a lot of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230725?start=645)|
| 0:10:49| unanticipated things. But yeah, we're just a couple of weeks out, I think, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230725?start=649)|
| 0:10:55| given that it is a nearly 100-year-old building, I would like to request for 90| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230725?start=655)|
| 0:10:59| days. Basically, all we're lacking is fire inspection, health department, like the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230725?start=659)|
| 0:11:05| things that you need to actually be open, so. All right, Councilmember Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230725?start=665)|

| 0:11:26| slightly different than the other one. The first two have brewing operations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230725?start=686)|
| 0:11:29| and this is more like a satellite taproom, but it's gonna pair really well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230725?start=689)|
| 0:11:33| with the mountain biking and the food and all that good stuff, so we're excited| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230725?start=693)|
| 0:11:36| about it. So this is in the same building of Fly-by-Night? Oh no, so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230725?start=696)|

| 0:11:49| Highwire Brewing Company and Fly-by-Night and Threads and what's the thing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230725?start=709)|
| 0:11:55| Redbird Kitchen, Redbird Kitchen. Yeah, so that's one building. No, this is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230725?start=715)|
| 0:12:00| where the Baker Creek trails are. The city's putting in that big pavilion and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230725?start=720)|
| 0:12:04| all the stuff. Yeah, the Baker Creek trail complex. Yeah, so it's an old building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230725?start=724)|
| 0:12:08| there that's been vacant for almost 30 years and yeah, they renovated it and a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230725?start=728)|
| 0:12:12| couple businesses opening and more on the way. All right, so we have a motion and a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230725?start=732)|
