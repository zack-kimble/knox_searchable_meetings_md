| 0:16:04| I want to take just a minute to say, today I told my children who are watching at home that tonight will be an excellent example of local democracy in action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=964)|
| 0:16:13| We have an exceptionally large number of people in attendance tonight and speaking tonight, many of which have different ideologies and ideas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=973)|

| 0:16:57| So please be ready to speak when called.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=1017)|
| 0:16:59| We have two podiums set up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=1019)|
| 0:17:01| We have one down here on the lower level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=1021)|
| 0:17:03| We have also one on the upper level to accommodate everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=1023)|
| 0:17:06| So we do not have to wait for somebody to walk from the upper level to the lower level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=1026)|
| 0:17:10| Both are covered with CTV cameras.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=1030)|
| 0:17:13| Both are visible and have the ability for all of us to hear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=1033)|
| 0:17:16| Each person will be given five minutes to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=1036)|
| 0:17:19| However, I do want to point out that we have a lot on our agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=1039)|
| 0:17:23| We have a voting meeting at 7, a very large agenda to complete.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=1043)|
| 0:17:26| So if you'd like to consolidate ideas, pick someone to speak for a number of people all at once, or even make your brief comments brief, we would welcome so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=1046)|
| 0:17:34| A lot can be said in a small amount of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=1054)|

| 0:17:59| If you could please raise your hand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=1079)|
| 0:18:04| There's a podium and a microphone right there, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=1084)|
| 0:18:10| Peter Easton, are you here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=1090)|
| 0:18:12| Okay, if you'd like to take the podium and the microphone upstairs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=1092)|

| 0:18:36| Test.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=1116)|

| 0:18:40| You have five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=1120)|
| 0:18:41| My name is Peter Easton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=1121)|
| 0:18:44| I live at 6901 Ivystone Way in Knoxville, Tennessee, up in Halls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=1124)|
| 0:18:51| If it's painful for you to criticize your friends, you're safe in doing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=1131)|
| 0:18:57| If you take the slightest pleasure in it, that's the time to hold your tongue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=1137)|
| 0:19:04| That's a quote from Alice Dewar Miller.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=1144)|
| 0:19:07| She was an American author from 1874 to 1942.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=1147)|
| 0:19:13| This brings to mind what happened towards the end of the Board of Health meeting last Wednesday| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=1153)|
| 0:19:17| when out of nowhere the agenda quickly transitioned from that of conducting county-related business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=1157)|
| 0:19:23| to attacking the character and intentions of our county mayor, Glenn Jacobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=1163)|
| 0:19:28| In regards to a video he was part of, and while I usually disagree with the mayor on political leanings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=1168)|
| 0:19:35| I've always appreciated the fact that with Mayor Jacobs' character and integrity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=1175)|
| 0:19:40| they are above reproach and never should be questioned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=1180)|
| 0:19:47| On another point, I'm also a Navy radio man, veteran of Desert Storm,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=1187)|
| 0:19:54| and I was on the USS Mobile Bay CG-53 back in 1991 during the war,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=1194)|
| 0:20:01| and I do not appreciate being compared with terrorists or an enemy of this country| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=1201)|
| 0:20:07| because I don't share the same political leanings as some members of the Board of Health.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=1207)|
| 0:20:14| Citizens will come for redress.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=1214)|
| 0:20:17| They come to meetings like this to discuss things with you, the commissioner, or with our county mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=1217)|
| 0:20:26| That's called seeking redress.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=1226)|
| 0:20:28| That's called citizen participation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=1228)|
| 0:20:30| It's something we all do to better and make our government stronger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=1230)|
| 0:20:36| We should not be questioned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=1236)|
| 0:20:38| We should not be called terrorists as we do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=1238)|
| 0:20:44| With Dr. O'Brien being a veteran, and I respect him for his status as a veteran,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=1244)|
| 0:20:52| he should not use his status as a veteran and use it as a bully pulpit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=1252)|
| 0:20:58| to antagonize and attack a fellow member of Knox County government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=1258)|
| 0:21:04| That's not what we do as veterans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=1264)|
| 0:21:07| We never should politicize our veteran status.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=1267)|
| 0:21:12| Dr. O'Brien, you were wrong,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=1272)|
| 0:21:17| and you bring discredit to the veterans' community when you do things like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=1277)|
| 0:21:23| especially on Knox County business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=1283)|
| 0:21:29| The Board of Health is something that Knox County business should only be discussed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=1289)|
| 0:21:37| not to attack political opponents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=1297)|
| 0:21:42| I'm very disappointed that Dr. O'Brien chose to do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=1302)|
| 0:21:48| and I ask that he resign because of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=1308)|
| 0:21:52| Yes, you heard me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=1312)|
| 0:21:54| I'm asking Dr. O'Brien to resign because he abused his position| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=1314)|
| 0:22:00| as a member of the Board of Health to attack a fellow member of Knox County government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=1320)|
| 0:22:05| This never should have been allowed to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=1325)|
| 0:22:09| It is because of that that I have submitted an emergency proposal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=1329)|
| 0:22:14| and I believe Ms. Drusilla has distributed copies of a resolution to all you commissioners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=1334)|
| 0:22:22| and hopefully to Mr. Buick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=1342)|
| 0:22:25| I ask that you seriously consider that proposal tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=1345)|
| 0:22:30| to repeal the Knox County codes and to dissolve the Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=1350)|
| 0:22:35| They have turned into an entity of which business cannot be taken care of properly anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=1355)|
| 0:22:41| They've not become an instrument of the people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=1361)|
| 0:22:43| They've become an instrument of a political entity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=1363)|
| 0:22:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=1367)|

| 0:23:06| Before I get started, I'd like to clear one thing up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=1386)|
| 0:23:09| Commissioner Shoemaker, you asked Dr. Buchanan last week if masks were medical devices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=1389)|
| 0:23:13| She said no, cloth masks were not medical devices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=1393)|
| 0:23:16| However, I pulled up the FDA website, and I believe I emailed that to each and every one of you last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=1396)|
| 0:23:20| And here's what it says in regard to masks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=1400)|
| 0:23:23| Face masks, when they are intended for medical purposes such as source control,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=1403)|
| 0:23:27| including uses related to COVID-19 and surgical masks, are medical devices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=1407)|
| 0:23:33| So, yes, all masks being used to prevent the spread of COVID-19 are medical devices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=1413)|
| 0:23:40| So, Dr. Buchanan, not to be aware of that as a Knox County health officer is concerning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=1420)|
| 0:23:46| One in four people will die of heart disease this year alone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=1426)|
| 0:23:49| 600,000 will die from cancer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=1429)|
| 0:23:51| 300,000 people will die from obesity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=1431)|
| 0:23:54| Where does it end?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=1434)|
| 0:23:56| Thomas Jefferson stated that if people let the government decide what foods they eat and what medicines they take,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=1436)|
| 0:24:01| their bodies will soon be in as sorry a state as those who live under tyranny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=1441)|
| 0:24:05| If this is about public health, then the Board of Health must mandate healthy living,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=1445)|
| 0:24:09| food choices, exercise, and outlaw tobacco, cigarettes, and processed sugars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=1449)|
| 0:24:15| If this were about public health, then why were fast food restaurants, liquor stores,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=1455)|
| 0:24:19| and tobacco shops allowed to remain open as essential businesses?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=1459)|
| 0:24:23| Fast food, alcohol, tobacco are all contributors to chronic disease,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=1463)|
| 0:24:27| which contribute to adverse effects of COVID-19.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=1467)|
| 0:24:30| If this were truly about public health, and why stop at bars and restaurants?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=1470)|
| 0:24:38| If this was truly about public health, then shut down all businesses after 11 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=1478)|
| 0:24:43| I mean, after all, after bars and restaurants, people gather, they go to grocery stores,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=1483)|
| 0:24:47| they go to fast food restaurants, they go to gas stations and truck stops.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=1487)|
| 0:24:51| Don't stop there, shut them all down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=1491)|
| 0:24:54| But no, the Board of Health chooses one genre of business to shut down, to target.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=1494)|
| 0:24:59| So is this still about public health?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=1499)|
| 0:25:01| Benjamin Rush, a signer of the Declaration of Independence, stated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=1501)|
| 0:25:05| Unless we put medical freedom into the Constitution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=1505)|
| 0:25:07| a time will come when medicine will organize into an undercover dictatorship| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=1507)|
| 0:25:11| and will restrict the art of healing to one class of men and deny equal privileges to others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=1511)|
| 0:25:16| That time is now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=1516)|
| 0:25:18| These mandates have absolutely nothing to do with health,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=1518)|
| 0:25:21| but everything to do with complying with a tyrannical agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=1521)|
| 0:25:24| If we sacrifice our precious freedoms for temporary security, we will lose both.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=1524)|
| 0:25:29| Pennsylvania Judge William Stickman wrote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=1529)|
| 0:25:32| The liberties predicted by the Constitution are not fair-weather freedoms,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=1532)|
| 0:25:35| in place when times are good, but able to cast aside in times of trouble.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=1535)|
| 0:25:39| There is no question that this country has faced, and will face, emergencies of every sort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=1539)|
| 0:25:45| He added that the solution to the crisis can never be permitted to supersede| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=1545)|
| 0:25:49| the commitment to individual liberty that stands as the foundation of the American experiment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=1549)|
| 0:25:55| And furthermore, he said the Constitution cannot accept the concept of a new normal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=1555)|
| 0:26:00| where the basic liberties of the people can be subordinated to open-ended emergency mitigation measures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=1560)|
| 0:26:07| I find it difficult to understand why some of you hesitate to dissolve the Board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=1567)|
| 0:26:11| because you're concerned about unintended consequences.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=1571)|
| 0:26:15| Why? Is it because of their expertise?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=1575)|
| 0:26:19| Since WEND is a lung doctor, an emergency room doctor, a nursing professor, a school nurse,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=1579)|
| 0:26:24| a pharmacist, a dentist, and a veterinarian qualify as medical experts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=1584)|
| 0:26:29| As far as I know, none of them are certified in public health.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=1589)|
| 0:26:32| Yet these so-called medical experts have unchecked authority regarding public health.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=1592)|
| 0:26:37| While you're thinking about unintended consequences of dissolving the Board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=1597)|
| 0:26:40| think about consequences of leaving them in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=1600)|
| 0:26:44| Do not wait for litigation to do the right thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=1604)|
| 0:26:46| Do the right thing now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=1606)|
| 0:26:48| Dissolve the Board of Health.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=1608)|
| 0:26:50| Thank you for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=1610)|
| 0:26:52| Ms. Garrett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=1612)|
| 0:26:56| In this order, I'm going to call Andrew Flores, Charity McNish, Christine Cruz,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=1616)|
| 0:27:01| Annika Jenkins, and Edward Patrick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=1621)|
| 0:27:04| Mr. Flores, are you with us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=1624)|
| 0:27:06| If you would, please take the podium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=1626)|
| 0:27:08| I'd ask those folks that are near the podium, if you would, please lower your signs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=1628)|
| 0:27:12| so we can see Mr. Flores during his talk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=1632)|
| 0:27:15| You have five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=1635)|
| 0:27:16| Please state your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=1636)|
| 0:27:19| All right, that's Andrew Flores.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=1639)|
| 0:27:21| Excuse me, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=1641)|
| 0:27:22| Please do not cover up the screen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=1642)|
| 0:27:24| Sorry about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=1644)|
| 0:27:25| Do you want to make sure?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=1645)|
| 0:27:27| Mr. Flores, you have five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=1647)|
| 0:27:29| Please state your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=1649)|
| 0:27:31| That's Andrew Flores, 1011 Lancewood Drive, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37920.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=1651)|
| 0:27:38| Commissioners, I come before you tonight unsure that you understand the gravity of the decision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=1658)|
| 0:27:42| that we are asking you to make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=1662)|
| 0:27:45| I hope to give you some context from the following thoughts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=1665)|
| 0:27:48| On September 21st, we watched as a balcony filled with unmasked citizens| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=1668)|
| 0:27:52| who came to voice their opposition to the Board of Health.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=1672)|
| 0:27:55| We came to protect the individual rights and freedoms of the citizens of Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=1675)|
| 0:27:59| from the overreach of the Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=1679)|
| 0:28:01| We did not say that the people appointed to the Board of Health were evil, unqualified, or unprofessional.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=1681)|
| 0:28:07| We said that the Board of Health had been issued too much power,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=1687)|
| 0:28:10| and we asked you to take away that power by bringing them under the oversight of the Board of Commissioners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=1690)|
| 0:28:15| or by dissolving them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=1695)|
| 0:28:17| We watched the Board of Health meeting Wednesday and listened to their legal counsel say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=1697)|
| 0:28:22| that the county could not issue an ordinance limiting their power as their powers come from the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=1702)|
| 0:28:28| We watched as the Board of Health did not consider the individual rights of the citizens,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=1708)|
| 0:28:33| but only asked if the county could curb their power.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=1713)|
| 0:28:36| After they confirmed that you, the legislative body, could not limit their powers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=1716)|
| 0:28:43| they eased a bit and ended their meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=1723)|
| 0:28:45| There are some powerful people in the city of Knoxville who have posted a video or videos on social media| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=1725)|
| 0:28:52| asking people to support the Board of Health.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=1732)|
| 0:28:55| These people do not want the Board of Health to come under the authority of the legislative body of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=1735)|
| 0:29:03| They do not want the mayor of Knox County to have authority over the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=1743)|
| 0:29:08| They do not want to limit the power of the board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=1748)|
| 0:29:11| and therefore relinquish the authority of each citizen to self-govern their health, freedom, and liberties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=1751)|
| 0:29:17| It is not in their best interest for the Board of Health to be dissolved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=1757)|
| 0:29:23| as it strips away their power and their influence as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=1763)|
| 0:29:28| Any time in history when a group of individuals is given unchecked power and authority| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=1768)|
| 0:29:33| to govern the people without recourse, disaster soon follows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=1773)|
| 0:29:37| As we have seen or will see, if they are left unchecked, the economy will suffer irreparable damage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=1777)|
| 0:29:43| either by lawsuits against the county or business closures and unemployment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=1783)|
| 0:29:48| This is a fight for our county to save our county and our citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=1788)|
| 0:29:53| It appears that your only option is to dissolve the board as they retain their power| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=1793)|
| 0:29:58| even if the governor's executive orders expire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=1798)|
| 0:30:01| They will not stop imposing mandates and stripping the liberties and freedoms of the citizens| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=1801)|
| 0:30:06| until the citizens comply with the orders no matter how much they infringe on our constitutional rights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=1806)|
| 0:30:12| And I cannot say this enough, a pandemic does not void a citizen's constitutional rights| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=1812)|
| 0:30:18| as evidenced by the ruling out of Pennsylvania.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=1818)|
| 0:30:22| I believe that you should choose to dissolve the Board of Health| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=1822)|
| 0:30:26| and can create a committee to oversee the funding and give oversight to the Health Department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=1826)|
| 0:30:31| in the interim as you explore the best way to move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=1831)|
| 0:30:34| There is no excuse for allowing the constitutional and God-given rights of the citizens that you represent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=1834)|
| 0:30:41| to continue to be stripped away by the Board of Health for even one minute more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=1841)|
| 0:30:46| We call on you to give us justice and restore the balance of power in Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=1846)|
| 0:30:51| by making a resolution to dissolve the Board of Health at this meeting tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=1851)|
| 0:30:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=1856)|
| 0:30:58| Thank you, Mr. Flores.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=1858)|
| 0:31:03| Charity McNish, please make yourself known by raising your hand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=1863)|
| 0:31:07| Charity McNish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=1867)|
| 0:31:10| Going once, going twice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=1870)|
| 0:31:12| She's right here. Unfortunately, my name was left off the list and she would like me to speak in her stead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=1872)|
| 0:31:17| Charity McNish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=1877)|

| 0:31:26| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=1886)|

| 0:32:01| What is it with this 11 o'clock bar and restaurant curfew?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=1921)|
| 0:32:05| Since the Board of Health is so driven by science, what is the scientific data that has been presented that COVID-19 germ gets stronger after 1059 p.m.?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=1925)|
| 0:32:16| By making the curfew earlier, it doesn't prevent people from going out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=1936)|
| 0:32:20| It just makes them show up earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=1940)|
| 0:32:23| Please remove such a silly restriction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=1943)|
| 0:32:26| The stupid virus can't tell time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=1946)|
| 0:32:30| And another thing, we're supposed to wear a mask when we go into the restaurant, when we walk through the restaurant, into our table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=1950)|
| 0:32:37| Then we can take it off to eat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=1957)|
| 0:32:39| When did this germ get so smart and so polite that it'll wait for me to finish my cheeseburger before infecting me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=1959)|
| 0:32:48| These foolish restrictions are killing our service industry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=1968)|
| 0:32:51| They're abusing our service staff, and in turn, they're hurting our farmers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=1971)|
| 0:32:56| These people want to work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=1976)|

| 0:33:17| 655,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=1997)|
| 0:33:20| If we're being mandated to wear a mask because of only 200,000 deaths, why are we not mandating the banning of cigarettes in order to protect 655,000?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=2000)|
| 0:33:33| You want to protect people from a virus with a 99% survivability rate, but not from lung cancer, secondhand smoke, or COPD?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=2013)|
| 0:33:43| What's the logic and science in that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=2023)|
| 0:33:46| Speaking of science, those of us who don't want to wear a mask keep hearing we are not using science.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=2026)|
| 0:33:53| My wife has quoted science information to you for weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=2033)|
| 0:33:57| I just quoted you statistics based on science from the exact same source that everybody else is using, the CDC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=2037)|
| 0:34:05| Just because you choose not to accept it, listen to it, or acknowledge it doesn't make it any less true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=2045)|
| 0:34:12| The United States was founded on the premise of freedom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=2052)|
| 0:34:15| Freedom of religion, freedom to follow any political party, freedom to put pineapple on your damn pizza.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=2055)|
| 0:34:22| That diversity is what makes this country great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=2062)|
| 0:34:24| We're not going around demanding everybody else take off their mask, and we're sure hearing from other people to put one on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=2064)|
| 0:34:31| We're only asking for us to decide for ourselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=2071)|
| 0:34:35| Oh, and here's a fun fact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=2075)|
| 0:34:37| People in Japan, China, and Taiwan, yeah, they've been wearing masks since the 1950s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=2077)|
| 0:34:43| And guess where the virus originated? In China.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=2083)|
| 0:34:47| Don't believe me? Look it up yourself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=2087)|
| 0:34:51| In closing, I respectfully ask you to revoke the code establishing the non-elected board or just lift this mandate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=2091)|
| 0:34:58| Thank you, and God bless America.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=2098)|

| 0:35:26| Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=2126)|
| 0:35:28| There's a great philosophical divide about who is right and who is wrong in this debate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=2128)|
| 0:35:33| about whether to retain or dissolve the Knoxville County Board of Health.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=2133)|
| 0:35:37| Each side stands vehemently behind their position and beliefs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=2137)|
| 0:35:41| The scientific debate, however, is not the issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=2141)|
| 0:35:45| Due process is the issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=2145)|
| 0:35:47| Ronald Reagan once said, quote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=2147)|
| 0:35:51| The most terrifying words in the English language are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=2151)|
| 0:35:54| I'm from the government and I'm here to help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=2154)|
| 0:35:59| There's a process of checks and balances which protects its citizens from a tyrannical government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=2159)|
| 0:36:04| We are here to ask the commission to respect the process that has worked for 244 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=2164)|
| 0:36:10| If people want mandates, increased restrictions, curfews to continue, draft a bill, bring it to a vote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=2170)|
| 0:36:16| let the people decide at the ballot box.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=2176)|
| 0:36:19| This way, the appointed authorities do not feel unsafe or threatened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=2179)|
| 0:36:24| It's a fair process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=2184)|
| 0:36:26| We are here to ask the commission to limit the government's power lawfully and peacefully.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=2186)|
| 0:36:30| In response to the Board of Health's claims of threats by our group,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=2190)|
| 0:36:34| I challenge any member of the Board of Health to provide evidence of a threat against them or a family member.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=2194)|
| 0:36:40| Our group does not condone or act or does not condone any act of violence against members of the board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=2200)|
| 0:36:46| or any other member of the community without exception.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=2206)|
| 0:36:50| Any individual found of making such threats needs to be held accountable and punished to the fullest extent of the law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=2210)|
| 0:36:56| Business owners who have lost their livelihoods are the real victims,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=2216)|
| 0:36:59| not the Board of Health members who have been paid without interruption throughout this pandemic and shutdown,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=2219)|
| 0:37:06| unlike the business owners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=2226)|
| 0:37:08| This is not Ebola or HIV.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=2228)|
| 0:37:11| After almost 40 years, HIV still has no vaccine,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=2231)|
| 0:37:15| yet the world was not shut down when HIV was introduced in the late 70s, early 80s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=2235)|
| 0:37:23| Several board members have expressed their fear of attending tonight's meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=2243)|
| 0:37:28| The one I find most abhorrent is the statement from Dr. O'Brien.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=2248)|
| 0:37:33| He claimed to fear the opposition, yet as a vet, quote, I have dealt with worse with ISIS, end quote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=2253)|
| 0:37:39| Thank you, sir, for your service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=2259)|
| 0:37:41| If you're here tonight and thank you, Mayor Jacobs, for offering to escort any member of the board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=2261)|
| 0:37:48| so they had the opportunity to be here to ensure everybody's safety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=2268)|
| 0:37:54| So I am confused if Dr. O'Brien is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=2274)|
| 0:37:58| I would just like to ask him how an officer of such high rank and long service| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=2278)|
| 0:38:02| equate a peacefully assembled group engaged in the democratic process with a group of vicious terrorists.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=2282)|
| 0:38:09| I wonder what Kayla Mueller's family would think of that statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=2289)|
| 0:38:14| Thank you, Mayor Jacobs, as I said, for offering to escort any member who wished to be here safely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=2294)|
| 0:38:20| The allegations against our group are unfounded without a shred of evidence until proven otherwise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=2300)|
| 0:38:25| For the record, Mayor Jacobs had nothing to do with the formation of our group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=2305)|
| 0:38:29| The administrators of our group decided there was a need when the mass mandates were forced on us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=2309)|
| 0:38:34| So as of today, we have about 2,000 members, and it's growing by the day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=2314)|
| 0:38:39| People who have been afraid to speak out because they were afraid that they would be singled out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=2319)|
| 0:38:43| and bullied by the Board of Health and their enforcers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=2323)|
| 0:38:48| So I've been personally attacked on social media when Larson Jade posted a question on Facebook| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=2328)|
| 0:38:57| about what would you say if you could speak directly to the Board of Health.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=2337)|
| 0:39:02| And I posted my comments based on logic and fact and research.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=2342)|
| 0:39:06| And a woman who was expressing her opinion, which opposed mine, stated she replied that she hopes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=2346)|
| 0:39:17| a plumber does my next colonoscopy. Your stupidity is showing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=2357)|
| 0:39:23| The point is, when the opposition cannot win a debate fairly using facts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=2363)|
| 0:39:29| they attack, they attempt to intimidate, and they claim victim status, as is the case of the Board of Health.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=2369)|
| 0:39:37| Despite constant attacks by the Board of Health members against Mayor Jacobs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=2377)|
| 0:39:41| his position of addressing the needs of the entire community is what the citizens elected him to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=2381)|
| 0:39:46| which supports my claim that he is the only responsible member of the Board of Health,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=2386)|
| 0:39:50| and that's the one that was elected by the people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=2390)|
| 0:39:54| So I ask the commission to dissolve the Knox County Board of Health effective immediately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=2394)|
| 0:39:58| To the commission, as we ask you to make these decisions for our entire community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=2398)|
| 0:40:01| please consider the advice of Colonel Keith Nightingale,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=2401)|
| 0:40:04| commander of the 3rd Brigade, 82nd Airborne in Vietnam, when he, historian, quote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=2404)|

| 0:40:13| Remember your basic human values. If you forget them or allow others to forget them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=2413)|
| 0:40:18| you forfeit your purpose and why we exist as a nation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=2418)|
| 0:40:21| Final comment. If the commission is concerned with how this vote will affect their future political career, remember this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=2421)|
| 0:40:27| If you vote to continue to allow the Knoxville Board of Health unchecked and unlimited power,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=2427)|
| 0:40:31| you are voting to relinquish your future power to the entity you created and enabled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=2431)|
| 0:40:36| Thank you, Ms. Cruz.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=2436)|
| 0:40:43| I have one mistake on my list. Dr. Denise Sibley, are you with us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=2443)|

| 0:40:54| Denise Sibley will be next and then followed by Annika Jenkins, Edward Patrick, Kathleen Marquardt,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=2454)|
| 0:41:01| Michael Whittleson, and Jonathan Dunham.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=2461)|
| 0:41:04| If you would, please state your name and your address for the record. You have five minutes to address the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=2464)|
| 0:41:08| Thank you. My name is Dr. Denise Sibley. I'm from Johnson City, Tennessee, 3509 Bondwood Circle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=2468)|
| 0:41:16| The reason I drove here today as a physician is to speak to you about freedom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=2476)|
| 0:41:23| I have been investigating extensively the data for Tennessee and actually have run the data for Knox County as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=2483)|
| 0:41:33| And these are as of Saturday night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=2493)|
| 0:41:36| I am concerned that the fear that has been put out has served to take away our freedoms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=2496)|
| 0:41:46| and that there is really not a scientific basis to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=2506)|
| 0:41:50| And even that there is deception within the medical community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=2510)|
| 0:41:55| There is a narrative that is accepted and those who go against the narrative are canceled or shut down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=2515)|
| 0:42:03| I am an independent physician. I have a concierge private practice, so no one can fire me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=2523)|
| 0:42:10| But I personally began to see the deception in March when I was not allowed to call in hydroxychloroquine for two patients.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=2530)|
| 0:42:20| It was denied at Walgreens and at Walmart because I gave the COVID diagnosis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=2540)|
| 0:42:28| And it was at that point that in my brain I started to say, what is going on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=2548)|
| 0:42:34| This has never happened to me in 39 years of prescribing a $6 medication,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=2554)|
| 0:42:40| which I have given to many people for malaria prophylaxis for travel, to my friends, my patients, for rheumatoid diseases,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=2560)|
| 0:42:49| and have written hundreds of prescriptions of hydroxychloroquine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=2569)|
| 0:42:55| So that was my beginning of deception.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=2575)|
| 0:42:58| Along with that, there have been two retracted studies from the Holy Bible of medical profession| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=2578)|
| 0:43:07| that have been retracted from the Lancet and the New England Journal of Medicine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=2587)|
| 0:43:12| because those studies of COVID were false. They were falsified data.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=2592)|
| 0:43:18| So my own profession I have seen succumb to deception.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=2598)|
| 0:43:25| And it's the first time in my 39 years, having been trained at University of Virginia, that I've ever seen this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=2605)|
| 0:43:33| And I took care of many AIDS patients.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=2613)|
| 0:43:35| I was afraid of AIDS patients because that was 100 percent mortality rate if I stuck myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=2615)|
| 0:43:43| This has a death rate of 0.03 percent in Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=2623)|
| 0:43:50| That means that 99.97 percent of Tennesseans are not dying of COVID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=2630)|
| 0:43:57| This is the first time in my 39 years of medicine that healthy people have been masked for any respiratory viral illness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=2637)|
| 0:44:06| There is no precedence of this response to a disease of any respiratory disease,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=2646)|
| 0:44:13| influenza included, and especially one that has such low mortality.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=2653)|
| 0:44:18| In Knox County alone, there have been, and this is as of Saturday, 80 deaths over 191 days as of March 22nd| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=2658)|
| 0:44:29| when the first death occurred in Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=2669)|
| 0:44:31| You have a population of 470,343 people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=2671)|
| 0:44:38| So your death rate is 0.017.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=2678)|
| 0:44:44| Let's compare that to the death rates of other things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=2684)|
| 0:44:47| Death from accidental death in Knox County is five times higher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=2687)|
| 0:44:52| We should ban all ATVs, all ladders, anything that would bring you an accidental death.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=2692)|
| 0:45:00| The motor vehicle occupancy death rate is higher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=2700)|
| 0:45:03| The suicide rate is higher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=2703)|
| 0:45:07| There are 13 people that die every day in your county, and that's an average of all causes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=2707)|
| 0:45:15| So that over 191 days, the expected deaths are 2,499.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=2715)|
| 0:45:24| That means that 3.2% of your deaths in Knox County over the last 191 days of counting COVID have actually been attributed to COVID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=2724)|
| 0:45:39| And we would preface that by saying that even the CDC said that only 6% of deaths are due to COVID alone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=2739)|
| 0:45:47| So we must take those mortality rates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=2747)|
| 0:45:51| They may be lower.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=2751)|
| 0:45:53| I would say to you that Tennesseans have the freedom to decide for themselves with their own adult brain whether to wear a mask,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=2753)|
| 0:46:04| whether a mask is effective, whether there are hazards to a mask, which there are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=2764)|
| 0:46:11| so that we can use our own intelligence to decide rather than having it forced on us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=2771)|
| 0:46:19| Thank you, Dr. Sibley. Your time is up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=2779)|
| 0:46:21| Thank you very much for joining us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=2781)|
| 0:46:23| Ms. Annika Jenkins, are you with us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=2783)|
| 0:46:30| Please state your name and your address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=2790)|
| 0:46:32| You have five minutes to address commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=2792)|
| 0:46:34| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=2794)|
| 0:46:35| My name is Annika Jenkins, and I'm only going to give my zip code 37934 out of fear of safety, and I'm going to address that during my speech.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=2795)|
| 0:46:44| So I want to talk about how the Board of Health is using fear as propaganda, and they are using it to cripple our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=2804)|
| 0:46:52| Families are not seeing each other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=2812)|
| 0:46:54| They are not hugging each other at funerals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=2814)|
| 0:46:57| Kids can't be friends with each other anymore because they won't wear masks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=2817)|
| 0:47:02| There's absolutely no shaking hands, singing, or hugging at church.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=2822)|
| 0:47:07| The data is over 99% survival rate for those under 70, according to the CDC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=2827)|
| 0:47:15| Now, you are asking me and my family to trust those who keep changing the criteria.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=2835)|
| 0:47:23| I've been watching the press conferences from Martha Buchanan every Tuesday and Thursday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=2843)|
| 0:47:29| Last week, she talked about, now we're going to use the words probable cases or potential exposure or quality exposure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=2849)|
| 0:47:41| So we continue to change the criteria.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=2861)|
| 0:47:44| What happened to just positive or negative tests?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=2864)|
| 0:47:47| The information that is on the websites for the news is adding on top of each other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=2867)|
| 0:47:52| You are not providing and reporting the accurate information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=2872)|
| 0:47:57| You are continuing to propagate fear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=2877)|
| 0:48:00| Last Thursday at the press conference, Charity Manifee stated that even though there's less than a 1% fatality rate, that's not what Knox County is shooting for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=2880)|
| 0:48:11| How are you ever going to get to 100% survival rate with a virus?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=2891)|
| 0:48:16| This is ridiculous that you, again, are using fear to propagate and have propaganda within the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=2896)|
| 0:48:25| Last Tuesday, Martha Buchanan talked about how they don't track testing by age group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=2905)|
| 0:48:31| Well, then how do they move schools to the red?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=2911)|
| 0:48:34| That doesn't make any sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=2914)|
| 0:48:36| We're not going to track by age group, but yet we're going to shut down Hulls High School for two weeks, but we can't really prove by age group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=2916)|
| 0:48:45| Again, the criteria continues to change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=2925)|
| 0:48:48| She also talked about risky behaviors, and she talked about wearing a mask to the shower in your own house because then you can contract COVID-19 with the house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=2928)|
| 0:49:00| She also talked about the workplace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=2940)|
| 0:49:03| This is a quote from her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=2943)|
| 0:49:04| Someone takes off their mask to eat lunch, and then everyone else contracts COVID-19.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=2944)|
| 0:49:10| When are we going to be reasonable?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=2950)|
| 0:49:12| This is getting to be ridiculous for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=2952)|
| 0:49:15| The other thing I want to talk about is the Knox County Health Department still meets via Zoom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=2955)|
| 0:49:20| If masks are okay, why are they meeting via Zoom?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=2960)|
| 0:49:25| The other thing I want to address and the reason I want to talk about safety is because I am disgusted that Patrick O'Brien used the term ISIS,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=2965)|
| 0:49:34| and then what the Knox County Board of Health is doing is they are accepting and encouraging bullying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=2974)|
| 0:49:41| I don't know if anyone saw the sign that was at Bearden Middle School that said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=2981)|
| 0:49:46| don't be a COVID idiot, wear a mask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=2986)|
| 0:49:49| Oh, that's okay now that at schools we can call each other idiots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=2989)|
| 0:49:53| I hope each and every one of you are telling your kids, it's okay, let's call each other idiots like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=2993)|
| 0:49:59| You just said, Larson Jay just said at the beginning of this meeting that we should show each other, we should be kind, and we should show grace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=2999)|
| 0:50:07| How are we doing that when people are attacking our group on social media and calling us terrorists?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=3007)|
| 0:50:14| Because we stand up for the Constitution? Because we stand up for the Declaration of Independence?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=3014)|
| 0:50:20| I will not, I will not take direction from a Board of Health that has lost all credibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=3020)|
| 0:50:27| They are not my family doctor. I don't trust them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=3027)|
| 0:50:30| Again, I cannot believe that they encourage bullying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=3030)|
| 0:50:34| I want to read from the Declaration of Independence, and I want each and every one of you commissioners to pay close attention,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=3034)|
| 0:50:40| that to secure these rights, governments are instituted among men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=3040)|
| 0:50:48| that whenever any form of government becomes destructive of these ends,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=3048)|
| 0:50:52| it is the right of the people to alter or to abolish it and to institute new government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=3052)|
| 0:50:59| You all need to understand, if you do not have integrity and stand up and support the citizens of Knox County that you promise to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=3059)|
| 0:51:08| we will change government. We have the right. This is still America.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=3068)|
| 0:51:13| The Declaration of Independence and the Constitution was created under one creator,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=3073)|
| 0:51:18| the creator that I listen to, the creator that my family listens to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=3078)|
| 0:51:22| I will not listen to the Board of Health.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=3082)|
| 0:51:26| Thank you, Ms. Jenkins. Mr. Patrick, in the on-deck circle after Mr. Patrick will be Kathleen Marquardt, Michael Whittleson,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=3086)|
| 0:51:39| Jonathan Dunham, and Rebecca Reeves. Mr. Patrick, I understand you have a visual impairment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=3099)|
| 0:51:46| and I will let you know when you're at the one-minute mark remaining.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=3106)|
| 0:51:50| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=3110)|
| 0:51:51| Please state your name and address for the record, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=3111)|
| 0:51:53| My name is Edward Patrick. My address is Volunteer Landing Lane, Knoxville, 37915.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=3113)|
| 0:52:01| A point of order. I understood that everybody below decks was going to wear a mask, so if you'll allow me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=3121)|
| 0:52:12| I'm reluctant to put my tissue on the loudspeaker system, but very well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=3132)|
| 0:52:20| Very well. Thank you for the opportunity to speak with you tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=3140)|
| 0:52:24| If we had a national crisis where there was an invasion by an armed force,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=3144)|
| 0:52:32| we would call out our armed forces to fight the enemy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=3152)|
| 0:52:39| And if we had anarchists and extremists of any type, left or right, in Knox County, as they do have in some other places,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=3159)|
| 0:52:52| we would expect and call for our police and our sheriff to fight the enemy, but we have an invisible virus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=3172)|
| 0:53:04| So I want to keep repeating, the virus is the enemy. The virus is the enemy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=3184)|
| 0:53:13| Conversely, the Board of Health, although we have heard passionate denunciations tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=3193)|
| 0:53:20| the Board of Health, in my opinion, is not the enemy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=3200)|
| 0:53:26| The armed forces cannot fight the virus. The sheriff's office cannot fight the virus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=3206)|
| 0:53:34| Some years back, in this conservative state, there were a conservative governor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=3214)|
| 0:53:44| conservative legislatures, perhaps conservative county commissions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=3224)|
| 0:53:48| that established boards of health specifically to fight the enemy that we are now fighting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=3228)|
| 0:53:56| And I think that's the group that should fight the enemy, not the army, not the politicians, not the lawyers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=3236)|
| 0:54:07| God forbid. I was a lawyer for 35 years or more, so I know the lawyers shouldn't fight a virus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=3247)|
| 0:54:14| I know nothing about a virus, but the Board of Health consists of professionals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=3254)|
| 0:54:21| and who else would you want to fight the virus?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=3261)|
| 0:54:26| From what I am hearing, we want passionate political theorists and independent thinkers, in quotes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=3266)|
| 0:54:35| who believe that they should fight the virus by talking to their private doctors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=3275)|
| 0:54:41| I want people to listen to the Board of Health and follow the Board of Health.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=3281)|
| 0:54:48| That's what I'm asking, and with respect to the particular situations at hand here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=3288)|
| 0:54:55| there are two resolutions, as I understand it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=3295)|
| 0:54:58| I certainly have no objection to having a citizen board member. I think that's a good idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=3298)|
| 0:55:04| With respect to the second, which I understand expresses displeasure by the county commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=3304)|
| 0:55:11| on the actions of the Board of Health, I would prefer that you said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=3311)|
| 0:55:16| certainly at the very least, in an intro, that the county commission respects the Board of Health| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=3316)|
| 0:55:24| and its efforts to fight the enemy virus, but in particular, and if you have particular issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=3324)|
| 0:55:31| I'm talking about the fundamentals here. Fundamentally, the virus is the enemy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=3331)|
| 0:55:39| and the Board of Health was specifically designed to fight this kind of enemy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=3339)|
| 0:55:45| In particular, you can argue one way or the other about a particular decision, but I respect them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=3345)|
| 0:55:52| We've watched them regularly, and every one of them is impressive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=3352)|
| 0:55:57| One minute, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=3357)|
| 0:55:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=3358)|
| 0:55:59| So I would urge people to watch them on TV, not through the lens of passion and intensity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=3359)|
| 0:56:07| I'd like to lower the temperature here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=3367)|
| 0:56:09| My gosh, it's really almost abusive what's going on here about the Board of Health,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=3369)|
| 0:56:17| and they have been getting horrific, insulting, belittling, degrading, threatening,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=3377)|
| 0:56:23| intimidating voicemails, emails, anonymous snarky comments on social media.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=3383)|
| 0:56:30| These people are not getting paid anything, and they deserve our respect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=3390)|
| 0:56:37| So that's what I'm asking for this commission to at least endorse the efforts of the Board of Health,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=3397)|
| 0:56:46| and in particular, if you have a disagreement with the Board of Health, then raise that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=3406)|
| 0:56:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=3411)|
| 0:56:52| Thank you, Mr. Patrick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=3412)|
| 0:56:56| Kathleen Marquardt, are you with us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=3416)|
| 0:56:58| If you would, please raise your hand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=3418)|
| 0:57:00| Coming up next will be Michael Whittleson, Jonathan Dunham, Rebecca Reeves, Annabelle Henley, and Allie Haney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=3420)|
| 0:57:08| Kathleen Marquardt, please state your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=3428)|
| 0:57:12| You have five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=3432)|
| 0:57:14| I'm Kathleen Marquardt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=3434)|
| 0:57:15| My address is 1207 Viking Drive, Knoxville, 37932.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=3435)|
| 0:57:23| Now, you all have, what, approximately a half a million people that you are responsible for the health and welfare for in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=3443)|
| 0:57:37| When you were given this directive from the governor to consider masks and shutting down businesses or restricting them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=3457)|
| 0:57:50| did you study both the efficacy and the safety of masks before you did this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=3470)|
| 0:57:59| Did you study any of this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=3479)|
| 0:58:02| Because you know all the figures we've been getting from Fauci, Dr. Fauci, the CDC, they keep waffling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=3482)|
| 0:58:12| Wear a mask, don't wear a mask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=3492)|
| 0:58:14| We don't need a mask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=3494)|
| 0:58:15| Need a mask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=3495)|
| 0:58:17| Masks don't work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=3497)|
| 0:58:18| Masks work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=3498)|
| 0:58:22| You're supposed to be changing your masks every 20 minutes with fresh ones, and I haven't seen any of you change them out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=3502)|
| 0:58:36| If you research the efficacy of masks, you would realize that viruses are smaller than any of the pores, any of the holes on any of the masks you're wearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=3516)|
| 0:58:50| So they're really not effective for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=3530)|
| 0:58:53| But I'd rather speak to you right now about the safety of masks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=3533)|
| 0:58:59| People who are obese, diabetic, women who are pregnant, children, people with other issues, people who are recovering from cancer or who have cancer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=3539)|
| 0:59:19| there are so many people that should not ever be wearing a mask, and masks were designed to be used in an operating room where there's extra oxygen being pumped in constantly so people do not get hypoxia.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=3559)|
| 0:59:40| All the people that are wearing masks are damaging their bodies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=3580)|
| 0:59:44| They're damaging their hearts, their lungs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=3584)|
| 0:59:47| They're reducing their length of life, and when we start telling two-year-olds on up, said the CDC, need to start wearing masks, that is so wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=3587)|
| 1:00:04| We are endangering their lives, and everybody who's wearing a mask is breathing back in the garbage that our lungs are trying to get rid of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=3604)|
| 1:00:15| You're breathing it back in, and by the way, it goes to your brains.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=3615)|
| 1:00:21| You need to understand, even healthy people wearing masks down the road are going to be dying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=3621)|
| 1:00:29| They're going to be getting heart attacks and arrhythmia.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=3629)|
| 1:00:33| Have you done the research on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=3633)|
| 1:00:37| There's plenty of research out there from CDC and everything else, and there's nothing that says masks are safe or necessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=3637)|
| 1:00:48| I think you need to do the research because you're making these decisions for people and do not understand how damaging they are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=3648)|
| 1:00:59| It's time for you to do your research.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=3659)|
| 1:01:02| I question any of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=3662)|
| 1:01:04| Have you researched these issues before you sat down and made that decision?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=3664)|
| 1:01:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=3670)|

| 1:01:23| Mr. Widdowson, if you would please state your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=3683)|
| 1:01:27| You have five minutes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=3687)|
| 1:01:29| My name is Mike Widdowson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=3689)|
| 1:01:31| I'm a resident of 9915 Fleener Mill Road, High School, Tennessee, 37754.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=3691)|
| 1:01:36| I'm speaking here tonight to voice my concern of the actions taken by the Knox County Board of Health and the power and authority of which it currently possesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=3696)|
| 1:01:46| No matter what position is taken on the political spectrum, it should be concerning to us as citizens to have entities within our government consisting of non-elected officials| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=3706)|
| 1:01:56| which possess great authority, allowing creation of mandates which restrict civil liberties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=3716)|
| 1:02:03| It should be disturbing to us as citizens that these entities have the ability to impose penalties such as fines and confinement to punish and coerce us into compliance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=3723)|
| 1:02:14| It should also be infuriating to us as citizens that these entities which can have the capability to accomplish these acts without the use of the legislative process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=3734)|
| 1:02:24| which is conducted by the elected officials that are held accountable to the people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=3744)|
| 1:02:29| Last week, the Board of Health demonstrated its refusal to be accountable to those people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=3749)|
| 1:02:35| In an effort to panhandle the public for sympathy and emotional support, the Board exploited the intent of a video involving Mayor Jacobs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=3755)|
| 1:02:43| to form a claim that it makes them fear for their safety to be present in a public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=3763)|
| 1:02:50| Such a convenient excuse to not hear grievances from the people negatively affected by the mandates in person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=3770)|
| 1:02:58| To this Board, I say this, my rights are more important than your feelings because I actually fought for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=3778)|
| 1:03:06| I'm a retired veteran that served over 20 years as a Green Beret.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=3786)|
| 1:03:11| During my career, I deployed 11 times to combat zones in various hostile areas around the world to include Kosovo, Iraq, and Syria.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=3791)|
| 1:03:18| I have participated in humanitarian efforts. I have fought in direct combat against insurgents and terrorist organizations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=3798)|
| 1:03:26| I've also witnessed the moments when the price of freedom was paid as my own personal friends and fellow American soldiers became heroes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=3806)|
| 1:03:33| by giving the ultimate sacrifice in service to our country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=3813)|
| 1:03:37| That sacrifice was made to ensure that we, the people, can retain our many freedoms, one of which is the ability to control our own government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=3817)|
| 1:03:45| It was not to surrender our liberties in the midst of a temporary crisis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=3825)|
| 1:03:50| It was not to have our representatives whom we elected rendered impotent and unable to act in the best interest of the entire community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=3830)|
| 1:03:59| Our founding fathers gave us a republic for as long as we could keep it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=3839)|
| 1:04:03| To do that, we as responsible citizens must demand nothing less than liberty at our local level of government| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=3843)|
| 1:04:09| because if we do not, we will not receive it at our state and federal levels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=3849)|
| 1:04:15| In closing, the Knox County Board of Health, or any other bureaucratic entity for that matter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=3855)|
| 1:04:21| should not possess such great a power to make law-abiding citizens into criminals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=3861)|
| 1:04:27| Bureaucracy should only be empowered to make recommendations for the regulations based off their field of expertise and subject matter knowledge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=3867)|
| 1:04:36| These recommendations should then be presented to our elected officials to exercise the democratic process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=3876)|
| 1:04:43| This way, comprehensive consideration can be given to find a solution of situations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=3883)|
| 1:04:50| and give the burden of accountability and recourse placed upon the shoulders of the people that we elected to do the job,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=3890)|
| 1:04:58| thus ensuring that people remain in control and that we remain to be called volunteers and not voluntolds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=3898)|
| 1:05:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=3905)|

| 1:05:15| It will be Rebecca Reeves, Annabelle Henley, Allie Haney, Debbie Stafford, and Chris Irwin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=3915)|
| 1:05:21| Mr. Dunham, you have five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=3921)|
| 1:05:22| Please state your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=3922)|
| 1:05:25| My name is Jonathan Dunham, and having had a price on my head in Iraq, it's not really an experience I care to repeat,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=3925)|

| 1:07:04| This board of wannabe oligarchs also violates our right to peacefully assemble| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=4024)|

| 1:07:21| These arbitrary restrictions have caused immeasurable harm to those Americans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=4041)|

| 1:07:38| To make matters worse, the Board of Health voted to exempt themselves| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=4058)|

| 1:08:19| but also of those with whom it disagrees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=4099)|
| 1:08:22| What will they do if we allow them to continue?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=4102)|
| 1:08:25| Under Tennessee law, the County Commission has the ability to create or dissolve the Board of Health,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=4105)|
| 1:08:29| but not the power to regulate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=4109)|
| 1:08:32| For all these reasons, I respectfully request you dissolve the Knox County Board of Health| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=4112)|

| 1:09:27| I asked a gentleman from FEMA where all the people were.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=4167)|

| 1:31:55| the previous speaker noted, the current mandate is not actually being| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=5515)|
| 1:32:00| criminally enforced. So you can't both talk about how there is a terrible law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=5520)|
| 1:32:05| and then also not have the law be enforced and somehow think that that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=5525)|
| 1:32:09| makes you a victim. We are in a situation where there is a pandemic. It's going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=5529)|
| 1:32:14| exert certain costs on this county, and we have to deal with that. So I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=5534)|
| 1:32:22| think everybody should just sort of step back a little bit and think about the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=5542)|
| 1:32:26| fact that there's volunteers for a board that volunteered when it had no| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=5546)|
| 1:32:30| apparent power at all. They volunteered as a public service to comment on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=5550)|
| 1:32:35| budget of the Knox County Health Department. They now are thrust into a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=5555)|
| 1:32:39| situation where they do have power. That is problematic in a lot of ways, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=5559)|
| 1:32:45| that's where we are, and that's what laws are set up, and they're doing the things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=5565)|
| 1:32:48| that are required now. To suggest that those people are somehow they're seeking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=5568)|
| 1:32:54| power or, you know, want to be tyrants, I think is pretty preposterous considering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=5574)|
| 1:32:59| they volunteered for a board that had no power at the time. So yeah, I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=5579)|
| 1:33:05| everybody just needs to calm down a little bit and, you know, look at where we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=5585)|
| 1:33:10| are. The numbers that exist today are what they are because we're taking the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=5590)|
| 1:33:14| actions that we've been taking. You can't just sort of pretend| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=5594)|
| 1:33:19| everything's going to work out exactly the same way if we change all of our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=5599)|
| 1:33:22| actions. So also I think that it's important to talk a little bit about the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=5602)|
| 1:33:27| economic effects of the Board of Health's mandates. So some of these have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=5607)|
| 1:33:31| been widely discussed, others are widely ignored. They all deserve more careful| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=5611)|
| 1:33:36| discussion than they've had. Negative economic effects are cited as a reason| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=5616)|
| 1:33:39| to rein in the Board of Health, but what are these effects? Are they actually the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=5619)|
| 1:33:44| result of the Board of Health mandate, or are they the result of federal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=5624)|
| 1:33:46| regulation, or the Tennessee Pledge, or result of the pandemic itself? People| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=5626)|
| 1:33:51| have lost their jobs because of the pandemic in many cases. The Board of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=5631)|
| 1:33:55| Health has only two mandates in force currently, so let's keep that in mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=5635)|
| 1:33:58| There's a bar curfew at 11 o'clock and a mask mandate. That's it. Everything else| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=5638)|
| 1:34:04| comes from somewhere else. And so we know that the bar and restaurant curfew has a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=5644)|
| 1:34:09| large impact on a small number of bars, but we still need to quantify that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=5649)|
| 1:34:13| impact. How many bars are affected? How much revenue is lost? None of these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=5653)|
| 1:34:16| numbers are actually being thrown around. Nobody's actually talking about the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=5656)|
| 1:34:19| specifics. What about the mask mandate? What is the direct cost of the mask| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=5659)|
| 1:34:24| mandate? As far as I know, it's about a million dollars for everybody in Knox| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=5664)|
| 1:34:29| County to buy a mask. That's spread evenly across all citizens. I haven't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=5669)|
| 1:34:33| heard anything else articulated in terms of specific economic costs of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=5673)|
| 1:34:37| mandate. And what about the positive benefits of all these Board of Health| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=5677)|
| 1:34:41| mandates? The mask mandate creates a direct economic benefit. A survey by the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=5681)|
| 1:34:47| Cleveland Federal Reserve Bank found that 67% of respondents were more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=5687)|

| 1:34:55| comfortable. That's a 56% gap. If consumers are less likely to visit a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=5695)|
| 1:35:00| business when they're uncomfortable, then the mask mandate is actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=5700)|
| 1:35:04| helping business in the county. So there's also indirect benefits from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=5704)|

| 1:35:12| Numerous observational studies of cell phone data and reservations show that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=5712)|
| 1:35:16| high case counts suppress patronage of businesses. So that means growth in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=5716)|
| 1:35:22| case counts hurts local businesses. Hospitalizations and sick days also cost| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=5722)|
| 1:35:27| money. I think that overall, Knox County citizens have already racked up at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=5727)|
| 1:35:30| least $8.5 million in hospitalizations. If transmission gets worse,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=5730)|
| 1:35:35| institutions like UT and Knox County schools might have to close. That will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=5735)|
| 1:35:39| also hurt business. Eventually, stricter rules might be required to prevent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=5739)|
| 1:35:43| overwhelming hospitals, and then there will be even higher economic costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=5743)|
| 1:35:47| The Board of Health puts a lot of effort into measuring health risk and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=5747)|

| 1:36:06| consider the bigger picture, to consider economics, to consider how| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=5766)|

| 1:45:22| this. Um, and my question to you that I hope you'll ponder, um, is where do we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=6322)|
| 1:45:28| draw the line? Where is this line drawn? Um, will the Board of Health have the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=6328)|
| 1:45:34| authority to mandate the COVID-19 vaccine when it becomes available? Um,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=6334)|
| 1:45:39| this vaccine is fast tracked and no proper safety trials. And there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=6339)|
| 1:45:44| there's plenty of reasons to be concerned about this. Um, do they have?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=6344)|
| 1:45:49| Will they have that authority to mandate that just as they are with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=6349)|
| 1:45:52| masks right now for the safety of the community? Um, when do we, the people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=6352)|
| 1:45:57| get to decide what's best for our own health?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=6357)|
| 1:46:00| I know that the argument for masks is that it's not just about our individual| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=6360)|
| 1:46:04| health, but the health of the community as a whole. And I can respect this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=6364)|
| 1:46:07| notion. But I must ask, then why haven't we always worn masks to protect each| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=6367)|
| 1:46:11| other and to protect ourselves from being sick? Viruses and bacteria are not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=6371)|
| 1:46:16| going away. They've always been here and they're not going away. Um,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=6376)|
| 1:46:19| according to this logic, we should be expected to wear masks for the rest of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=6379)|
| 1:46:23| our lives wherever we go. It just doesn't make sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=6383)|

| 1:46:46| essentially do protect the community as a whole. If everyone were to adopt| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=6406)|
| 1:46:51| these, um, as their way of life, and if it's really about our health, then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=6411)|
| 1:46:56| these things should be part of the discussion. It's clear that this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=6416)|
| 1:46:59| specific issue has become politicized and that the desire to calm and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=6419)|

| 2:14:23| I'm going to give you to 7.10 before I return it to the applicant. I apologize. I should have set| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=8063)|
| 2:14:28| the time limit at the beginning. Okay, I'll make it quick then. So anyway, we've got a lot of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=8068)|
| 2:14:33| congestion, a lot of traffic, a lot of issues. Wrecks are there as well. I know in the MPC meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=8073)|
| 2:14:42| that it was never mentioned that this neighborhood was going to be using that intersection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=8082)|

| 2:14:51| takes us to Oak Ridge Highway, which therefore takes us to Hardin Valley, which therefore takes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=8091)|
| 2:14:56| us to Pellissippi and all that connection. So anyway, as far as I know, the developer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=8096)|
| 2:15:05| the builder has not met with the community to discuss that. I'm sorry, the attorney's name| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=8105)|

| 2:15:36| compacted area in there. If you go up Emery Road, we have flooding issues. We've talked about that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=8136)|
| 2:15:42| with all the other issues before, and I just, I don't have time to get into all of that. But anyway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=8142)|

| 2:15:54| that way, the Carnes community has handled the brunt of a major part of development just within| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=8154)|
| 2:16:03| our community. So far, we've been very tolerant of all the new development that's been in our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=8163)|
| 2:16:09| community. My question is, what do we get in return? What's given back to our community?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=8169)|
| 2:16:19| We have school issues. We've talked about that. Ms. Hill was just on the school board. So our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=8179)|
| 2:16:24| solution to overcrowded schools is to build a new school. Why do we have overcrowded schools?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=8184)|
| 2:16:31| We have development after development after development popping up all over the place in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=8191)|
| 2:16:37| Carnes. We can't handle it right now. The people of Carnes, I know we say we're not against| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=8197)|
| 2:16:45| development, and we're really not against development. We need progress, just like we've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=8205)|
| 2:16:50| talked about before last time I presented. We've got to have some infrastructure done. So I will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=8210)|
| 2:16:56| leave this thought for you all. Hopefully my time is getting a little bit close. Please wrap it up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=8216)|
| 2:17:02| ma'am. We need a moratorium in our area so we can take care of the issues that are directly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=8222)|
| 2:17:11| that we face directly. Each day we get out on the road and we try to get from here to there and,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=8231)|
| 2:17:17| you know, get to work, get the kids to school. We just can't handle anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=8237)|
| 2:17:23| And so anyway, I would ask that the county commission deny, postpone this development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=8243)|
| 2:17:31| until we can have something done to our community. I know Mr. Snowden, we met last time, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=8251)|
| 2:17:37| we've talked about intersections being fixed, and that's great. We're all for that. Please fix our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=8257)|
| 2:17:42| intersections because we need it. However, that's going to be a little while. These homes are going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=8262)|
| 2:17:47| to be built. They're going to be built in a very short period of time, and then you're going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=8267)|
| 2:17:52| add some more people onto an already busy road construction in our area. So I appreciate your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=8272)|

| 2:18:42| by a professional engineer, and that would be approved and reviewed by both the Municipal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=8322)|

| 2:19:02| that come from that traffic study. So I think, you know, that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=8342)|
| 2:19:10| that we're going to address the traffic out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=8350)|
| 2:19:13| and that will include the traffic the subdivision will add.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=8353)|
| 2:19:17| I don't know if, I think Knox County engineering's probably here. I don't know if they want to speak| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=8357)|
| 2:19:23| to any of this, but so the other thing to remember with this piece of property, this piece of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=8363)|
| 2:19:32| property is topography. It lays very well. That's one of the reasons we feel like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=8372)|
| 2:19:39| the density would work on this property. It's not a steep piece of property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=8379)|

| 2:19:50| Thank you, Mr. Hickey. Mr. Snow, did you have anything you wanted to add?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=8390)|
| 2:19:55| You're not required to. I'm just giving you an invitation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=8395)|
| 2:19:59| Okay, Ms. McBee, is there anything you would like to say? I'll give you one more minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=8399)|
| 2:20:07| I promise in the next item, agenda item, I'll put some times on it. Sorry about that on this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=8407)|
| 2:20:12| Yes, Ms. McBee, you're up. Yeah, you could give her a little room. Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=8412)|
| 2:20:20| Thank you. This gentleman mentioned something about the traffic and whatever traffic issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=8420)|
| 2:20:24| that were going to be taken care of by them. Can I ask and not be facetious, is he going to fix| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=8424)|

| 2:20:36| an exit that needs to be fixed on that part. And an additional by the MPC that was put on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=8436)|
| 2:20:42| zoning report, 1,417. Where do they get those numbers then if they're going to have to go back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=8442)|
| 2:20:51| and do a traffic study? But the traffic study then is going to come after if it's already approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=8451)|
| 2:20:58| So, I mean, I don't know that that's going to be beneficial to anybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=8458)|
| 2:21:03| Mr. Snowden, can you explain the planned residential process versus a regular zoning and how| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=8463)|
| 2:21:09| I believe there are extra steps involved in that process?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=8469)|
| 2:21:12| There are, and I can let Amy speak a little bit too. But I'd like to address,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=8472)|
| 2:21:16| Ryan said he had 117 lots. So, that's what we call level one traffic study. So, that would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=8476)|
| 2:21:24| only look at their access point. We wouldn't be asking them to look based on those requirements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=8484)|
| 2:21:29| for the next downstream intersection. But as far as the planned residential zone, much to what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=8489)|
| 2:21:36| Ryan has said, is once this body rezones that property or if they choose to, then it goes back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=8496)|
| 2:21:43| to Planning Commission with a concept plan and the citizens have an opportunity to look at what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=8503)|
| 2:21:48| improvements are being originated out of that traffic impact study. Our big thing we're going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=8508)|
| 2:21:54| to be looking for is line of sight at the intersection as well as any need for a turn| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=8514)|
| 2:22:01| lane or anything like that should the need arise. So, that level one study does kind of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=8521)|
| 2:22:05| focus in on more their access point than, you know, other access points along Emory Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=8525)|
| 2:22:12| Thank you, Mr. Snowden. Any comments or discussion from the commissioners?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=8532)|
| 2:22:18| Seeing none, I'll look to, sorry, Mr. Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=8538)|
| 2:22:22| Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Knox Planning, in your packet that you forwarded to us, there's a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=8542)|
| 2:22:30| submission where the backyard of a family, the flooding is all the way up to the children's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=8550)|

| 2:22:48| Hey, Commissioner Schoonmaker, can I ask a question? Is that the location upstream| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=8568)|
| 2:22:53| of the development? I don't know. They included it in the packet to us from one of the...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=8573)|
| 2:22:58| So, I believe that property, and I could be wrong, is across Emory Road opposite from this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=8578)|
| 2:23:05| development is my understanding from staff that I spoke to today about this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=8585)|
| 2:23:11| So, this development where this lady lives will have no impact from this proposed development?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=8591)|
| 2:23:18| I cannot say that, if they would have no impact or not. Those impacts are generally looked at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=8598)|
| 2:23:24| when it comes in for the concept plan and consultation with Knox County Engineering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=8604)|
| 2:23:30| Okay, and Mr. Snowden, you said that they only want to have 117 lots on their 28 acres,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=8610)|
| 2:23:38| so that that would only be 4.2 dwelling units per acre. So, if a commissioner was to make a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=8618)|
| 2:23:45| motion, they could just say 4.2 dwelling units, no more than 4.2 dwelling units per acre on this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=8625)|
| 2:23:52| piece of property then, based on the information that you were provided? So, yeah. So, I provided| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=8632)|
| 2:24:00| that to Mr. Snowden. That was our initial layout that we had our engineer do, which we've hired| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=8640)|
| 2:24:04| Fulger McIndoe. He's working on the concept plan right now, along with a traffic study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=8644)|
| 2:24:11| That was an initial layout that was done internal to the company. So, what we do is we'll rely on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=8651)|
| 2:24:18| the professional engineers to tell us what is the best use of the property. So, with that said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=8658)|
| 2:24:27| that's why we asked for the five, is because, you know, it always gives us, you know, there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=8667)|
| 2:24:33| always room in the concept and even through the design stage that things change and, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=8673)|
| 2:24:38| local requirements, state requirements, maybe, you know, they just change the whole thing. There's a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=8678)|
| 2:24:44| stream on the property, though, that more than likely is a blue line stream. You know, we'll| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=8684)|
| 2:24:48| have to get a stream determination to determine how close you can build, which affects lot count.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=8688)|
| 2:24:53| Okay. Okay. Thank you. Any other discussion? Mr. Snowden?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=8693)|
| 2:24:58| Commissioner Schoonmaker, to your point about the drainage, I did want to mention,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=8698)|
| 2:25:02| I do believe that property is upstream north of there on the other side of West Emory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=8702)|
| 2:25:08| Upon seeing those photos, we looked and the cross drain or the pipe that was under West| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=8708)|
| 2:25:12| Emory was partially collapsed. So, we have since put in a larger, the same size pipe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=8712)|
| 2:25:17| but one that certainly is, you know, going to be conveying the design flow. So,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=8717)|
| 2:25:21| we believe a lot of those issues may be corrected. Okay. Okay. Because you realize that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=8721)|

| 2:28:21| Any other discussion? Seeing none, I'll turn to our commissioner for the 6th District,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=8901)|
| 2:28:27| Commissioner Hill. Mr. Hickey, did I hear you say that the number of homes you're talking about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=8907)|
| 2:28:38| is in fact going to be the 117? So, yeah, the number I gave Mr. Snowden was the preliminary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=8918)|
| 2:28:48| drawing that our internal company engineer drew up. Like, Billy Fulgham's working on a design| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=8928)|
| 2:28:55| right now for the concept plan, so we asked for the five because, you know, everything changes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=8935)|
| 2:29:04| while they design these things, and, you know, the topography out there would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=8944)|
| 2:29:11| certainly allow for more than five in a lot of cases, so that was why we asked for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=8951)|
| 2:29:18| But this 4.2 at the 117 is palatable? Is what, ma'am? Palatable?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=8958)|
| 2:29:25| I mean, when you develop these things, it's hard, you always end up with less.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=8965)|
| 2:29:36| Every time, if it's zoned at four, you end up at 3.4. If it's zoned at five, you always end up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=8976)|
| 2:29:44| at five by the time you subtract out right away and everything at the detention facilities. So,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=8984)|
| 2:29:51| I mean, we would really like to have the five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=8991)|
| 2:29:59| For Mr. Snowden, do you have concerns about additional flooding if this development is built?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=8999)|
| 2:30:12| Not necessarily. I mean, our stormwater ordinance requires the pond to be designed to detain the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=9012)|

| 2:30:23| downstream, you know, neighbors being impacted. There's a very large box culvert under Carnes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=9023)|

| 2:30:51| the impact that it's having. I did talk to Mr. Hickey about this. He tells me, and I believe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=9051)|

| 2:31:18| I believe you until you don't do it. He tells me that this stream is actually state-controlled| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=9078)|
| 2:31:29| and that there will be a lot of, probably, provisions and restrictions as to what you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=9089)|
| 2:31:36| can do around that, which is going to, I think, help to protect this. Do I like the idea of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=9096)|
| 2:31:44| continued development? No, I struggle with it. Do I see that it's going to happen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=9104)|
| 2:31:53| And, in fact, it is going to happen. I do think that this road study is going to generate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=9113)|
| 2:32:01| some improvements that will actually help, given the location of this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=9121)|

| 2:38:51| My property backs up to this property, and we're not opposed to the property being developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=9531)|
| 2:39:02| We're opposed to the medium density rezoning with 12, up to 12 units on 7.9 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=9542)|
| 2:39:10| That seems like a lot of units that, to get that many units, you would have to probably do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=9550)|
| 2:39:18| apartments, which wouldn't be conducive to that area. Also, at the city meeting, it was stated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=9558)|
| 2:39:27| that the property doesn't flood. It has flooded every year that we've lived there, and I have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=9567)|
| 2:39:33| pictures that it could be showing. It only floods during November to February time frame,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=9573)|
| 2:39:42| and Mr. Eddy hasn't lived here during that time frame on the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=9582)|
| 2:39:49| Also, this area is a transit area. We've seen four restaurants go out of business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=9589)|
| 2:39:55| There's currently one, along with a variety of fast food restaurants in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=9595)|
| 2:40:01| So, you know, the population isn't there to support it, and then the two new facilities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=9601)|
| 2:40:07| in that area, yes, they're going to be bringing jobs into the area, but, you know, are all those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=9607)|
| 2:40:14| employees going to be brand new employees who don't already live in the surrounding areas?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=9614)|
| 2:40:18| And then, in his proposal, there's 911 entrances and exits from this development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=9618)|
| 2:40:30| Straw Plains is already a heavily traveled road with a lot of semi trucks with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=9630)|
| 2:40:40| depots that are down off of John Sevier, and there are periods already during the day that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=9640)|
| 2:40:45| it's difficult to get out onto Straw Plains, and with the new truck depot being put in right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=9645)|
| 2:40:53| across from the TBI, we're going to have the additional trucks coming in this way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=9653)|
| 2:40:59| Mayor, if you could wrap up your comments. I think you have some additional people that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=9659)|
| 2:41:02| like to speak, but we... It's just our hope that the commission will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=9662)|
| 2:41:06| reconsider this zoning from medium to possibly low density. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=9666)|
| 2:41:12| Thank you. Sarah, do you want to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=9672)|
| 2:41:15| Please state your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=9675)|
| 2:41:17| I'm Destin LeBlanc. I live at 1609 Wisteria View Way. I'm part of the Wisteria| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=9677)|
| 2:41:24| View Condominium Complex, which is right adjacent, just north of the subject property. I'm, in fact,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=9684)|
| 2:41:30| the president of the HOA. I'll just reiterate the issue about the water, that, yes, there is a small| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=9690)|
| 2:41:38| tributary that goes into Swan Pond Creek that goes in back of their property. It's also in back of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=9698)|
| 2:41:44| our property in the condominium complex. However, we are about six feet higher than theirs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=9704)|
| 2:41:51| and there are regular, every winter, floods where it's portions of that property. And my concern| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=9711)|
| 2:42:00| is that the developer, the applicant, addressed that appropriately because at the MPC meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=9720)|
| 2:42:10| the developer said, I went for the property, and I've never seen flooding there, and he's only| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=9730)|
| 2:42:14| lived there for two or three months. So I would just want to make sure that everybody is aware of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=9734)|
| 2:42:20| that in terms of going forward. I also have a concern about the number of maximum units,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=9740)|
| 2:42:27| 12 per acre. This is for an eight and a half acre site that's sort of a strange shape that already| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=9747)|
| 2:42:34| has significant property on it. I think a reasonable number for that is more like five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=9754)|
| 2:42:41| Our complex, the condominium complex that I live in, has 60 units, and we're about 50% larger in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=9761)|
| 2:42:48| terms of acreage. So that would be the number of five per acre would be a reasonable number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=9768)|
| 2:42:57| The other thing that I would like to see is, and this is more of a recommendation to you guys,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=9777)|
| 2:43:02| not to them, but they said, we don't have any concept plan. We don't have anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=9782)|
| 2:43:07| I mean, they don't have a concept plan, but they don't have a general idea. How many,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=9787)|
| 2:43:10| they want to build apartments, they want to build condos. The people that were here earlier came| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=9790)|
| 2:43:15| and said, hey, we want to build houses. This is what we're going to build. If you take a look at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=9795)|
| 2:43:19| what's going on at Knox Center Mall, they're saying, we're going to build development things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=9799)|
| 2:43:23| before they do the rezoning. And so I think that that should be something that the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=9803)|
| 2:43:28| Knox, that you recommend to the Knox Planning Commission, that there be not extensive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=9808)|
| 2:43:34| development plans, but a general idea of what's going on. Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=9814)|
| 2:43:38| I will. Thank you very much, sir. I will just say, just like we heard before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=9818)|
| 2:43:41| they're applying for planned residential, which if I understand correctly from their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=9821)|
| 2:43:46| planning department, that requires coming back with a concept plan and coming back with more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=9826)|
| 2:43:51| details. Thank you. Ma'am, I'll give you two minutes and then we'll move on. So you'll be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=9831)|
| 2:43:56| the last speaker. If you would please state your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=9836)|
| 2:44:00| My name is Sharon Rush. My husband, Dean Rush, and I live at 1601 Wisteria Viewway adjacent to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=9840)|
| 2:44:08| the property where the builder lives. Again, my concern is very brief. Mine and my husband's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=9848)|
| 2:44:15| interests closely reflect those of Mr. and Mrs. Lacombe, our neighbors in Wisteria. They have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=9855)|
| 2:44:19| presented the facts well. Subsequent research we've done reveals the same concerns as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=9859)|
| 2:44:24| just as general statements and concerns. Numerous factors indicate that low-density housing would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=9864)|
| 2:44:29| be more suitable for this zoning proposal, as they had stated. The traffic flow on Straw Plains| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=9869)|
| 2:44:34| Pike, more importantly, significant elevation concerns. Again, this has already been brought| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=9874)|
| 2:44:38| out regarding flooding in the winter on the acreage. Again, it's already been brought out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=9878)|
| 2:44:42| And regarding environmental impacts and aesthetics, last but not least, property setbacks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=9882)|
| 2:44:48| and green spaces within rural residential housing benefits if it's low-density in its development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=9888)|
| 2:44:54| Low-density would be more in line with current structures in the surrounding area as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=9894)|
| 2:44:58| Thank you. Thank you, ma'am. Would the applicant like to add anything to the conversation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=9898)|
| 2:45:02| I'll give you no more than two minutes, please. Okay, I'll be brief. I guess first off,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=9902)|
| 2:45:08| the only opposition that we've received is from zoning that is the same zoning that we are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=9908)|
| 2:45:12| requesting. When we went in and met with the county initially, they told us that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=9912)|
| 2:45:19| if you look at the area plan, and I wish I would have brought a copy of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=9919)|
| 2:45:22| it actually, there's very limited amounts of property that are set for medium-density| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=9922)|
| 2:45:26| residential in that area. There could not be a better piece of property to be zoned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=9926)|
| 2:45:30| for this. Straw Plains is a busier road, which is ideal. It's wide. It has capacity. There's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=9930)|
| 2:45:37| view. You can see hundreds of feet both directions, which tends to be pretty rare here in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=9937)|
| 2:45:42| Also, if you look at the KGIS map, it does not show any flooding plain on our property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=9942)|
| 2:45:48| Obviously, we've already hired, we're hiring an engineer to look at that, and we would obviously| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=9948)|
| 2:45:53| make sure that the property drains properly and would comply with all current engineer requirements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=9953)|
| 2:46:01| but currently, KGIS shows no flood zone there. There is a small spot that does get wet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=9961)|
| 2:46:07| and we've let our engineer know about that, and he would certainly work that into our plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=9967)|
| 2:46:12| Do you have anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=9972)|
| 2:46:15| Just to address some of the concerns, we typically are building for first-time home builders,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=9975)|
| 2:46:24| home buyers rather, small starter homes. I don't know if that alleviates any concerns or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=9984)|
| 2:46:32| but just to reiterate, the opposition, interestingly, is coming from residents who| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=9992)|
| 2:46:38| enjoy the same zoning that we're requesting at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=9998)|
| 2:46:45| We feel like whatever we do will be a good project, and we'll add to the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=10005)|
| 2:46:51| Thank you, sir. Based upon what I'm hearing, you might want to go see what the flooding looks like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=10011)|
| 2:46:55| tonight. I will turn to the Commissioner of the 8th District for a motion or any further discussion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=10015)|
| 2:47:01| but I am seeing Commissioner Daly's light, so if you guys work it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=10021)|
| 2:47:06| I would prefer to defer to my fellow commissioners for questions first,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=10026)|
| 2:47:09| and I do have a question for Mr. Snowden before I make any kind of a motion, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=10029)|
| 2:47:15| Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Eddie, how long have you all been in business?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=10035)|
| 2:47:21| Please speak into the microphone, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=10041)|
| 2:47:25| I've been a licensed contractor for about 25 years in three separate states,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=10045)|
| 2:47:33| including currently here in Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=10053)|
| 2:47:36| So your investments, you're not buying this land to turn around and flip it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=10056)|
| 2:47:41| Oh, no, no, not at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=10061)|
| 2:47:42| So it sounds like you're going to build condominiums and not apartments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=10062)|
| 2:47:47| It's more like condominiums.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=10067)|
| 2:47:50| Yeah, we're leaning more towards townhouses right now is kind of the design we're working with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=10070)|
| 2:47:54| We were leaning more towards probably entry-level first-time home buyers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=10074)|
| 2:47:59| There's not a lot of stuff being added in that area, and we've got a tremendous| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=10079)|
| 2:48:02| amount of jobs, fortunately, coming into that area with the new plants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=10082)|
| 2:48:05| So that was kind of the market we wanted to hit, looking at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=10085)|
| 2:48:09| Even if you look at that area, too, there's not hardly any property with the zoning of medium| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=10089)|
| 2:48:13| residential density, and that's why we were so excited when we saw that it was on the future| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=10093)|
| 2:48:18| growth plan to have this property be that zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=10098)|
| 2:48:23| Thank you. I just wanted to get a little bit of history about your company and what you did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=10103)|
| 2:48:27| Yeah, my father has been building for years, and I've also been in real estate the last| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=10107)|
| 2:48:30| 18 years doing sales and assisting with development and construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=10110)|
| 2:48:36| Commissioner Beeler, if you'll entertain another comment, Mr. Schoonmaker has a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=10116)|
| 2:48:41| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=10121)|
| 2:48:42| Commissioner Beeler, if I'm standing on Straw Plains Pike looking at their property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=10122)|
| 2:48:47| is the new Fresenius Warehouse, is that going to be like this way or this way?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=10127)|
| 2:48:53| It's going to be to your left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=10133)|
| 2:48:55| Microphone, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=10135)|
| 2:48:56| It would be to your left and then to the right on John Sevier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=10136)|
| 2:49:00| So a little bit away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200928-combined?start=10140)|
