| 0:12:26| We had gotten a written request for the deferral, so that's what I put up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160315?start=746)|
| 0:12:30| We don't know exactly what's missing right now, but a lot of items are missing from the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160315?start=750)|
| 0:12:34| file.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160315?start=754)|
| 0:12:35| I think he's had some construction delays.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160315?start=755)|
| 0:12:36| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160315?start=756)|
| 0:12:37| Now, one of the issues that has come up is your LLC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160315?start=757)|
| 0:12:41| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160315?start=761)|
| 0:12:42| You need to get that taken care of before you come back to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160315?start=762)|
| 0:12:45| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160315?start=765)|

| 0:12:49| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160315?start=769)|
| 0:12:50| You want to straighten that out and be back in business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160315?start=770)|
| 0:12:51| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160315?start=771)|
| 0:12:52| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160315?start=772)|
| 0:12:53| I know you've had more construction issues than anyone could have anticipated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160315?start=773)|
| 0:12:59| So, assuming that they're moving forward, when do you really think you're going to open?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160315?start=779)|
| 0:13:04| We feel like one month, at the very most, two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160315?start=784)|
| 0:13:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160315?start=788)|
| 0:13:09| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160315?start=789)|
| 0:13:10| So, do you want us to defer this for one month or two months?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160315?start=790)|
| 0:13:13| At this time, one month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160315?start=793)|
| 0:13:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160315?start=796)|
| 0:13:17| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160315?start=797)|
| 0:13:18| Move to defer for one month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160315?start=798)|
| 0:13:19| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160315?start=799)|
| 0:13:20| To April 26th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160315?start=800)|

| 0:13:28| Get your LLC straightened out and your construction done, and we'll all look forward to coming| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160315?start=808)|
| 0:13:31| to Mulligan's to have food and beverage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160315?start=811)|

| 0:14:42| That's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160315?start=882)|
| 0:14:43| But she's very important, too, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160315?start=883)|
| 0:14:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160315?start=884)|
| 0:14:45| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160315?start=885)|
| 0:14:46| Well, we would still not hold that against you at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160315?start=886)|
| 0:14:47| You can read and drink at the same time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160315?start=887)|
| 0:14:48| I know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160315?start=888)|

| 0:14:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160315?start=891)|
| 0:14:52| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160315?start=892)|
| 0:14:53| And when do you think you'll have all this done and be open?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160315?start=893)|
| 0:14:55| We hope in the next three or four weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160315?start=895)|

| 0:15:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160315?start=916)|
| 0:15:17| Ms. Dyer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160315?start=917)|
| 0:15:20| We need the fire prevention approval and the permit from the former owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160315?start=920)|
| 0:15:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160315?start=923)|
| 0:15:24| When do you think you're going to go to take the task class| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160315?start=924)|
| 0:15:28| but very specifically get your fingerprints and the background check?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160315?start=928)|

| 0:15:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160315?start=934)|
| 0:15:35| Well, we have a policy here that if you haven't completed your fingerprints,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160315?start=935)|
| 0:15:38| that we defer you to the next meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160315?start=938)|
| 0:15:41| So that would be April 26th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160315?start=941)|
| 0:15:43| I was there last Thursday, but the class was full, so I couldn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160315?start=943)|
| 0:15:47| Well, did you call ahead to get a spot?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160315?start=947)|
| 0:15:50| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160315?start=950)|

| 0:15:52| No, I'll go there at 8 and get a spot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160315?start=952)|
| 0:15:54| Well, you can call ahead and reserve a spot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160315?start=954)|
| 0:15:57| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160315?start=957)|
| 0:15:58| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160315?start=958)|
| 0:15:59| Actually, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160315?start=959)|
| 0:16:00| It's first come, first serve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160315?start=960)|
| 0:16:01| If people call for information, we tell them to get there as early as possible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160315?start=961)|
| 0:16:04| because only the first 25 can be seated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160315?start=964)|
| 0:16:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160315?start=967)|
| 0:16:08| Well, then get there at 745, I guess, would be the best thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160315?start=968)|
| 0:16:10| Bring pepper spray.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160315?start=970)|

| 0:16:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160315?start=974)|
| 0:16:15| Do I have a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160315?start=975)|
| 0:16:17| Can we do that without the background check?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160315?start=977)|
| 0:16:19| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160315?start=979)|
| 0:16:20| Oh, it's to defer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160315?start=980)|
| 0:16:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160315?start=981)|

| 0:16:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160315?start=986)|
| 0:16:27| So get your task class done, get your backgrounds checked,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160315?start=987)|
| 0:16:29| and then we'll see you on April 26th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160315?start=989)|
| 0:16:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160315?start=991)|
| 0:16:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160315?start=992)|
| 0:16:36| All right, next is the remote area medical event,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160315?start=996)|
| 0:16:41| and they moved that to Farragut, and they have their permit from Farragut,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160315?start=1001)|
| 0:16:45| so they are not going to be before us tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160315?start=1005)|
| 0:16:50| But they're still going to have their event on April the 29th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160315?start=1010)|
| 0:16:54| And if I remember, it's tacos and tequila.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160315?start=1014)|
| 0:16:57| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160315?start=1017)|
| 0:16:59| And so we need to withdraw this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160315?start=1019)|
| 0:17:01| Do I have a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160315?start=1021)|

| 0:23:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160315?start=1399)|
| 0:23:22| This particular location also has had a TABC hearing with a suspension and a fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160315?start=1402)|
| 0:23:30| Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160315?start=1410)|
| 0:23:31| Yes, that is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160315?start=1411)|
| 0:23:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160315?start=1412)|
| 0:23:33| And you had two sales within a three-year period, which is why the TABC got involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160315?start=1413)|
| 0:23:39| But we're required to have you here because when you go before TABC, we see you also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160315?start=1419)|
| 0:23:45| So you submitted a very comprehensive plan, more so than some we've seen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160315?start=1425)|
| 0:23:53| And that's a real positive on your part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160315?start=1433)|
| 0:23:56| Would this board like to discuss, do we need to send them further, or are we satisfied with where they are?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160315?start=1436)|
| 0:24:08| Councilman Starr, I know you're ready to say something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160315?start=1448)|
| 0:24:11| I'm satisfied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160315?start=1451)|
| 0:24:12| I guess I just had a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160315?start=1452)|
| 0:24:13| So is this before us because it went to TABC?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160315?start=1453)|
| 0:24:16| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160315?start=1456)|
| 0:24:17| Because our rule is two citations within two years, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160315?start=1457)|
| 0:24:20| Right, right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160315?start=1460)|
| 0:24:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160315?start=1461)|
| 0:24:22| We have another one that will be here next month that's a three-year thing from TABC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160315?start=1462)|
| 0:24:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160315?start=1468)|
| 0:24:29| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160315?start=1469)|
| 0:24:30| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160315?start=1470)|
| 0:24:31| Councilman Della Vofe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160315?start=1471)|
| 0:24:32| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160315?start=1472)|
| 0:24:33| It looked to me, at least on paper, as a pretty comprehensive plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160315?start=1473)|
| 0:24:36| Will you have in-house training to make sure it gets carried out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160315?start=1476)|
| 0:24:40| Yes, we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160315?start=1480)|
| 0:24:41| We actually already had an all-store meeting back on February 21st, Sunday, February 21st,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160315?start=1481)|
| 0:24:48| where we went over all of the policies and had a refresher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160315?start=1488)|
| 0:24:53| All of these things we already have in place within Applebee's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160315?start=1493)|
| 0:24:58| This particular situation just came down to one employee that failed to follow policy, and that was the outcome of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160315?start=1498)|
| 0:25:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160315?start=1507)|
| 0:25:08| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160315?start=1508)|
| 0:25:09| Well, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160315?start=1509)|
| 0:25:10| I accept.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160315?start=1510)|
| 0:25:11| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160315?start=1511)|
| 0:25:12| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160315?start=1512)|
| 0:25:13| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160315?start=1513)|
| 0:25:14| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160315?start=1514)|
| 0:25:15| Well, we would like to not ever see you again for sale to a minor, and you don't want to see us again for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160315?start=1515)|
| 0:25:19| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160315?start=1519)|
| 0:25:20| So good luck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160315?start=1520)|
| 0:25:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160315?start=1521)|
| 0:25:22| Thank you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160315?start=1522)|
| 0:25:23| Next is Surinam of Thailand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160315?start=1523)|
| 0:25:29| Greg Harrison here on behalf of the establishment, 800 South Gay Street, suite 1650.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160315?start=1529)|
| 0:25:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160315?start=1534)|
| 0:25:35| This was a situation where there were two violations within a year, and it was the same person who was involved with the sale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160315?start=1535)|
| 0:25:44| That person is no longer employed by Surinam, and we don't have the paperwork on it yet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160315?start=1544)|
| 0:25:50| but I understand that they have a 10-day suspension and a $1,500 fine from TABC that is either in effect as we speak or about to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160315?start=1550)|
| 0:26:01| The fine has been paid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160315?start=1561)|
| 0:26:03| The suspension began yesterday, 14th through the 23rd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160315?start=1563)|
| 0:26:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160315?start=1567)|
| 0:26:08| Now, this is not uncommon for us to get the paperwork after this action has occurred,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160315?start=1568)|
| 0:26:14| and you're going to probably have to come back before us again when we get the paperwork because the state requires that to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160315?start=1574)|
| 0:26:22| I've actually got the order with the ABC if you want me to give it to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160315?start=1582)|
| 0:26:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160315?start=1587)|
| 0:26:28| Just a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160315?start=1588)|
| 0:26:31| We still have to have the notice from TABC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160315?start=1591)|
| 0:26:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160315?start=1593)|
| 0:26:34| We appreciate your offer to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160315?start=1594)|
| 0:26:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160315?start=1596)|
| 0:26:37| So we will see you again when we get that order, and it probably will be next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160315?start=1597)|
| 0:26:43| Do you want us to be here on the 26th?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160315?start=1603)|
| 0:26:46| Are you going to let us know?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160315?start=1606)|
| 0:26:47| You'll get a notice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160315?start=1607)|
| 0:26:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160315?start=1608)|
| 0:26:49| All right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160315?start=1609)|
| 0:26:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160315?start=1610)|
| 0:26:51| And thank you for coming tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160315?start=1611)|
| 0:26:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160315?start=1612)|
| 0:26:53| And good luck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160315?start=1613)|
| 0:26:54| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160315?start=1614)|
| 0:26:55| Let's go back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160315?start=1615)|
| 0:26:56| Is the laundry here yet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160315?start=1616)|
| 0:26:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160315?start=1617)|
| 0:27:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160315?start=1622)|
| 0:27:03| We don't have anything, anyone from the laundry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160315?start=1623)|
| 0:27:07| Are we postponing the laundry?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160315?start=1627)|
| 0:27:08| I move that we defer it to the next meeting, the 26th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160315?start=1628)|
| 0:27:11| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160315?start=1631)|
| 0:27:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160315?start=1632)|
| 0:27:13| We have a motion and a second to defer it to the 26th of April.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160315?start=1633)|
| 0:27:17| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160315?start=1637)|
| 0:27:18| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160315?start=1638)|
| 0:27:19| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160315?start=1639)|
| 0:27:20| Now, before you jump up and run out, we have one more item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160315?start=1640)|
| 0:27:23| Because the meeting in April is so late in the month, because we have three meetings in February,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160315?start=1643)|
| 0:27:29| we have a new business opening at 16 Market Square, Amelia, and it is an Italian restaurant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160315?start=1649)|
| 0:27:36| and it's located at the site of the old Latitude 35, with which we are all very familiar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160315?start=1656)|
| 0:27:43| And the owner is Matt Gallaher of Knox Mason fame, and the property is owned by Randy Burleson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160315?start=1663)|
| 0:27:50| Mr. Gallaher contacted Councilman Stair, and then Mr. Gallaher contacted me yesterday to see if we could have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160315?start=1670)|
| 0:27:59| if there was any way that they could meet sooner than April 26th, because they want to be serving food before then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160315?start=1679)|
| 0:28:06| So, Councilman Stair, would you like to say anything?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160315?start=1686)|
| 0:28:10| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160315?start=1690)|
| 0:28:12| I'm just generally supportive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160315?start=1692)|
| 0:28:13| It's like you explained, because we have three meetings in March.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160315?start=1693)|
| 0:28:17| The next beer board meeting is not until six weeks from tonight, and they were looking to be open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160315?start=1697)|
| 0:28:25| They're shooting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160315?start=1705)|
| 0:28:26| Of course, you never know what's going to happen with construction, but they're shooting to be open in April.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160315?start=1706)|
| 0:28:29| They're on Market Square with the Dogwood Arts Festival and Rossini.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160315?start=1709)|
| 0:28:34| Obviously, that's an important time to be open if you lease space on Market Square.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160315?start=1714)|
| 0:28:40| So, I would certainly be in favor of it, and I would make the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160315?start=1720)|
| 0:28:44| The other thing I might add on to it, I felt a little bad for the gentleman from Raceway who went to get the background check| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160315?start=1724)|
| 0:28:52| and wasn't able to, and potentially we could also hear his at the same time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160315?start=1732)|
| 0:29:01| So, I guess the motion would be to have a special meeting on, was it March 29th, at 6.50, which would be before Council in two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160315?start=1741)|
| 0:29:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160315?start=1750)|
| 0:29:11| So, you'd like to hear Raceway assuming that he gets there to get his stuff done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160315?start=1751)|
| 0:29:15| I think we could, is it possible to give him the option if he's able to do the background check before then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160315?start=1755)|
| 0:29:24| Is that a proper motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160315?start=1764)|
| 0:29:26| Well, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160315?start=1766)|
| 0:29:27| They'd have to have time to advertise it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160315?start=1767)|
| 0:29:30| They have time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160315?start=1770)|
| 0:29:31| They have time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160315?start=1771)|
| 0:29:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160315?start=1772)|
| 0:29:33| So, you want to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160315?start=1773)|
| 0:29:34| Unfortunately, I guess the gentleman left, but.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160315?start=1774)|
| 0:29:36| We've got ways to contact him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160315?start=1776)|
| 0:29:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160315?start=1778)|
| 0:29:39| He's in my district, so I know where he is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160315?start=1779)|
| 0:29:40| That's the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160315?start=1780)|
| 0:29:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160315?start=1783)|
| 0:29:44| Councilman DellaVolpe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160315?start=1784)|
| 0:29:45| I'm just curious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160315?start=1785)|
| 0:29:47| This situation raised a question in my mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160315?start=1787)|
| 0:29:49| Maybe Sergeant Hunter can help us, but I can understand you show up and the 25 seats are filled up so you don't take the task class.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160315?start=1789)|
| 0:29:58| Why can't they fingerprint you at the front desk when you come in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160315?start=1798)|
| 0:30:01| Well, we don't do the fingerprinting in-house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160315?start=1801)|
| 0:30:04| We actually make the appointment and send them on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160315?start=1804)|
| 0:30:07| But, you know, if he was turned away and he never contacted us, you know, last Thursday wasn't the only day available for that to occur.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160315?start=1807)|
| 0:30:16| I'm sure there were.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160315?start=1816)|
| 0:30:17| He could have come during the week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160315?start=1817)|
| 0:30:19| We do appointments on Tuesdays and Thursdays, so I'm sure there was plenty of opportunity for him to have scheduled an appointment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160315?start=1819)|
| 0:30:26| or try to make one of the other Thursdays.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160315?start=1826)|
| 0:30:28| Do we post that or something in the office that he went to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160315?start=1828)|
| 0:30:31| It's actually handed out to him when they get their application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160315?start=1831)|
| 0:30:35| So if he had read it carefully, he would have realized he could have gotten the background check.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160315?start=1835)|
| 0:30:38| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160315?start=1838)|
| 0:30:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160315?start=1839)|
| 0:30:40| And that was in that package with the application that we got Thursday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160315?start=1840)|
| 0:30:43| All right, so we have a motion and a second for a special meeting on March 29th to hear Amelia and Ray Sway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160315?start=1843)|
| 0:30:52| And we voted to approve that, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160315?start=1852)|
| 0:30:54| We haven't voted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160315?start=1854)|
| 0:30:56| They haven't voted yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160315?start=1856)|
| 0:30:57| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160315?start=1857)|
| 0:30:58| Everyone in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160315?start=1858)|
| 0:30:59| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160315?start=1859)|
| 0:31:00| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160315?start=1860)|
| 0:31:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160315?start=1861)|
| 0:31:02| That's good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160315?start=1862)|
| 0:31:03| Any other business?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160315?start=1863)|
| 0:31:04| We're adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160315?start=1864)|
