| 2:56:22| is 8 Pilser Street, Asheville, North Carolina 28804. I did say that, and it is a challenging| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=10582)|
| 2:56:30| piece of property. When this first came before the Planning Commission and planning staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=10590)|
| 2:56:34| there was no proposal for a plan, a preliminary plan. There was no thought given to how to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=10594)|
| 2:56:41| appropriately develop this property. Staff imagined that the full one lot, single family lot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=10601)|
| 2:56:50| uniform lot sizes, three to four units per acre that we see throughout Knox County, which would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=10610)|
| 2:56:56| not be appropriate for this property. We, as staff, recommended denial. The Planning Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=10616)|
| 2:57:02| I believe, also recommended denial. And the County Commission ultimately on track to deny the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=10622)|
| 2:57:10| rezoning when it was withdrawn. We then met with Mr. Kennard, his staff, and proposed a more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=10630)|
| 2:57:17| feasible development approach to this. And he listened, which was unusual for a developer to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=10637)|
| 2:57:23| listen to the planning staff, but he's preserving, as he stated, 16 acres, not just the floodway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=10643)|
| 2:57:29| which cannot be built in, but also the floodplain, which can be developed. So there will be more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=10649)|
| 2:57:36| area to protect and absorb floodwaters than under a typical development proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=10656)|
| 2:57:43| He also proposed preserving the steeper slopes and clustering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=10663)|
| 2:57:47| the development with attached units on those slopes of 15% or less. And we had not seen that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=10667)|
| 2:57:54| we had not walked the property at that first time. So staff walked the property and saw that it could| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=10674)|
| 2:58:00| be developed if appropriate measures were taken. And I do believe, as Mr. Grandieu said, that this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=10680)|
| 2:58:05| is a model for future development in Knox County, rather than the cookie cutter approach of three,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=10685)|
| 2:58:11| four, five units per acre, all single family homes, the standard lot, scrape and level the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=10691)|
| 2:58:18| area. I believe this is an appropriate approach for those challenging sites and the sites that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=10698)|
| 2:58:25| are even worse than this. I'm reminded of the properties and properties in Hardin Valley that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=10705)|
| 2:58:30| have the same type of constraints that this property has, that this development proposal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=10710)|
| 2:58:35| could be a model for. So, yes, I did say that, but that with more information will change our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=10715)|
| 2:58:41| mind. And if we don't accept challenges, then we don't go anywhere. And this is a challenging site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=10721)|
| 2:58:46| but I believe by accepting the challenges that this site proposes or presents, Mr. Pinard has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=10726)|
| 2:58:53| developed a very feasible development plan and it's deserving of support as recommended by the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=10733)|
| 2:58:59| planning staff and by the Planning Commission. Thank you, Mr. Green. So it sounds like there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=10739)|
| 2:59:07| been a lot of communication between Mr. Randy and the Planning Commission. So I have a question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=10747)|
| 2:59:13| for Mr. Randy Pinard. Have you reached out to the community at all to kind of do some updates?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=10753)|
| 2:59:20| Have they been able to look at the land? Did you offer that to the community?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=10760)|
| 2:59:27| I think Commissioner Courtney Durrett could answer that, but we did try to reach out and I don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=10767)|
| 2:59:35| think that she got any response. We were going to have a Zoom meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=10775)|
| 2:59:42| All right. Thank you. Thank you, Ms. Lundy. Courtney, Commissioner Durrett, you're up next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=10782)|
| 2:59:53| Okay. I did have a question for Mr. Pinard specifically. Do you know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=10793)|
| 3:00:00| what Legacy Parks is planning to do with the donated floodway if we were to go that route?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=10800)|
| 3:00:10| I think it would be a similar project. I'm sorry that Carol Evans is not available. I didn't invite| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=10810)|
| 3:00:17| her, but as I understand it, it was going to be a similar project as the Harold Road Park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=10817)|
| 3:00:23| which has, I think, been renamed the Roy Arthur Park. Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=10823)|
| 3:00:33| There is a letter in the document from Legacy Parks, but I don't know if it spells it out very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=10833)|
| 3:00:37| specific. It doesn't. It just says that there's been communication and that that land would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=10837)|
| 3:00:46| donated to Legacy Parks if this were to move forward. As far as the flooding, I know you are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=10846)|
| 3:00:57| doing things or will do things in your plan to address floodings that would come from construction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=10857)|
| 3:01:03| and the building of houses on this property, but is there anything in your plan to address the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=10863)|
| 3:01:09| current flooding or to at least attempt to mitigate it? Because, of course, adding the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=10869)|
| 3:01:15| potential for more flooding would exacerbate the problem tremendously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=10875)|
| 3:01:23| We are required by law to that the peak flow off of our property would be less| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=10883)|
| 3:01:29| after the development than before it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=10889)|
| 3:01:35| Okay. I guess my question is, are you, aside from addressing what your property would be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=10895)|
| 3:01:46| the potential flooding your property would be creating by developing it, are you kind of going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=10906)|
| 3:01:52| above and beyond or anything like that to attempt to address the current flooding that there is on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=10912)|
| 3:01:57| this property right now or at the base of this property right now or in the floodway?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=10917)|
| 3:02:04| Yes, I'd like to defer to Chris on that. I think he could answer. Our plan was to go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=10924)|
| 3:02:10| beyond what was required, but Chris, could you say something on that, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=10930)|
| 3:02:16| Yes, and I want to make it clear, I'm not the design engineer for this project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=10936)|
| 3:02:22| but I have discussed extensively the nature of the design. So,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=10942)|
| 3:02:30| the goal, what the team is trying to do is, in fact, add, increase infiltration. I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=10950)|
| 3:02:40| sort of a net negative impact, which would be a positive impact, of course,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=10960)|
| 3:02:49| with the development and the discussion, and this is basically a lot of engineering gobbledygook,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=10969)|
| 3:02:55| but the discussion about it sounded very hopeful and that there are options that could be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=10975)|
| 3:03:01| If the use of the floodplain area were similar to what is done in Herald Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=10981)|
| 3:03:10| I assume most people at the meeting here are familiar with the Herald Road Stormwater Park or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=10990)|
| 3:03:16| Roy Arthur, more aptly named Stormwater Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=10996)|
| 3:03:23| There are opportunities to add additional floodplain storage in this area, but, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=11003)|
| 3:03:31| expectations have to be realistic. The system flooding that we all know of dumpsters floating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=11011)|
| 3:03:39| down Broadway and trucks overturned and all of the destruction in the lower reaches of First Creek,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=11019)|
| 3:03:48| that's major system flooding, and it takes, there's no 80-acre site that's going to make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=11028)|
| 3:03:56| that, that's going to solve that, but this is a step. This is helpful, and I think it will be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=11036)|
| 3:04:05| so in a quantifiable manner as well. So, hopefully that answers your question without too much| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=11045)|
| 3:04:12| engineering speak. Okay. Thank you, and Director Snowden, are you still here with us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=11052)|
| 3:04:21| Yes, Commissioner Durd, I'm here. Some of the concerns that have been brought to my attention| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=11061)|
| 3:04:26| from the community are the curve that's right there. I travel this road frequently, and I know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=11066)|
| 3:04:33| exactly what they're talking about. Is there site distance on this? And so, two things, the site| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=11073)|
| 3:04:41| distance and another one, as was brought up by Mr. Taylor, the lawyer for the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=11081)|
| 3:04:49| the lawyer for the community, speaking in opposition, is the, if this were to flood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=11089)|
| 3:04:58| would he be able to put an entrance where there is flooding currently? Like they said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=11098)|
| 3:05:05| they could potentially get trapped in this development. Yes, Commissioner, we looked at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=11105)|
| 3:05:12| that. That was one of our, well, two of our concerns, obviously, was access. Should the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=11112)|
| 3:05:17| road flood? And we feel like, based on the frontage that Mr. Garrard has, that he can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=11117)|
| 3:05:23| establish an entryway that does allow safe ingress with a flood event, like what the pictures indicate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=11123)|
| 3:05:31| as well as we feel like there's a cut bank there, cut slope that would need to be modified,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=11131)|
| 3:05:37| but it looks like it's within his frontage, and he can confirm some of these, but it looks like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=11137)|
| 3:05:41| he could shave that bank back and achieve site distance. So, those two concerns for us appears| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=11141)|
| 3:05:47| preliminarily like they could be resolved with his engineering team. Okay. Those are all the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=11147)|
| 3:05:57| questions I have for right now. I will defer to other commissioners with questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=11157)|
| 3:06:07| I need to unmute. Sorry about that. Thank you very much, Commissioner Hill. You're up next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=11167)|
| 3:06:12| Yes, thank you, Commissioner Jay. As the applicant indicated, several| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=11172)|
| 3:06:22| commissioners did go out and tour the property, and I was one of them that did take him up on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=11182)|
| 3:06:28| his offer. And all I can say is I'm extremely grateful that I did. I, too, had driven that road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=11188)|
| 3:06:37| many times, and when you glance over to the right where that property is, it appears it would be an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=11197)|
| 3:06:46| impossible build. This is just a layperson talking, but it did not take five minutes once| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=11206)|
| 3:06:54| I was back on the property to recognize, number one, what a beautiful piece of property it is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=11214)|
| 3:07:02| but also how much it truly does level and flatten once you kind of get over the initial hillside| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=11222)|
| 3:07:12| area. I do hear what the applicant has done in efforts to truly make this project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=11232)|
| 3:07:28| fit the land, so to speak. I was knocked off for a few minutes, so it may have already been brought| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=11248)|
| 3:07:36| up as far as the type of homes that he is looking to build, the garage up, garage down type of homes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=11256)|
| 3:07:43| that build directly into slopes, whether the slope is up or down, this type of thing that really we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=11263)|
| 3:07:51| just don't see hardly at all in Knox County, and I was very, very impressed by that. I also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=11271)|
| 3:08:00| really liked the look of the floodplain area back there by the creek and the fact that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=11280)|
| 3:08:11| it will be donated and it will be turned into a stormwater park. Several of you have mentioned the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=11291)|
| 3:08:19| Herald Stormwater, Roy Arthur Park, and it's in my district, and I just attended the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=11299)|
| 3:08:29| renaming of it a few months ago, and I will tell you, if you would have seen that property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=11309)|
| 3:08:35| before they turned it into a stormwater park, you would have never dreamed that this really very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=11315)|
| 3:08:42| ugly piece of property could amount to anything that would be passing for something that the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=11322)|
| 3:08:49| community would be proud of, and I felt that very same feeling when I went back to the property that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=11329)|
| 3:08:57| would be, in fact, become part of a stormwater park, which not to mention can't even be accessed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=11337)|
| 3:09:04| right now because there is no development on the land. That's a beautiful piece of property that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=11344)|
| 3:09:10| I think would be very beneficial to the community in general to be able to access that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=11350)|
| 3:09:19| I would not have thought I would start out supporting this project, but actually I do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=11359)|
| 3:09:25| support it. I do think that the 2.51 is a reasonable ask, and I will be supporting this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=11365)|
| 3:09:34| Thank you, Commissioner Hill. Commissioner Smith, you're up next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=11374)|
| 3:09:42| Thank you, Mr. Chair. In reviewing the MPC file, I noticed that these pictures are from February| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=11382)|
| 3:09:53| 23rd of 2019. I think it's pretty safe to say whether you were on North Shore or Cedar Bluff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=11393)|
| 3:10:05| in 2019 and 2020, you had flooding issues. Reading through it, I see the neighbors complaining of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=11405)|
| 3:10:16| flooding. One person says two times in four years. Well, I would assume those are probably the two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=11416)|
| 3:10:23| Februarys of 19 and 20, where our whole county was facing unprecedented flooding issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=11423)|
| 3:10:30| I guess my first question is for Mr. Taylor. You had said it floods three or four times a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=11430)|
| 3:10:40| Are there any more pictures to document that? Not with me. On our website, if you look,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=11440)|
| 3:10:47| there's pictures from a number of different floods. Yes, it does flood two, three times a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=11447)|
| 3:10:53| Some are worse than others, but yes, that is correct. What is your flood site address?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=11453)|
| 3:11:00| I'm looking for it. I apologize. Okay, let me go ahead and ask Mr. Ganju a question. Sir,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=11460)|
| 3:11:19| it is conceivable with the right type of engineering and the right type of development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=11479)|
| 3:11:25| that a property can actually yield less water into the water system than it currently has.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=11485)|
| 3:11:32| Is that correct? Yeah, that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=11492)|
| 3:11:41| I think, yeah, that's correct, that it's conceivable. Okay, and have you seen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=11501)|
| 3:11:50| you said you were not the engineering designer on this project, but have you seen the plans and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=11510)|
| 3:11:59| are there anything in it that you could explain to us that will help to achieve a yield that is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=11519)|
| 3:12:06| less than what's there right now? And the reason why I think that's important for that to be able| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=11526)|
| 3:12:12| to be achieved is people are concerned about the flooding, but if this person can demonstrate and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=11532)|
| 3:12:21| show that they won't be adding to the flooding, you can't hold somebody else responsible for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=11541)|
| 3:12:27| existing problems. Yes, absolutely. So to explain that, and I hope you'll understand, I don't want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=11547)|
| 3:12:40| to put a friend and colleague in a tough position of promising something in his design that I don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=11560)|
| 3:12:48| have to do, but the engineer's approach is to provide infiltration areas specifically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=11568)|
| 3:13:00| and as water runs off from the slope towards the development and then also for the development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=11580)|
| 3:13:07| for the runoff generated by the development itself, to use permeable paver systems, which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=11587)|
| 3:13:14| I think actually people are familiar with in the Knox County area, for infiltration and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=11594)|
| 3:13:23| really have a goal to completely absorb on site any runoff generated by the change in land,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=11603)|
| 3:13:32| by the change in land use of the development. I'd be careful that I wouldn't say that expecting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=11612)|
| 3:13:42| that it would reduce the runoff from, you know, how it is today. There's a lot of factors that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=11622)|
| 3:13:50| can come into play, and I've seen the design process of plans review firsthand for a long time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=11630)|
| 3:13:56| so a lot of stuff happens, but I think the goal of infiltrating the runoff that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=11636)|
| 3:14:06| generated by the change in land use is a reasonable goal. It's a challenge, like everybody said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=11646)|
| 3:14:15| but if you look around at what's being proposed for development in Knox County, it's all a challenge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=11655)|

| 3:14:35| Commissioner Smith, you still have the floor. Do you have additional questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=11675)|
| 3:14:42| You're muted. You're still muted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=11682)|
| 3:14:46| Just, yes, you have questions, or no, you do not have questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=11686)|
| 3:15:00| You're still muted. I can't, we can't hear you. So, I'm going to, I may come back to you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=11700)|
| 3:15:05| if you can jump back in, Commissioner Daley. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Director Snowden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=11705)|
| 3:15:09| Hello, Director Snowden. I go. Sorry, Commissioner Daley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=11709)|
| 3:15:19| That's all right. It's Zoom. We're used to it. Is it not the case that a property owner has to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=11719)|
| 3:15:27| retain equal to or less than the runoff that is currently flowing? That is correct, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=11727)|
| 3:15:35| Mr. Grangew is exactly right. It's my department's job to make sure that those downstream owners see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=11735)|
| 3:15:41| no harm, and my staff would be diligent in that effect. So, in other words, there's going to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=11741)|
| 3:15:47| no more water coming off that property now, and then it will be in a year from now or two years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=11747)|
| 3:15:53| from now. Give us the explanation. Can we use both, or which would we use here, a retention| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=11753)|
| 3:16:01| or a detention bond? And I haven't seen design drawings, but from what Mr. Grangew is saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=11761)|
| 3:16:09| they're doing infiltration, which means the water doesn't leave the side. It actually goes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=11769)|
| 3:16:14| into the ground, which is retention and not detention. Okay. On this retention,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=11774)|
| 3:16:24| Jim, will it be a 100-year flood or the 500-year flood that's determined? How do y'all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=11784)|
| 3:16:30| determine which one we look at? We had the 500-year flood back in February, was it, or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=11790)|
| 3:16:38| last year? It depends on how you look at it. As far as there was that preceding rain event,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=11798)|
| 3:16:47| the storm itself was not that big, but time you added in the moisture content of the soil| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=11807)|
| 3:16:53| prior to it probably did correlate about that. Yes, we would ensure that that flow was no greater| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=11813)|
| 3:17:00| at the 100-year mark. So, that's our threshold there. That's what I want to make sure of and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=11820)|
| 3:17:06| let everyone know that the amount of water that's coming off there now will not be any greater,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=11826)|
| 3:17:12| and there's a possibility that it could be less. But rest assured, it will not be greater than| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=11832)|
| 3:17:19| what it is now. Thank you, Jim. Thank you, Mr. Chair. Thank you, Commissioner Daly. Commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=11839)|
| 3:17:27| Smith, are you able to unmute and jump back in? Yes, sir. I'm sorry I didn't lower my hand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=11847)|
| 3:17:37| No problem. The floor is yours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=11857)|
| 3:17:42| Mr. Snowden, a permeable site with retention, I think is the word you used,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=11862)|
| 3:17:55| it uses a combination of spaces, pavers, and it does have a pond also, doesn't it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=11875)|
| 3:18:05| It can. Like I said, I haven't seen any specific plans for this site, but I think the engineer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=11885)|
| 3:18:14| that is doing the work had another location in Hardin Valley and he used the combination of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=11894)|
| 3:18:19| pavers and a retention pond. So, most likely it would be a combination of those devices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=11899)|
| 3:18:27| Okay. Mr. Taylor, I was able to get to the site, and I see two sets of flooding photos,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=11907)|
| 3:18:32| one from February 23rd and one from January 2020. Is that all the pictures or am I missing something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=11912)|

| 3:18:50| I apologize. I don't have the site up in front of me. I don't know for sure if that's all the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=11930)|
| 3:18:56| photos or that's just all that were put on the site. I did not construct the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=11936)|
| 3:19:01| Okay. Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=11941)|
| 3:19:04| Commissioner Skinmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=11944)|
| 3:19:06| Thank you, Chairman Jay. I think one of the problems with the Zoom format is we miss out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=11946)|
| 3:19:14| on the crowds that attended the previous commission meetings. I certainly can remember when this came| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=11954)|
| 3:19:22| up before that it was probably the largest crowd that we ever had for a zoning meeting that I've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=11962)|
| 3:19:31| experienced. And so, I guess this question is to Commissioner Durrett, since this is your district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=11971)|
| 3:19:38| I kind of want to know what your feelings are on this rezoning request, because you've been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=11978)|
| 3:19:45| in contact with a lot of the neighbors and neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=11985)|
| 3:19:50| Thank you, Commissioner Skinmaker. You're correct. I have been in contact with a lot of people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=11990)|
| 3:19:58| specifically that live on Beverly Road, but also from those neighborhoods that Mr. Taylor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=11998)|
| 3:20:05| mentioned that are downstream of White's Creek and First Creek, Alice Bell, Emerland, Fairmont,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=12005)|
| 3:20:16| which coincidentally is where I grew up and can remember someone canoeing down Broadway from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=12016)|
| 3:20:21| flooding in First Creek when I was young. So, this is not my first go-around with having to deal with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=12021)|
| 3:20:31| flooding issues in my life, and I've heard from all of them. Of course, they would like to see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=12031)|
| 3:20:41| nothing happen to this site, and they are aware that that is not possible now, and so their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=12041)|
| 3:20:46| compromise would be for a one unit per acre recommendation. Okay, thank you. And then I guess| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=12046)|
| 3:20:57| this question is for Gerald Green. We're constantly hearing from the development community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=12057)|
| 3:21:03| affordable housing. Could you describe what, in your opinion, affordable housing is in Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=12063)|
| 3:21:10| at what kind of price ranges or construction standards? Yes, sir, I'll try. Affordable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=12070)|
| 3:21:17| housing is defined as housing that someone can afford, expending 30 percent of their income.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=12077)|
| 3:21:25| So, I think the median income, and just for a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=12085)|
| 3:21:30| first simple math state, I'm going to state that it's $45,000 a year in Knox County. I think that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=12090)|
| 3:21:37| pretty close. So, that means spending $15,000 a year on housing, which is just over a thousand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=12097)|
| 3:21:44| dollars a month, and which I think would buy maybe, I think on current interest rates, about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=12104)|
| 3:21:52| a $200,000 house. So, it's very challenging. We look beyond that to long-term costs and interest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=12112)|
| 3:22:00| rates, and this housing will help the housing market in Knox County just by providing more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=12120)|
| 3:22:10| housing. And speaking with realtors, and before I left, I had lots of conversations with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=12130)|
| 3:22:18| Knoxville Area Association of Realtors and their former director about affordable housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=12138)|

| 3:22:28| by expanding the market and the number of homes available to people. This would address the housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=12148)|
| 3:22:35| issue, and I don't know what the cost would be, because the project is not far enough long in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=12155)|
| 3:22:41| its planning stage to really pinpoint the price of housing, but providing this number of units in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=12161)|
| 3:22:47| this area would certainly help the market and therefore help the affordability of housing in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=12167)|
| 3:22:53| Knox County. Okay, so basically less than $200,000 home is basically classified as affordable housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=12173)|
| 3:23:04| for those at the median income level, and then as you go up in the income,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=12184)|
| 3:23:11| affordability increases obviously. Yes, sir. Okay. Thank you. I'll defer back to Chairman Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=12191)|

| 3:23:37| at any lower rate? Is 2 acceptable or no? No, it wouldn't work out. We thought| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=12217)|
| 3:23:51| just that 172 is about our least number, which I'm sorry, I don't have that in front of me, what that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=12231)|

| 3:24:29| Yes, sir. Thank you. Mr. Gurnard, what did you say the price point of your homes would be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=12269)|
| 3:24:47| We're set up anywhere between 185 and 235 currently with that, and I did get that from,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=12287)|
| 3:24:55| there is a website, what is affordable housing in Knox County, and part of it was a payment of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=12295)|

| 3:25:10| and everything else. And the house that we're building are very energy efficient.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=12310)|
| 3:25:18| And so we've tried to address affordability as a whole house cost, not just the cost of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=12318)|
| 3:25:29| loan, but the utility cost and the upkeep cost and the maintenance cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=12329)|
| 3:25:37| Thank you. I'm not, well, I was going to say I've not seen other hands. Commissioner Biggs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=12337)|
| 3:25:46| have you spoken? Yes, ma'am. Oh, I was going to just go ahead and move forward and make the motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=12346)|
| 3:25:53| that we accept the recommendation by the planning staff. Commissioner Biggs, do you want to speak| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=12353)|
| 3:25:59| first before any motions are in? I just have just a couple quick questions, actually, if that's okay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=12359)|
| 3:26:06| with you. Sure, yeah. If that's okay, Mr. Hill, I just want to give everybody an opportunity to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=12366)|
| 3:26:11| get everything answered. Commissioner Biggs, go ahead. Yes, sir. Earlier, Director Snowden said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=12371)|
| 3:26:16| that he believes that we could clear out that hill, basically scale back some on the hill| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=12376)|
| 3:26:23| for grading for the line of sight distance. I was trying to look it up online. Is that going to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=12383)|
| 3:26:30| like another retention wall? Or what is that going to be? I know we're looking into the zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=12390)|
| 3:26:33| but I'm trying to find something just because I'd hate to see a train coming. And do we know when| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=12393)|
| 3:26:39| trains come through there? I mean, are we going to back up traffic and maybe have rearing collisions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=12399)|
| 3:26:43| Or what? I'm trying to look at that as well online, and I don't really see that much about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=12403)|
| 3:26:52| Sure, Commissioner Biggs. You know, that's one of the things. Until we kind of know a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=12412)|
| 3:26:57| density assigned to the property, it's hard for us to really make, I guess, a really informed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=12417)|
| 3:27:03| decision on how much traffic is coming to the site. And then, you know, and then making decisions on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=12423)|
| 3:27:09| what off-site improvements we may need in regard to does it need a turn lane, you know, a left-in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=12429)|
| 3:27:14| or a right-in. So, some of those questions are really kind of hard for me to specify without| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=12434)|
| 3:27:21| knowing a density, and hence a number of trips that will be generated from the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=12441)|
| 3:27:26| Okay. I appreciate that, Director Snowden. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=12446)|
| 3:27:34| I also see Commissioner Durrett's hand up. So, Commissioner Hill and Commissioner Durrett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=12454)|
| 3:27:41| Commissioner Hill, you want to defer to her right now for a second? Okay. Commissioner Durrett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=12461)|
| 3:27:48| Thank you, Mr. Chairman. My hand was actually up to make a substitute motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=12468)|
| 3:27:53| to her motion if that was going to happen. I think who wants to make a motion? There is no| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=12473)|
| 3:28:00| motion on the floor right now. So, Commissioner Hill, you started to talk about one, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=12480)|
| 3:28:06| Commissioner Durrett as a substitute, do you want to? I'm okay. You can go either way. You started| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=12486)|
| 3:28:13| to make one, but we didn't make one because you deferred. So, what would you like to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=12493)|
| 3:28:17| Commissioner Hill? Well, I will defer to District 2. Okay. Commissioner Durrett,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=12497)|
| 3:28:24| then there is no motion currently on the table. I'm happy to entertain a motion to begin the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=12504)|
| 3:28:31| Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank you, Commissioner Hill, for deferring to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=12511)|
| 3:28:37| Like I said, the community has really expressed their concerns about the flooding that this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=12517)|
| 3:28:45| can potentially cause and exacerbate the current flooding that is there right now. And as we've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=12525)|
| 3:28:51| spoken, it doesn't only affect this immediate surrounding community of this property, but it can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=12531)|
| 3:28:58| have a greater potential of flooding downstream into First Creek. And so, with that being the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=12538)|
| 3:29:07| people's voice, I want to recommend a move forward with a one unit per acre density on this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=12547)|
| 3:29:18| development. So, to restate, your motion would be to approve a one unit per acre? Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=12558)|
| 3:29:24| Is there a second to that motion? Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=12564)|
| 3:29:28| Second by Commissioner Ward. I see Commissioner Daly's hand up regarding that motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=12568)|
| 3:29:34| Yeah, I'd like to make a substitute motion that we go with the recommendation of 2.51| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=12574)|
| 3:29:41| dwelling units per acre. Okay, there's a substitute motion by Commissioner Daly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=12581)|
| 3:29:47| to approve as outlined at 2.51. Is there a second to the substitute motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=12587)|
| 3:29:53| I second. Second by Commissioner Lundy on the substitute motion. So, we must take action on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=12593)|
| 3:29:59| the substitute motion first before considering the original motion. Is there a discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=12599)|
| 3:30:08| on the substitute motion at approval of 2.5? Commissioner Durrett, do you have a discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=12608)|
| 3:30:13| on this particular item or just your hand still up from prior? Okay, thank you very much. Is there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=12613)|
| 3:30:19| a discussion on the substitute motion by Commissioner Daly? Okay, we'll now do a roll| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=12619)|

| 3:49:59| colored piece of paper when we would mail people information, but we do our best to try to remind| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=13799)|
| 3:50:05| them on a number of different fronts at the time of application, and then once the planning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=13805)|

| 3:50:15| great job. It's just that the ones that only come before us one time in their lifetime,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=13815)|
| 3:50:20| they do not know the process. So thank you very much. You're welcome. Okay, is there any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=13820)|
| 3:50:26| additional business to come before our zoning meeting? Okay, seeing none, a motion to adjourn| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=13826)|
| 3:50:33| the zoning meeting. So moved. Second. Commissioner Beeler and Commissioner Schoonmaker, this will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=13833)|
| 3:50:41| complete the zoning meeting. We will reconvene the regular commission meeting at 8.45. 8.45.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=13841)|
| 3:50:49| We'll see you on the other Zoom link. Thank you very much. This meeting is adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=13849)|
| 3:50:53| Madam Clerk, we are going to reconvene this Knox County Commission meeting. I see all members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=13853)|
| 3:51:01| present. We were on item number 25. And before we call on our next set of commissioners for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=13861)|
| 3:51:11| continued discussion, I did receive a message from former Commissioner Hammond and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=13871)|
| 3:51:20| Criminal Court Clerk Hammond to address Commission for just a minute. So,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=13880)|
| 3:51:25| sir, if you want to jump right back in for just a quick minute before we continue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=13885)|
| 3:51:29| Great, thank you so much, commissioners. During the break, I had an opportunity to huddle with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=13889)|
| 3:51:33| my financial people. And I wanted to throw this out to you because I know that funding, you're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=13893)|
| 3:51:38| doing exactly what you're supposed to do. And that's vetting anything that is going to come in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=13898)|
| 3:51:43| and require an expenditure of funds. And I applaud you for that. My job is to make sure that the court| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=13903)|
| 3:51:49| functions properly. And that's what we're doing here. And so what I wanted to do was tell you that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=13909)|
| 3:51:55| because of the funding, I want to put my money where my mouth is. I'm prepared to write Knox| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=13915)|
| 3:51:59| County a check in the morning for $300,000 coming from the excess fee account. I'm also committing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=13919)|
| 3:52:06| to you another $300,000, which I believe we will get as the courts get up and going over the next| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=13926)|
| 3:52:12| six to nine months. So I'm willing to commit to you $600,000. I don't think it's going to be a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=13932)|
| 3:52:17| $1.5 million project, but I'm willing to commit to $600,000. And why am I doing that? Well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=13937)|
| 3:52:23| I didn't know much about the court system before I took this job. I see it every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=13943)|
| 3:52:27| I see exactly what the needs are. I know that our judges are 100% behind this. It is a necessity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=13947)|
| 3:52:33| I've told you about the laptops going into the pods, the noise, et cetera, et cetera. That's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=13953)|
| 3:52:39| one aspect of it. But we're looking at the entire court system here. This will benefit the entire| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=13959)|
| 3:52:43| court system. I just feel like the people need to have some privacy. They need to have something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=13963)|
| 3:52:48| quiet and there needs to be some dignity as opposed to being in a pod where they're flushing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=13968)|
| 3:52:53| toilets. So I just wanted you to know that I'm committed to do that. I'll write a check| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=13973)|
| 3:52:57| in the morning for $300,000 if you all choose to do that this evening. There is a caveat,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=13977)|
| 3:53:02| of course, when I turn over money, it goes to Knox County. It's up to you folks to appropriate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=13982)|
| 3:53:06| it. And so I'm willing to do that with the understanding that you folks would appropriate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=13986)|
| 3:53:11| it toward this video court. So thank you so much for listening. Thank you, Clerk Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=13991)|
| 3:53:16| I'm going to pick up on our discussion where we left off. That was with Commissioner Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=13996)|
| 3:53:20| Commissioner Hill?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=14000)|
| 3:53:25| Well, am I here a hard act to follow? Good lord. That's quite an offer. That's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=14005)|
| 3:53:36| much appreciated. I do have just some comments, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=14016)|
| 3:53:50| Mr. Hammond, I heard you say, and I heard others, a few others allude to the fact that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=14030)|
| 3:54:00| you all have a stakeholders meeting with, I understand it's your judges and other folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=14040)|
| 3:54:06| that come together weekly or biweekly, pretty regularly just to discuss the workings of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=14046)|
| 3:54:12| court and to keep things running smoothly. I also heard you say that about three or four| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=14052)|
| 3:54:20| months ago, this started coming about, this need. And that kind of just goes back to my| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=14060)|
| 3:54:30| whole concern initially about this project. Is it truly a genuine need or is it something that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=14070)|
| 3:54:41| at this moment is being heavily driven by our situation with COVID and all the adjustments that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=14081)|
| 3:54:53| everyone's had to make from beginning to end? Truly, even though it might not have been just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=14093)|
| 3:54:59| two or three weeks ago, the powers that be came up with this idea by your own words. It has been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=14099)|
| 3:55:08| in the last three or four months. So that concerns me greatly because I do believe there is going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=14108)|
| 3:55:16| be an end to this whole scenario, hopefully sooner than later. But we are already, I believe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=14116)|
| 3:55:25| seeing things start to improve in that regard. Of course, your judges are in favor of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=14125)|
| 3:55:37| How could you really not be in favor of it? Being in favor of something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=14137)|
| 3:55:47| and I'm not saying it's true in this situation, but doesn't necessarily equal a really genuine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=14147)|
| 3:55:53| need. And maybe it is there, maybe it's been there all along and it's just something that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=14153)|
| 3:56:02| the courts have just managed to do without. As I said, all of the information was just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=14162)|
| 3:56:10| a little bit new to me on this. So it isn't that I'm opposed to the idea per se, but I am very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=14170)|
| 3:56:22| opposed to knee-jerk in spending funds, even though you've reduced that amount greatly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=14182)|
| 3:56:30| because you are going to be passing surplus monies over. I just hate to get into something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=14190)|
| 3:56:38| like that where down the road we find out it's not something that we genuinely really had to have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=14198)|
| 3:56:44| I mean, we have heard the sheriff talk about his desperate need for more beds out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=14204)|
| 3:56:49| You know, a million dollars isn't a great amount, but you know, it might buy a bed or two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=14209)|
| 3:56:58| And I know too that we've got real issues with our mental health. So many of our prisoners have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=14218)|
| 3:57:06| really dual diagnosis and have serious, serious mental health needs. And just wondering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=14226)|
| 3:57:13| if perhaps that monies would not be better diverted toward, I don't know, maybe putting in a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=14233)|
| 3:57:22| virtual courtroom over at Helen Ross McNabb, where they bring these folks in that have been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=14242)|
| 3:57:30| picked up at the discretion of the sheriff or the police because they do need some immediate help,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=14250)|
| 3:57:36| yet they need incarceration. I mean, I've talked to no one about that except just to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=14256)|
| 3:57:43| recognize in my own mind how the two are so intertwined and we're so much needing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=14263)|
| 3:57:51| you know, recognizing the need for that. So, I mean, really, I don't know about the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=14271)|
| 3:57:58| civil rights involved. I'm not an attorney. I do have concerns about this Rule 43.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=14278)|
| 3:58:11| I mean, the what ifs. We do go back to the way things were prior to the suspension of this rule| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=14291)|
| 3:58:19| and then we've got those courtrooms sitting out there and that, in fact, could not be utilized| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=14299)|
| 3:58:25| the way that we hoped. Not never, but not to the amount that we hoped. Again, because of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=14305)|
| 3:58:32| rules of our state Supreme Court, not because of anything, you know, we've done here locally. So,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=14312)|
| 3:58:39| those are just all things that have come to mind these last few days as I have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=14319)|
| 3:58:44| really tried to think through these issues. So, I don't know that that even requires a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=14324)|
| 3:58:51| response from anyone, but those are just concerns that I've had trying to look at the big| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=14331)|
| 3:58:57| picture and all this. Oh, and I do have one more thing to say. I've worked with Tim Irwin for years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=14337)|
| 3:59:03| You tell him he just needs to get on Zoom. This Skype business is for the birds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=14343)|
| 3:59:09| He, you know, he can get a computer and go sit in his courtroom like he always does. And I cannot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=14349)|
| 3:59:17| believe, I just cannot believe that at the detention facility there isn't some small room| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=14357)|
| 3:59:24| someplace, even if a worker has to surrender their office for an hour or two a day to let| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=14364)|
| 3:59:35| these incarcerated prisoners for child support that cannot walk in and have a few moments of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=14375)|
| 3:59:41| privacy while they're dealing with our judge. So, anyway. Thank you, Commissioner Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=14381)|
| 3:59:48| With that Zoom program. I would like to respond if that would be appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=14388)|
| 3:59:54| Okay, well, thank you. I'll sure tell Judge Irwin what you said. Yeah, I know he'll appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=14394)|
| 4:00:01| Well, Commissioner, again, thank you for your questions. They're very good questions. This is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=14401)|
| 4:00:05| not a knee-jerk reaction. Again, we've been talking about this for quite some time. What| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=14405)|
| 4:00:08| the judges tried to do was the sessions judges and the criminal judges tried to work out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=14408)|
| 4:00:14| a system whereby the sessions judges would use the cameras that are available| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=14414)|
| 4:00:19| and then switch over to the criminal judges. But we found out that wasn't working well because you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=14419)|
| 4:00:24| can't set a time frame and say, okay, we'll do an hour and a half. It might be two hours or more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=14424)|
| 4:00:31| just on sessions cases. And so you had your criminal judges waiting, trying to get access| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=14431)|
| 4:00:36| to the cameras. Now, again, you mentioned the totality. That's one of the things I want to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=14436)|
| 4:00:41| emphasize is this, the totality of what we're talking about. Already our magistrates are using| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=14441)|
| 4:00:47| it through Skype. They're taking laptops into the pods. They're doing it three times a day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=14447)|
| 4:00:53| Over 5,000 people last year were treated this way. And then when you look at what Judge Irwin's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=14453)|
| 4:01:00| doing, he's been doing it for two years, and they do it three times a morning. And they'll have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=14460)|
| 4:01:04| anywhere from 10 to 18 people per day. And we're wanting to expand this to perhaps Magistrate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=14464)|
| 4:01:11| Lindsay McDaniel's court, where she also does child support. Judge McMillan, who has orders of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=14471)|
| 4:01:18| protection, has already said he does 10 to 15 a month. He would love to be able to do this as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=14478)|
| 4:01:22| opposed to having them come down and wait and go into his courtroom for two minutes and then have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=14482)|
| 4:01:26| to be sent all the way back to the detention facility. So my point is I would like for you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=14486)|
| 4:01:32| to look at the total picture because this will be used. It's not something that's just going to go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=14492)|
| 4:01:37| away. And let's say the pandemic stops tomorrow. The judges have already said in writing it's a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=14497)|
| 4:01:43| necessity, and they will use it past the pandemic. So I have a lot of confidence in our judges,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=14503)|
| 4:01:49| and I believe that this is the right way to go and the right thing to do for our court functions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=14509)|
| 4:01:54| Thank you, Mr. Hammond, and thank you, Ms. Hill. Next up is Commissioner Durrett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=14514)|
| 4:02:02| Thank you, Mr. Chair. I had a question. I'm not sure who exactly this would be for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=14522)|
| 4:02:10| but it has to deal with, I know Sheriff Spengler said earlier when he was here that they would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=14530)|
| 4:02:17| accepting plea agreements through this, and it was my understanding that that would not be possible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=14537)|
| 4:02:22| under Rule 43 once the Supreme Court order expires. Can someone elaborate on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=14542)|
| 4:02:34| Yeah, that would be accurate. Absent some change in the rule, what Rule 43 lays out is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=14554)|
| 4:02:41| audio, where you're permitted to use audiovisual equipment to have a person appear remotely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=14561)|
| 4:02:49| The Supreme Court's order, because of the pandemic, in response to the pandemic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=14569)|
| 4:02:53| has specifically suspended Rule 43 and has basically opened it up to allow us to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=14573)|
| 4:02:59| many different types of proceedings using audiovisual technology.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=14579)|
| 4:03:05| It is my reading of the law and my belief that unless that rule is changed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=14585)|
| 4:03:09| it would not be permissible to do plea agreements remotely once that Supreme Court order expires.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=14589)|
| 4:03:17| In terms of whether or not there are constitutional issues, I think that that's something that would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=14597)|
| 4:03:21| have to be litigated. I don't know if—candidly, I don't know the answer to that. It does strike me as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=14601)|
| 4:03:28| somewhat interesting that the Supreme Court at least sort of considers that as an option,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=14608)|
| 4:03:35| that there might be constitutional issues, because in the order that they've sent out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=14615)|
| 4:03:39| the most recent one, dated December the 22nd of 2020, actually had a line in there that in-person| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=14619)|
| 4:03:46| proceedings were suspended, but it listed plea agreements as an exception to that. I'm not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=14626)|
| 4:03:50| 100 percent certain if we are completely adhering to the order or not, but that is what it is. I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=14630)|
| 4:03:58| don't know if the Supreme Court would want to change that or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=14638)|
| 4:04:01| Okay. And will someone please remind me the answer—I believe the question was from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=14641)|
| 4:04:08| Commissioner Lundy on in-person access to lawyers. Was that answered—it was right before we ended| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=14648)|
| 4:04:18| to go to zoning?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=14658)|
| 4:04:21| I spoke to that somewhat. I think that what has been proposed, and I'm sure Mr. Hammond will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=14661)|
| 4:04:29| correct me if I misstate this, but I believe that what has been proposed is that you would have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=14669)|
| 4:04:33| six sort of virtual courtrooms, and then I believe that they also had anticipated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=14673)|
| 4:04:38| six rooms off of that where someone could go and take a phone call from their lawyer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=14678)|
| 4:04:47| And I do want to say that while that certainly does provide you some access to your client,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=14687)|
| 4:04:53| it is not the same being able to have a face-to-face conversation with someone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=14693)|
| 4:05:00| in order to instead have that conversation telephonically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=14700)|
| 4:05:05| Okay. Thank you, Mr. Lutton. I understand that technology is the future and that we need to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=14705)|
| 4:05:15| progress with it as we can, but also at the same time, we don't need to—I feel like this is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=14715)|
| 4:05:22| becoming more of let's push it through, let's save money in this term of being processed versus| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=14722)|
| 4:05:28| administering justice, and so that's where my concerns lie. But thank you, everyone, for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=14728)|
| 4:05:34| your remarks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=14734)|
| 4:05:36| Thank you, Commissioner Durrett. Next up is Commissioner Beeler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=14736)|
| 4:05:41| Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Wow. I guess two or three things here. One, I want to just start| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=14741)|
| 4:05:50| out by saying, you know, I know we've gotten some emails—at least I've gotten them, I assume other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=14750)|
| 4:05:54| commissioners have gotten them too—that have directed their opposition to this toward the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=14754)|
| 4:06:00| Sheriff's Department, and I don't know that that's entirely fair. As, you know, Sheriff Spangler| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=14760)|
| 4:06:05| stated this, the sheriff is only one player in this, and I'm confident that if Sheriff Spangler| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=14765)|
| 4:06:14| were going to ask for a million and a half dollars to solely benefit his organization,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=14774)|
| 4:06:20| it probably would not be for this. At least it wouldn't be the first thing on the list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=14780)|
| 4:06:25| So, you know, there's certainly numerous stakeholders, and that's been well stated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=14785)|
| 4:06:29| tonight. When I first heard about this, I definitely did have some concerns,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=14789)|
| 4:06:35| constitutional concerns, civil rights concerns, those sorts of things, and those have been brought| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=14795)|
| 4:06:40| certainly rights to representation, rights to face one's accusers, and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=14800)|
| 4:06:48| It appears to me from everything I'm hearing that those rights would be preserved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=14808)|
| 4:06:57| In other words, there would be certain types of proceedings that simply would have to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=14817)|
| 4:07:03| done in person and would continue to be done in person, and any defendant would be able to at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=14823)|
| 4:07:08| least appeal to a judge to ask, to request that his proceedings, his or her proceedings, be done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=14828)|
| 4:07:16| in person. And so this comes down to the fact that we are using video for certain proceedings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=14836)|
| 4:07:28| Certainly under Rule 43, or whatever is being referred to as what the Supreme Court has put| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=14848)|
| 4:07:34| down that's going to expire, I assume April 1st, will theoretically will go back to normal. Now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=14854)|
| 4:07:42| we don't know that for sure, obviously, based on how COVID is going to behave, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=14862)|
| 4:07:49| you know, even were that to happen, there would still be some things that are done remotely by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=14869)|
| 4:07:56| video. And I think one issue would be, we need to improve the quality of how that's done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=14876)|
| 4:08:07| I mean, even if we're only doing, even if we're doing fewer things by video than we are currently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=14887)|
| 4:08:15| in the COVID pandemic, anything we do on video needs to be done in as high quality a way as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=14895)|
| 4:08:20| possibly can. And I think this is going to improve that if this facility is built.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=14900)|
| 4:08:27| I hate to think that this is just sort of haphazardly, you know, laptops being put,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=14907)|
| 4:08:31| passed into pods and, you know, going into this person's office or that person's office. I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=14911)|
| 4:08:36| there needs to be a consistent place and way in which this is done that's as high quality as it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=14916)|
| 4:08:43| can be done. And, you know, anytime something new begins to become more normative, it's always| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=14923)|
| 4:08:58| hard for the people that use whatever that thing is on a regular basis to imagine. Case in point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=14938)|
| 4:09:09| you know, I worked in the registrar's office for 31 years and I can remember 30 years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=14949)|
| 4:09:14| no one could imagine property records being electronic rather than paper. And yet it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=14954)|
| 4:09:22| happened. And even as recently as 10 or 15 years ago, I could not have imagined property records| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=14962)|
| 4:09:31| being recorded electronically and there not being a piece of paper with ink, original ink,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=14971)|
| 4:09:39| and a raised notary seal that's actually brought to the registrar's office and presented to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=14979)|
| 4:09:44| registrar to be authenticated in that way that there would actually be an electronic way that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=14984)|
| 4:09:49| that could be done for something as vital as property records. And yet here we are in 2021| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=14989)|
| 4:09:54| and both of those things have become the norm. And so even though I hope that constitutionally| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=14994)|
| 4:10:05| in-person hearings don't go away and certainly the right to jury trial and sentencing and things of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=15005)|
| 4:10:11| that nature would still be done face to face, even if this type of technology moves forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=15011)|
| 4:10:17| incremental in the justice system, we got to be prepared for that. And this is an opportunity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=15017)|
| 4:10:23| I feel like, where, you know, the money's there and the need is there. It's certainly there in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=15023)|
| 4:10:31| the short term. I don't think it's going to go away in the long term. And so, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=15031)|
| 4:10:39| short of my constitutional concerns, I think one of the most important jobs of this body is to make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=15039)|
| 4:10:45| sure that all of our offices, including our judiciary and law enforcement, are equipped| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=15045)|
| 4:10:52| to do their jobs as well as they possibly can while preserving the basic rights of individuals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=15052)|
| 4:10:59| And so I would lean toward trusting the judges and the clerk and the sheriff that this will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=15059)|
| 4:11:09| be stewarded well and this will be useful in carrying out their duties. So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=15069)|
| 4:11:15| Mr. Chairman, Commissioner, might I respond briefly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=15075)|
| 4:11:19| Yes, sir. We've got a few more comments. So very sure. Absolutely. Well, we'll be here as long as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=15079)|
| 4:11:23| you want us to be here. Commissioner Beeler, when I took over the clerk's office, as you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=15083)|
| 4:11:29| we were woefully behind the technology. We had people still using typewriters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=15089)|
| 4:11:33| So we have come leaps and bounds from where we were. I use the mantra in the court system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=15093)|
| 4:11:39| Our mantra was today's technology tomorrow. And so it was very, very difficult to try to get folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=15099)|
| 4:11:45| to come on board. But once they did, they found out it works well, just like you did in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=15105)|
| 4:11:49| registrar's office. I might also add we're already doing video in Nashville with the Department of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=15109)|
| 4:11:56| Corrections. And so we have the state put it in. And so right now in our criminal, at least one of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=15116)|
| 4:12:02| our criminal courtrooms, we can access the Department of Corrections in Nashville and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=15122)|
| 4:12:06| they can actually have proceedings there. And so I say that to say this is the wave of the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=15126)|
| 4:12:13| And we have an opportunity now to do this. And I'm convinced it's not going to trample on people's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=15133)|
| 4:12:18| constitutional rights. Nobody wants that. But, you know, the judges have said it ain't going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=15138)|
| 4:12:23| happen. They're under a Supreme Court dictate to make sure it doesn't happen. But we also need to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=15143)|
| 4:12:30| understand that this is going to help us be more efficient with what we already have. Again, I go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=15150)|
| 4:12:35| back to what's going on in the pods, like you mentioned, the laptops. So I would appreciate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=15155)|
| 4:12:40| thank you for your comments. Commissioner Skinmaker, I'm going to continue with first| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=15160)|
| 4:12:44| round comments before we go to a second round comments. For those who have spoken on the topic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=15164)|
| 4:12:48| Commissioner Skinmaker. Thank you, Chairman J. Clerk Hammond, I was very impressed in your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=15168)|
| 4:12:56| letter to the commissioners that you did reach out to another county in Tennessee that has a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=15176)|
| 4:13:03| video courtroom and you referenced Chattanooga, or as we know it as Hamilton County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=15183)|
| 4:13:10| and they're using it in their criminal courts. And I believe in the correspondence, you said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=15190)|
| 4:13:15| they've been using it for about two years or more. Is that correct? Yes, I touched base with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=15195)|
| 4:13:20| criminal court clerk in Hamilton County, Vince Dean, and he told me that they have been using| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=15200)|
| 4:13:25| it two to three years. They have three criminal divisions like we do. And each division has its| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=15205)|
| 4:13:30| own quote video courtroom. So they've been doing this for two to three years. And this was even| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=15210)|
| 4:13:35| before the pandemic. And so they have been able to use it effectively. And so the hope is, is that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=15215)|
| 4:13:41| we and I'm sure that that's what we would do as well as is use it effectively. Okay, great. And| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=15221)|
| 4:13:48| so I'm assuming that we've got some competent civil rights attorneys in Hamilton County, that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=15228)|
| 4:13:54| if they were violating the rights of individuals in Tennessee, that one of those individuals would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=15234)|
| 4:14:00| file suit in Hamilton County, but that apparently has not happened. So this video courtroom doesn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=15240)|
| 4:14:06| violate people's rights as we possibly heard earlier in public forum. And then the other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=15246)|
| 4:14:13| question I had is that if we move to a virtual or video courtroom, does that bar the members of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=15253)|
| 4:14:21| public defender's office from appearing with the with the individual in the courtroom as opposed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=15261)|
| 4:14:29| to being on the phone? Are they prohibited from going to Maloneyville Road facility and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=15269)|
| 4:14:36| participating in the video courtroom? I can speak to that. I do not believe that we would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=15276)|
| 4:14:44| be prohibited from doing so. But I think logistically, you have to understand what it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=15284)|
| 4:14:49| like to walk into court with 25 cases on the docket. And if you have and I think the way that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=15289)|
| 4:14:56| this is envisioned is that, you know, attorneys typically go into court and then they get in line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=15296)|
| 4:15:00| And then when you get to the front of the line, you get to call your case up. And so if you have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=15300)|
| 4:15:05| some of your clients that are physically present in the courthouse, and some of your clients that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=15305)|
| 4:15:08| are that are physically out of Maloneyville Road, we, you know, as an attorney, you can't be in two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=15308)|
| 4:15:12| different places at once. And so it is not unusual for public defenders to have five different courts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=15312)|
| 4:15:17| or six different courts that they have to be in any given day. It is not unusual to have, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=15317)|
| 4:15:22| a dozen, a couple dozen cases, depending on what your case assignments look like that day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=15322)|
| 4:15:26| on the docket. And so leaving the courthouse, driving out to Maloneyville to stand beside| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=15326)|
| 4:15:31| your client there, then getting back in your car, driving back to the city county building to try| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=15331)|
| 4:15:34| and take up the other cases you have is would not be would not be possible. There are there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=15334)|
| 4:15:41| are rare days when you only have a couple of cases on the docket. And in that instance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=15341)|
| 4:15:45| one certainly could if all of their cases were individuals out at Maloneyville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=15345)|
| 4:15:50| Okay. Well, but once this this, if this goes forward, and once this courtroom is established,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=15350)|
| 4:15:57| possibly scheduling then could be consideration for the time of the public defenders, and that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=15357)|
| 4:16:04| could be worked out. But anyways, Mr. Chairman, I see we have one more hand up, but I'm ready to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=15364)|
| 4:16:10| vote on this issue. Thank you very much, Mr. Schoonmaker. Commissioner Daly, second round| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=15370)|
| 4:16:16| comment. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Hammond. That $300,000 if you don't give it to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=15376)|
| 4:16:28| I'm turning it over anyway. So I was just saying that I have the money. And I'm happy to turn it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=15388)|
| 4:16:33| over to you all in the morning to pay for this video courtroom. But again, that's your money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=15393)|
| 4:16:37| when I turn it over, so I can't tell you how to spend it. I'm just making an offer that I can do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=15397)|
| 4:16:42| that. And I'm pretty confident we could do another $300,000 that you could allocate toward it if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=15402)|
| 4:16:47| funding is an issue. Well, I took it that you said that if it didn't pass, you wouldn't turn that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=15407)|
| 4:16:53| money over. So oh, no, no, no, you're gonna get the money. It's just that I just want to make sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=15413)|
| 4:16:57| you all knew that you could that you could apply it. I just wanted you to clear that up. Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=15417)|
| 4:17:05| Sheriff Spangler. I don't know if Sheriff Spangler's back on yet. He texted that he was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=15425)|
| 4:17:13| on his way back, but I do see him actually. I don't see him, but I see his box. Sheriff Spangler,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=15433)|
| 4:17:19| are you still with us? I'm on there. I just don't have our video capability right yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=15439)|
| 4:17:24| Go ahead, Commissioner Daley. Sheriff, we've heard in some of our meetings that a lot of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=15444)|
| 4:17:31| inmates are waiting on a judge to decide to either give them bonds or get them to their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=15451)|
| 4:17:37| first hearing and which was a really high percentage. Am I stating that correctly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=15457)|
| 4:17:45| Are you talking about they're just having to wait for arraignment? Is that what you're talking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=15465)|
| 4:17:49| about? Yes. Well, once they come to court, now they may be there a while because of the case| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=15469)|
| 4:18:00| because of the cases and depend on how many people they've brought in. So,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=15480)|
| 4:18:03| that could be possible. Yes. Could we cut that time down with the video court?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=15483)|
| 4:18:09| Well, as soon as they get up there, then obviously they do. But then what happens if they finish the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=15489)|
| 4:18:15| case right then, then that individual, once they do the release on them, they're taken downtown| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=15495)|
| 4:18:20| immediately instead of being taken back out to the facility and then brought back to the downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=15500)|
| 4:18:27| So, there are ways for this video court to work in the future. There's no doubt. And| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=15507)|
| 4:18:33| I see it as an efficient issue. Eric and I had a discussion last week. I think he could work it out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=15513)|
| 4:18:41| to where, like Commissioner Schoonmaker said, that they do scheduling. One day it'd be video| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=15521)|
| 4:18:47| court. One day it'd be at downtown. It's just about scheduling. Just because we did it one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=15527)|
| 4:18:52| way all the time, don't mean that we can't look for better, more efficient ways to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=15532)|
| 4:19:00| I think this is a good thing. I think it's going to be used.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=15540)|
| 4:19:03| We've been threatened on County Commission to be sued many, many times and we probably end up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=15543)|
| 4:19:08| getting sued. But that brings to my next question. Law Director, are you there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=15548)|
| 4:19:16| I'm here. Hey, you've been sitting here listening to this and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=15556)|
| 4:19:20| the 43 and the citizens' rights and all that. So, I don't think any of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=15560)|
| 4:19:29| The judges are not going to put us in a position to where we will be sued. I don't think they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=15569)|
| 4:19:34| would do that. So, I want to give you the opportunity to fill in from the taxpayer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=15574)|
| 4:19:40| side as you're the Law Director, what you think about all the conversation that's been going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=15580)|
| 4:19:46| Well, it's been good conversation and I'm not going to enter into the merits of the policy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=15586)|
| 4:19:51| decision one way or the other. But I was concerned that there were some talk about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=15591)|
| 4:19:57| threats of lawsuits. Well, us lawyers just don't listen to threats of lawsuits. It doesn't bother| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=15597)|
| 4:20:04| us, but it should bother the taxpayers. But keep in mind this, these people that go into the judicial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=15604)|
| 4:20:13| system, we can't be sued for what happens in the judicial system. No way. The judges| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=15613)|
| 4:20:21| have absolute immunity under law. Whatever the judges do has to be dealt with. If the defendant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=15621)|
| 4:20:30| is in disagreement, he files a criminal court of appeals. With regard to the federal lawsuits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=15630)|
| 4:20:37| they just can't happen. They won't happen. Contrary to what's been represented to this body| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=15637)|
| 4:20:47| in Chattanooga, I have seen no lawsuits come out of what Chattanooga has been doing for the last| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=15647)|
| 4:20:53| two or three years. Additionally, this office reads every single case that comes out of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=15653)|
| 4:20:59| Sixth Circuit Federal Court of Appeals where all these civil rights suits are filed. Every single| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=15659)|
| 4:21:06| case, they come down, several of them a day. I have not seen in this Sixth Circuit, which includes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=15666)|
| 4:21:12| Tennessee, Kentucky, Ohio, and Michigan, I have not seen one case in which a civil rights violation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=15672)|
| 4:21:20| was even asserted with regard to any kind of action taken by the judiciary in these states,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=15680)|
| 4:21:29| whether it be by virtual that we're talking about or whatever. It just doesn't happen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=15689)|
| 4:21:37| and the absolute immunity takes that away. The sheriff cannot be sued for what the judges do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=15697)|
| 4:21:43| so he's got immunity on that. This commission cannot be sued if this commission decides| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=15703)|
| 4:21:50| that this is the way that they want to do and build this building. The threat of a civil rights| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=15710)|
| 4:21:56| lawsuit is just, in my opinion, non-existent. And the other thing is it bothered me. There's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=15716)|
| 4:22:02| an implication. I know these judges. I know every single one of them personally. We have good judges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=15722)|
| 4:22:09| They know what they're doing. None of these judges is going to let anything violate the civil rights| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=15729)|
| 4:22:18| and the constitutional rights of these people coming before them. It just is not going to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=15738)|
| 4:22:24| And to make the implication that there would be a violation of civil rights for a judge allowing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=15744)|
| 4:22:30| something to go on like that is just, well, for whatever word, it's balderdash. It just is not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=15750)|
| 4:22:36| possible. These judges are too good. They're not going to let it happen. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=15756)|
| 4:22:41| Thank you, Mr. Law Director. Mr. Chairman, if you don't have a comment, I'll call for the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=15761)|
| 4:22:46| If you have a comment, that's good. Could I respond very briefly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=15766)|
| 4:22:51| I'll call for the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=15771)|
| 4:22:59| You're on mute, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=15779)|
| 4:23:03| I'm getting T-shirts made. I'm going to let Mr. Lutton respond very quickly. I'm going to have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=15783)|
| 4:23:09| a final comment, and then we'll move to a vote. Yeah, I just want to be very clear that I was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=15789)|
| 4:23:15| not suggesting that there would be lawsuits. And I was not at all suggesting that our judges would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=15795)|
| 4:23:20| intentionally violate anyone's rights. I know we've got good judges in Knox County, and I'm also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=15800)|
| 4:23:24| friends with all of the judges. I guess the point that I was trying to illustrate was that some of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=15804)|
| 4:23:30| the ways that I had heard that the facility might be proposed to be used, we might not be permitted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=15810)|
| 4:23:35| to use it that way simply because the judges would rule correctly that, hey, you can't use it for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=15815)|
| 4:23:40| pleas unless they change the rule. And so I just wanted to clarify that point that I was not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=15820)|
| 4:23:46| suggesting that the judges would be violating anyone's rights, merely that we might be limited| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=15826)|
| 4:23:51| to what we could and could not do with the facility because the judges will be bound by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=15831)|
| 4:23:55| Supreme Court rules. Thank you for that clarification. I thought that was very clear, so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=15835)|
| 4:24:00| I'm happy to have it reiterated. Just one final comment before we vote. However this vote goes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=15840)|
| 4:24:06| if it is approved, then I would like to ask Sheriff Spangler and Mike Hammond to provide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=15846)|

| 4:24:23| what is being done, and as a snapshot in time, looking forward every quarter, provide us with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=15863)|
| 4:24:29| some sort of report that shows if, again, if this is approved, that it is effective and that we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=15869)|
| 4:24:36| some understanding of how it is being used in a way that we have not yet been provided that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=15876)|
| 4:24:42| information. I'm sure that Mr. Hammond and Sheriff Spangler can work together to provide this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=15882)|
| 4:24:46| commission information. Every decision we make sometimes takes some time to understand, did it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=15886)|
| 4:24:52| work, can we do it better, can we do, you know, make adjustments, and I would appreciate some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=15892)|
| 4:24:57| more information as we move forward, again, if this were to be approved today. So I'll leave it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=15897)|
| 4:25:04| at that and move to a vote. I don't see any additional hands raised, so Madam Chair. Yes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=15904)|
| 4:25:10| sir. I'll withdraw my call for the question so we can go straight to the vote instead of a call| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=15910)|
| 4:25:17| for the question. Okay. Thank you, Commissioner Daly. So this is a vote. We had a first from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=15917)|
| 4:25:22| Commissioner Daly and a second from Commissioner Smith to approve item number 25. That is what you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=15922)|

| 4:33:09| accessibility. The parking lot is relatively flat. There are several| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=16389)|

| 4:34:53| to be able to have it. So this space offered us that predictability. If I give you a vaccine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=16493)|

| 4:38:46| understood what they were looking for and accessibility of the site was of paramount| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=16726)|
| 4:38:53| importance as well as flow within these. That's why we're kind of looking at a big box type| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=16733)|
| 4:38:59| of area. We can separate people in an area like this. You know, there's 40,000, 50,000 square feet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=16739)|
| 4:39:06| and you can get quite a few people in there six feet apart. Once we found two or three suitable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=16746)|
| 4:39:15| ones and we engaged the health department personnel and they actually kind of went out with us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=16755)|
| 4:39:21| and thought, yes, this will work. And no, that wouldn't work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=16761)|
| 4:39:27| Can you, my head off a public records request, you probably want to send us an email or whatever| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=16767)|
| 4:39:34| the sites that you did visit. That would be something I would do, the name of the sites.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=16774)|
| 4:39:42| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=16782)|
| 4:39:44| Yeah, sure. I'll send you a list of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=16784)|
| 4:39:51| Man, I had one more question, but I apologize for that. So thank you, Matt. Thank you, Dr. B.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=16791)|
| 4:40:00| Thank you, Commissioner Daley. Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=16800)|
| 4:40:02| Thank you, Chairman J. Mr. Myers, I just wanted to say I really appreciate your opening comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=16802)|
| 4:40:10| I think people that are watching this broadcast probably don't understand how difficult the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=16810)|
| 4:40:18| decisions that the procurement team does for Knox County. And I just I really appreciate it. And I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=16818)|
| 4:40:25| think that exemplifies, you know, the standards of all of our departments in Knox County with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=16825)|
| 4:40:31| you coming out and making the statement you did. And I appreciate what you guys are doing for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=16831)|
| 4:40:36| And it's one of those where you can never make the right decision. It's a no win situation a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=16836)|
| 4:40:42| lot of times. But personally, I really appreciate what you do for us. Thank you. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=16842)|
| 4:40:49| Thank you very much. Is there any other questions or comments for item number 37?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=16849)|
| 4:40:53| Commissioner Biggs. Thank you, Chairman. Can you anybody direct me in all this data where the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=16853)|
| 4:41:02| actual dollar amount is that Commissioner Daley was talking about the additional funding for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=16862)|
| 4:41:07| basically the setup at the food city that he was speaking on earlier, I was looking for and I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=16867)|
| 4:41:12| couldn't find it. Additional funding, sorry. Basically open the doors, ready to start| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=16872)|
| 4:41:29| administering the shots. What additional funding is or what was that going to cost as well was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=16889)|
| 4:41:35| kind of the direction that I was listening to earlier. Maybe I wasn't listening in the right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=16895)|
| 4:41:39| way. But I thought that's what we were getting that. Matt, I'm not clear on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=16899)|
| 4:41:49| I think the question is beyond the lease agreement at $57 a month. Is there any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=16909)|
| 4:41:54| additional funding needed to open the doors and begin vaccination?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=16914)|
| 4:41:58| Exactly. I believe Kevin Parton from my department is on. He may be able to answer that question. I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=16918)|
| 4:42:05| know that we've purchased some tables and chairs and things like that. So Kevin, do you have that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=16925)|
| 4:42:13| information? Mr. Parton, if you would just identify yourself for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=16933)|
| 4:42:17| Kevin Parton, Knox County Health Department. The only additional things that we need to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=16937)|
| 4:42:22| we purchased tables and chairs, as Dr. Buchanan said, and that was approximately $13,000 total| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=16942)|
| 4:42:30| for 50 tables and 150 chairs. We'll have to get internet service so that we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=16950)|
| 4:42:41| networking capabilities, things of that nature. All of the funds that we spend will be reimbursed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=16961)|
| 4:42:48| to the county through our ELC grant. So I don't expect anything to go awry there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=16968)|
| 4:42:54| Okay. So does that grant, does that also offer the opportunity for, you know, your social| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=16974)|
| 4:43:02| distancing screens and things of that nature, your Plexiglas and stuff like that, that we're going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=16982)|
| 4:43:06| have to do? Yes, it does. Thank you. You're welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=16986)|
| 4:43:10| I see a second round of questions from Commissioner Daley and then Smith. Commissioner Daley?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=16990)|
| 4:43:15| Yeah, thank you, Mr. Chairman. I don't remember what I was going to say, but that brought up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=16995)|
| 4:43:18| another question. Kevin and Dr. B, we spent $13,000 on tables and chairs. So what are we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=16998)|
| 4:43:27| going to do with these tables and chairs when this pandemic's over with? That's something to look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=17007)|
| 4:43:33| So if you don't have an answer for that, that's fine. Matt, what I was going to say is that I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=17013)|
| 4:43:40| understand the process that you went through. It would take, how many days will it take to do an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=17020)|
| 4:43:45| RFI or an RFQ when we don't have that much time to do something like that? So I just wanted to let| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=17025)|
| 4:43:50| you know, I think I understand why we did this the way we did, because we're looking at 45,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=17030)|
| 4:43:56| 60 days out before we even get a request for information or a proposal. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=17036)|
| 4:44:05| And if I may, Commissioner Daley, we actually will keep some of those tables and chairs for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=17045)|
| 4:44:12| future events. But then we will sell those that we don't need on the government website that I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=17052)|
| 4:44:20| can't think of the name of. It's Gov. GovDeals. GovDeals, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=17060)|
| 4:44:29| Okay, Commissioner Daley, is that all your questions? Okay, thank you very much. I see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=17069)|
| 4:44:35| Commissioner Smith, your hand up as well. Thank you, Mr. Chair. And Matt, I really want to thank| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=17075)|
| 4:44:40| you. I know the job you have and how hard it is and how professional you actually are at it. So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=17080)|
| 4:44:49| I appreciate everything you do, sir. My question on this lease is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=17089)|
| 4:44:57| as distribution of the vaccine becomes more and more available through primary care positions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=17097)|
| 4:45:03| and other outlets, is there a possibility that we may not need a six-month lease,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=17103)|
| 4:45:11| and can it be terminated earlier if we reach that point, Dr. Buchanan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=17111)|
| 4:45:18| Well, I'll say a couple things about that, and then I'll let Matt or Kevin talk specifically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=17118)|
| 4:45:23| about how we, the details of the contract. But what I will say is that the state just issued| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=17123)|
| 4:45:31| a three-year grant for COVID vaccine to health departments to increase vaccine access. So based| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=17131)|
| 4:45:39| on that, the state and federal government anticipate the public health will be very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=17139)|
| 4:45:44| intimately involved in COVID vaccinations going forward for quite some time. So I anticipate that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=17144)|
| 4:45:52| we will continue to need to be involved in that. Our involvement will maybe not decrease.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=17152)|
| 4:45:58| Our involvement will probably stay the same, but other people's involvement will increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=17158)|
| 4:46:02| And so we will continue to be an intimate part of, and a vital part of vaccinating our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=17162)|
| 4:46:09| And of course, there is also talk of potential for boosters to fight against the variant. So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=17169)|
| 4:46:17| I see us continuing to be very engaged in vaccinating the community over quite some time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=17177)|
| 4:46:25| and six months for sure, if not longer. Okay. And Kevin, you had mentioned that this federal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=17185)|
| 4:46:34| grant that we're going to be buying FF&E furniture with that we could liquidate it after we're done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=17194)|
| 4:46:42| Does the grant allow for liquidation of these assets purchased with this money?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=17202)|
| 4:46:48| Yes, sir. They're our assets once we purchase them. They have a typically it's a $5,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=17208)|
| 4:46:55| limit on anything along those lines before it would be tagged as state property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=17215)|
| 4:47:00| Okay. Thank you, sir. Okay. Is there any further discussion on item number 37?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=17220)|
| 4:47:08| Mr. Chairman? Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=17228)|
| 4:47:10| Matt, before we put this on good deals, let's make sure that we don't need these in our schools and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=17230)|
| 4:47:15| all the other places before we sell them a $50 table for $5, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=17235)|
| 4:47:22| Same for centers. Yeah, absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=17242)|
| 4:47:26| Okay. Commissioner Ward? Is there anything else you need from us, Dr. B,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=17246)|
| 4:47:31| to make this faster or smoother? Just approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=17251)|
| 4:47:40| Okay. Seeing no further discussion, we have a proper motion on the table from Commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=17260)|
| 4:47:44| Daly to approve and a second by Commissioner Beeler. Any further discussion? Seeing none,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=17264)|

| 4:49:02| Is there a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=17342)|
| 4:49:03| I move to approve. Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=17343)|

| 4:49:26| I see you there, so you know my question. Just for the record, we're voting on the agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=17366)|
| 4:49:31| We're not voting on the pilot at this point in time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=17371)|
| 4:49:35| Correct. All we're doing is changing the development agreement to extend| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=17375)|
| 4:49:41| the approval period of the pilot to April, and because the third party review did not get done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=17381)|
| 4:49:52| and we're actually joined by Mr. Mabentoff as well, if you have any questions for him,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=17392)|

| 4:50:35| Thank you, Chairman Jay. I guess then it's the will of the body that we continue to pursue a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=17435)|
| 4:50:47| pilot for the Andrew Johnson Building with a positive vote tonight. Is that correct? Or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=17447)|
| 4:50:55| if we don't want to go forward with a pilot for the Andrew Johnson Building, we could deny it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=17455)|
| 4:51:03| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=17463)|
| 4:51:09| If you deny this... Can you identify yourself, sir, for the record?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=17469)|
| 4:51:12| Oh, I'm so sorry. Yes, and I'm sorry. I just got back from vacation. I'm sorry I'm a little bit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=17472)|

| 4:51:23| Knoxville, Tennessee. And Mr. Schoonmaker, you're absolutely correct. If you all did not approve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=17483)|
| 4:51:28| this, the development agreement would end by its terms. But by voting in favor of this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=17488)|
| 4:51:36| please understand you're not supporting a pilot. You're just supporting having the information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=17496)|
| 4:51:40| decide whether you want to give a pilot. It's a complicated calculation because of the transition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=17500)|
| 4:51:47| from apartments to hotel after five years. It's something we discussed and that's something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=17507)|
| 4:51:51| Commissioner Schoonmakers asked a lot of good questions about. And so as we dove into the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=17511)|
| 4:51:56| numbers, it took Phillip a while to get the numbers to Thad Wilson, the guy who does the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=17516)|
| 4:52:00| third-party report, and he was backed up a little bit. And I was trying to jam and get them to have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=17520)|
| 4:52:06| it to you, but it was going to get to you right at the last minute. And I know you guys want to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=17526)|
| 4:52:11| read this really carefully and have the time to look at it, and so that's why we asked for this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=17531)|
| 4:52:15| delay. But if you choose not to give the delay, Commissioner Schoonmakers is right, the agreement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=17535)|
| 4:52:20| would end by its terms. And that would save the developer, what, about $10,000? Yeah, the only| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=17540)|
| 4:52:30| reason I'm smiling is he's already paid it. But yes, he'd probably get some refund because they've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=17550)|
| 4:52:34| done some of the work. But yes, he'd save him some money. Okay. Well, and I guess there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=17554)|
| 4:52:43| a certain amount of commissioners that are very passionate about this particular project just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=17563)|
| 4:52:48| because we took a lot of grief from the community because we did move forward with the sale of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=17568)|
| 4:52:54| AJ building. But if this body wants to delay something till April, I'll call in line with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=17574)|
| 4:53:03| that as well, then. Thank you, sir. Thank you. Are there additional questions for item number 44?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=17583)|

| 4:53:42| Yes, sir. If not April, then what after April? Is there any other data that we'll be getting at that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=17622)|

| 4:53:57| that we'll have it to you for March. Chris and I talked about it. We just we thought April was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=17637)|
| 4:54:01| just extra safe. We're still I'm pushing them to have it to you for your March agenda. If we can't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=17641)|
| 4:54:08| have it done to you for April, then I think we need to all go home and be ashamed. So we definitely| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=17648)|
| 4:54:13| should have it to you by April. We're still hoping that we'll have it to you by March. And I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=17653)|
| 4:54:18| that again, I'm not I think these this whole project is a hard decision. Y'all had some great| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=17658)|
| 4:54:24| conversation. I do think even whether you're pro against the project, even if you decide later on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=17664)|
| 4:54:30| that you want to put it out for RFP again, I think you'll find this information really helpful to you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=17670)|
| 4:54:35| all in terms of whether you're going to even need to offer a pilot for this redevelopment. And so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=17675)|
| 4:54:41| given they've already paid the fee, and we're probably about 40% done with the report, I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=17681)|
| 4:54:46| that it could be some real helpful information to you guys to understand the economics of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=17686)|
| 4:54:51| AJ building and what it's going to cost to redevelop it and whether some type of incentive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=17691)|
| 4:54:56| is going to be needed at all. I mean, I don't think this will happen. But if they come back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=17696)|
| 4:55:00| and look at the numbers and say he doesn't need an incentive, I think we'll all be very happy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=17700)|
| 4:55:05| But I think that that I'll be very surprised if that's that's the result. But I think that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=17705)|
| 4:55:08| really helpful information for you guys, even if this one doesn't work out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=17708)|

| 5:02:38| the meeting was this past Saturday, but we have been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=18158)|
| 5:02:42| in contact with Legacy Parks. We have reached out to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=18162)|
| 5:02:46| We hope to work with them to preserve the green space that we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=18166)|
| 5:02:50| in our community. We also did some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=18170)|
| 5:02:54| digging and found that the last time the land| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=18174)|

| 5:03:18| and there were to be no grocery stores. Those restrictions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=18198)|
| 5:03:22| apply to any successor for the next 25 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=18202)|

| 5:03:50| will go before the MPC. We plan to show up there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=18230)|
| 5:03:54| We plan to make our voices heard, and we would like to request| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=18234)|
| 5:03:58| that the County Commission just give us some time to delay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=18238)|
| 5:04:02| and potentially purchase this land| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=18242)|
| 5:04:06| to create a park or preserve the green space that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=18246)|
| 5:04:10| have in our community. And again, thank you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=18250)|

| 5:04:46| comments to Mrs. Potts at all? I think that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=18286)|
| 5:04:50| to me, I think that until we have until this body has all the information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=18290)|
| 5:04:54| before it, with some information presented by both sides, and it's probably| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=18294)|
| 5:04:58| premature. Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=18298)|
| 5:05:02| Ms. Potts, I will say if you have any additional information you would like us to look at, you can always| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=18302)|

| 5:06:22| but the slogan is, if you can't talk, then text. So that should help out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=18382)|
| 5:06:26| a lot with trafficking and domestic assault, different kind of situation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=18386)|
