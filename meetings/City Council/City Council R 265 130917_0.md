| 0:15:59| Mayor Brown| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=959)|
| 0:16:01| Yes, Mayor, I wanted to thank the members of the Mechanicsville Homecoming Committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=961)|
| 0:16:05| for a very fine event on last Saturday along with the parade and everything turned out very well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=965)|
| 0:16:13| We had Vice Mayor Pavlis is there and I think Councilman Duane Greve also was there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=973)|
| 0:16:20| but they did a very good job and we had a very good event on last Saturday| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=980)|
| 0:16:25| in Mechanicsville at Danny Mayfield Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=985)|
| 0:16:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=988)|
| 0:16:31| Councilman Del Valle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=991)|
| 0:16:33| Thank you, Mayor. Just two brief things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=993)|
| 0:16:35| One is I want to thank all the folks that made the Happy Holopalooza event a success on Saturday| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=995)|
| 0:16:41| and we had police support and lots of folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=1001)|
| 0:16:44| The Falcons brought their band and people had a good time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=1004)|
| 0:16:48| It was a good place to have sort of community unity and getting to know folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=1008)|
| 0:16:54| and getting to know some of the businesses there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=1014)|
| 0:16:56| I've been asked to make an announcement that the Fountain City Lions Club,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=1016)|
| 0:17:00| which I should mention maintains the Fountain City Park and the Duck Pond area of the lake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=1020)|
| 0:17:06| They are hosting an annual spaghetti supper on October 17th from 4 to 7 p.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=1026)|
| 0:17:12| in the Lions Club building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=1032)|
| 0:17:15| Randy is out there with tickets if anyone wants to buy him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=1035)|
| 0:17:19| And they raise money to do that work to keep those parks up to snuff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=1039)|
| 0:17:24| and they're working with the city, I know, to improve the water quality at the lake| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=1044)|
| 0:17:28| with the rebuilding of the weir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=1048)|
| 0:17:31| Anyway, good folks, good program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=1051)|
| 0:17:34| If you're hungry, they got the food, October 17th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=1054)|
| 0:17:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=1057)|
| 0:17:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=1058)|
| 0:17:39| Councilman Graves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=1059)|
| 0:17:40| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=1060)|
| 0:17:41| I have three items that I'd like to bring up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=1061)|
| 0:17:43| But first of all, the first two items have to do with issues in the district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=1063)|
| 0:17:47| and I'd like to ask Mr. Swanson to give us an update on the shingles| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=1067)|
| 0:17:52| that are not only in West Knoxville but also in East Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=1072)|
| 0:17:55| I notice there's still a pile.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=1075)|
| 0:17:57| There is still a pile.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=1077)|
| 0:17:59| And we have checked recently on a number of occasions with regard to both sites.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=1079)|
| 0:18:05| On the west side over on Lexington Avenue, progress is being made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=1085)|
| 0:18:10| They are actually grinding the shingles down to a product that will then be used| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=1090)|
| 0:18:16| and recycling them into an asphalt that will be used in road building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=1096)|
| 0:18:23| And so they are being ground down there on the site for that purpose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=1103)|
| 0:18:29| I have been assured at both sites that all of the shingles will be gone by the end of this calendar year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=1109)|
| 0:18:39| and have been given personal assurances by owners of both sites that that is going to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=1119)|
| 0:18:44| Right now in the west site, they seem to be on schedule to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=1124)|
| 0:18:49| There has been a very significant reduction of the amount of shingles that have been ground down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=1129)|
| 0:18:54| that are being utilized for asphalt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=1134)|
| 0:18:59| We did have a little glitch or two with a little runoff that needed to be dealt with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=1139)|
| 0:19:03| And our engineering department got out there and did a great job of explaining to them what the rules were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=1143)|
| 0:19:09| with regard to runoff and tremendous improvement has been made in that regard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=1149)|
| 0:19:14| And that's still being monitored very carefully by the engineering department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=1154)|
| 0:19:18| If there's a problem with that, we will deal with it immediately rather than later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=1158)|
| 0:19:23| With regard to the other site, the news is not as good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=1163)|
| 0:19:26| We have been watching that site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=1166)|
| 0:19:28| And we were told initially that they did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=1168)|
| 0:19:32| We saw that they were making some progress over there fairly early in the year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=1172)|
| 0:19:37| And then it stopped.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=1177)|
| 0:19:38| And so I got in touch with them, and I was told that there was trucking issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=1178)|
| 0:19:43| that the construction season was such that they were having trouble with getting available trucking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=1183)|
| 0:19:49| but that it would get better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=1189)|
| 0:19:51| It has not gotten better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=1191)|
| 0:19:53| And I'm very concerned whether they're going to maintain schedule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=1193)|
| 0:19:56| I've been in touch with the lawyer for the owner on the east site within the last week| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=1196)|
| 0:20:02| and have asked him to talk to his client.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=1202)|
| 0:20:07| He has assured me that he's going to do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=1207)|
| 0:20:10| But we are prepared to take action on that site if they don't maintain their promises and keep on schedule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=1210)|
| 0:20:17| And right now it's not looking as promising in the east as it is in the west.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=1217)|
| 0:20:22| But you're on top of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=1222)|
| 0:20:24| We're following it closely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=1224)|
| 0:20:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=1225)|
| 0:20:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=1226)|
| 0:20:27| The other issue that is occurring in the second district is the retention pond at the corner of Dean Hill and Morrell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=1227)|
| 0:20:35| And I'm going to ask my colleague to give us a comment or an update on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=1235)|
| 0:20:39| I'm getting a number of phone calls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=1239)|
| 0:20:41| This has been going on for well over a year, I suppose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=1241)|
| 0:20:44| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=1244)|
| 0:20:45| But we'd like to just be given enough time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=1245)|
| 0:20:47| Thank you, Councilman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=1247)|
| 0:20:48| I appreciate you bringing that up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=1248)|
| 0:20:50| We've had a number of setbacks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=1250)|
| 0:20:52| We met with the engineering department this morning or, excuse me, this afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=1252)|
| 0:20:56| And suffice to say, record rainfalls, infrastructure problems, equipment limitations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=1256)|
| 0:21:03| and even beavers have been infiltrating that pond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=1263)|
| 0:21:07| And we've got a plan going forward and expect it to be done within the next 69 days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=1267)|
| 0:21:11| if we get approval with our alterations to the drain there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=1271)|
| 0:21:15| So it's been challenging.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=1275)|
| 0:21:16| I mean, there's a blue line stream that flows through that pond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=1276)|
| 0:21:19| And plenty of folks around here who have been there long enough know that the golf course used that as an irrigation pond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=1279)|
| 0:21:24| And it's just something you wouldn't see in today's environment trying to make these changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=1284)|
| 0:21:30| So hopefully we're all happy to get it done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=1290)|
| 0:21:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=1293)|
| 0:21:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=1294)|
| 0:21:35| You'll keep us updated, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=1295)|
| 0:21:36| Sure, especially when you ask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=1296)|
| 0:21:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=1299)|
| 0:21:41| And, Mayor, the other thing I think that we have kind of an unusual situation here this evening| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=1301)|
| 0:21:45| concerning one of our ordinances on first reading, which is 12B.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=1305)|
| 0:21:49| And I understand that we've had a number of folks sign up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=1309)|
| 0:21:52| And normally it's our policy that you have three people speak on one side| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=1312)|
| 0:21:57| and three people speak on the other side, five minutes each.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=1317)|
| 0:22:00| And so I know that we've kind of had a discussion on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=1320)|
| 0:22:03| we would like to give that opportunity for everyone who has signed up to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=1323)|
| 0:22:08| I'm not sure what the numbers are right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=1328)|
| 0:22:10| but if maybe possibly we could let them decide who wants the five-minute slots| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=1330)|
| 0:22:16| and then the remainder two minutes each on that, if that's agreeable to council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=1336)|
| 0:22:22| That way we will give all those who have signed up an opportunity to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=1342)|
| 0:22:25| How many do we have?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=1345)|
| 0:22:26| We have seven signed up against 12B and five for 12B to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=1346)|
| 0:22:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=1352)|
| 0:22:33| So what we'll do, I guess when we get to that point on the agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=1353)|
| 0:22:37| we'll make a motion to suspend the rules| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=1357)|
| 0:22:40| and allow more than the typical three people five minutes each to speak,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=1360)|
| 0:22:46| allowing the additional ones, it would be four additional ones against| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=1366)|
| 0:22:53| and two additional speakers, four, to speak for the two minutes each.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=1373)|
| 0:22:58| But what I'd ask, I'll list these names.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=1378)|
| 0:23:00| I ask for each of the sides, if you want to get together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=1380)|
| 0:23:04| and decide who's going to be the five-minute speakers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=1384)|
| 0:23:07| and who are going to be the two-minute speakers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=1387)|
| 0:23:10| because you'll have to organize yourself or else I'll just go down the list| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=1390)|
| 0:23:13| and the first three on each side would be the five minutes, I guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=1393)|
| 0:23:18| unless you organize yourself differently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=1398)|
| 0:23:22| If I can interrupt, I think also that everyone needs to understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=1402)|
| 0:23:25| that we've had a workshop,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=1405)|
| 0:23:27| and I'm sure that all of us have spent a great deal of time not only on the telephones| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=1407)|
| 0:23:30| but emails and postcards and letters,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=1410)|
| 0:23:33| and so we're not necessarily saying that everyone has to take five minutes or two minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=1413)|
| 0:23:38| If they can get up and tell us something new and different in a less amount of time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=1418)|
| 0:23:41| that would certainly be appreciated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=1421)|
| 0:23:43| It's always up to that amount of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=1423)|
| 0:23:45| So I'm going to read the names of those who signed up against,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=1425)|
| 0:23:49| and if you want to get up and meet right outside, right there, meet right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=1429)|

| 0:24:23| Those are all the names that I have on this list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=1463)|
| 0:24:26| Make sure that's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=1466)|
| 0:24:28| If you would please figure out who's going to be the three speakers who have up to five minutes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=1468)|
| 0:24:33| and the rest will get up to two minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=1473)|
| 0:24:36| And then those four, the rezoning, Paul Baker, Ruben Pilo, John King, Melanie Robinson, and Condon Radford.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=1476)|
| 0:24:47| If you will please decide that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=1487)|
| 0:24:49| And when we get to it, after we suspend the rules to allow this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=1489)|
| 0:24:52| then each side can let us know how you want to proceed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=1492)|

| 0:41:35| We're here tonight to seek your approval for O-1 zoning for our proposed site on Middlebrook Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=2495)|
| 0:41:41| This comes to you with unanimous approval for the O-1 zoning from the Metropolitan Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=2501)|
| 0:41:47| As you know, during the city council workshop that was held on August 29th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=2507)|
| 0:41:51| we shared the business case for the project as well as the steps that we've taken to date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=2511)|
| 0:41:56| We shared how healthcare is changing and how we must prepare to meet the demands of the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=2516)|
| 0:42:03| Two of our key physician leaders, Drs. Brabson and Berline,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=2523)|
| 0:42:06| shared that the medical staff that's actively involved in the life of the hospital| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=2526)|
| 0:42:10| is fully and strongly supportive of this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=2530)|
| 0:42:13| We provided you with letters of support from many physicians at that time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=2533)|
| 0:42:17| which we've delivered to the city recorder for inclusion in tonight's record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=2537)|
| 0:42:21| As we also outlined during the workshop, we have met with neighborhood groups and individuals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=2541)|
| 0:42:26| both from West Knoxville and North Knoxville, consistently over the past six months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=2546)|
| 0:42:31| We've listened. We've talked. We've had dialogue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=2551)|
| 0:42:34| We've made numerous modifications to the proposed plan for the hospital facility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=2554)|
| 0:42:38| including positioning the hospital, emergency department, and medical office building on the site| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=2558)|
| 0:42:43| in such a way as to maximize the distance between the facility and the closest residences.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=2563)|
| 0:42:49| We explained that we're not asking to rezone the 44 acres to the south of the creek| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=2569)|
| 0:42:53| in order to keep that portion of the property protected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=2573)|
| 0:42:57| We also explained our commitment to North Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=2577)|
| 0:43:00| which we've demonstrated through our substantial investment in building a hospital off of Emory Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=2580)|
| 0:43:05| as well as the plans that are currently underway for the services that will remain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=2585)|
| 0:43:09| at the existing Physicians Regional Medical Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=2589)|
| 0:43:12| The city of Knoxville has previously determined that the subject property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=2592)|
| 0:43:16| should be properly utilized for office purposes, as shown in the one-year and sector plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=2596)|
| 0:43:22| After several meetings with the Metropolitan Planning Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=2602)|
| 0:43:25| it was determined that we should seek the O1 medical office and related uses zone for this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=2605)|
| 0:43:32| MPC undertook the review of our request,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=2612)|
| 0:43:35| and the commission unanimously voted to approve the O1 zoning for this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=2615)|
| 0:43:39| It should be noted that this request and this development blends with the existing medical node,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=2619)|
| 0:43:45| as evidenced by the Dowell Springs development across Middlebrook Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=2625)|
| 0:43:49| We ask that you confirm and approve the determination of MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=2629)|
| 0:43:54| We ask that a decision be made tonight so that our due diligence process may continue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=2634)|
| 0:43:59| That due diligence process includes applying for a certificate of need with the state,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=2639)|
| 0:44:04| as well as finalizing our plans for the existing hospital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=2644)|
| 0:44:08| The rezoning approval is needed in order for us to continue through the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=2648)|
| 0:44:13| We'd like to reserve any additional time that remains to respond to questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=2653)|
| 0:44:17| and points which may be raised by others speaking after us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=2657)|
| 0:44:20| We thank you for your consideration, and we certainly ask for your approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=2660)|
| 0:44:25| Thank you, Ms. Robinson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=2665)|
| 0:44:28| Next, we have Condon Radford.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=2668)|
| 0:44:42| And after Mr. Radford will be Paul Baker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=2682)|
| 0:44:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=2691)|
| 0:44:54| My name is Condon Radford.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=2694)|
| 0:44:56| I live at 6514 Beaver Ridge Road, Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=2696)|
| 0:45:01| I am the director of engineering at Physician Regional Medical Center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=2701)|
| 0:45:06| and I've been employed there for 47 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=2706)|
| 0:45:09| And the only thing I'd like to say is this is an 83-year-old facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=2709)|
| 0:45:16| The infrastructure is really not suited for today's needs for patient care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=2716)|
| 0:45:23| We have really worked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=2723)|
| 0:45:24| We work around the clock, sometimes seven days a week, to fix equipment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=2724)|
| 0:45:29| Our boiler was actually put in in 1954.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=2729)|
| 0:45:34| And everyone up here, you know, I've heard some interesting things here tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=2734)|
| 0:45:38| about roofs, windows, houses, and things, and that's exactly what we face.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=2738)|
| 0:45:44| And I've worked all night long before on our handlers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=2744)|
| 0:45:50| and getting machinists to make things to keep this facility going for patient care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=2750)|
| 0:45:55| And that's our focus is patient care and taking care of life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=2755)|
| 0:45:59| So today, you know, we don't have enough room from slab to slab| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=2759)|
| 0:46:07| to update our facilities to meet today's codes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=2767)|
| 0:46:11| They change every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=2771)|
| 0:46:12| You know, everybody up here sees that changing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=2772)|
| 0:46:15| And we got to do with all kinds of codes and regulations and things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=2775)|
| 0:46:21| So I'd just like to ask, please consider this approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=2781)|
| 0:46:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=2785)|
| 0:46:26| Thank you, Mr. Radford.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=2786)|
| 0:46:32| Mr. Paul Baker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=2792)|
| 0:46:41| My name is Paul Baker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=2801)|
| 0:46:42| I live at 1921 Lyons Bend Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=2802)|
| 0:46:48| I'm a physician at St. Mary's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=2808)|
| 0:46:49| I've practiced medicine there for the past 30 years at St. Mary's Tenova.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=2809)|
| 0:46:54| I'm not employed by the hospital and have not been asked by them to appear here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=2814)|
| 0:46:58| I come here primarily as a citizen of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=2818)|
| 0:47:02| I wish to address the issue of rezoning a Middlebrook Pike property to allow Tenova| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=2822)|
| 0:47:06| to build a new hospital at that location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=2826)|
| 0:47:09| I understand and respect the opinion of those in opposition to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=2829)|
| 0:47:14| However, I believe that the elected body here must do what's in the best interest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=2834)|
| 0:47:19| of the community as a whole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=2839)|
| 0:47:22| Tenova has six hospitals in this region.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=2842)|
| 0:47:25| Three of these are in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=2845)|
| 0:47:27| The downtown hospital, Physicians Regional Medical Center, is the largest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=2847)|
| 0:47:33| It has aged to the point where it can't continue as it is because of needing so much| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=2853)|
| 0:47:38| renovation and upgrading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=2858)|
| 0:47:41| Tenova's proposal to relocate that hospital to Middlebrook Pike seems logical.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=2861)|
| 0:47:46| Many doctor's offices are there already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=2866)|
| 0:47:48| It's centrally located.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=2868)|
| 0:47:50| It will be built to accommodate current health care needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=2870)|
| 0:47:55| There will be increased needs in the health care as the new health care law takes effect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=2875)|
| 0:48:00| and the population ages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=2880)|
| 0:48:02| It seems unwise to block a Tenova plan to meet that need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=2882)|
| 0:48:07| To expect Tenova to patch up the downtown hospital and continue there seems to me short-sighted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=2887)|
| 0:48:15| Something will be built on that location on Middlebrook Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=2895)|
| 0:48:18| Something will be built.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=2898)|
| 0:48:20| It will not be a park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=2900)|
| 0:48:23| A hospital can be a community-friendly enterprise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=2903)|
| 0:48:27| Knoxville needs a new hospital like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=2907)|
| 0:48:30| It needs a hospital system that can be a strong business model.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=2910)|
| 0:48:34| If a hospital can't thrive economically, it won't survive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=2914)|
| 0:48:38| And we have seen this most recently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=2918)|
| 0:48:42| I believe the city as a whole supports this new hospital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=2922)|
| 0:48:45| A new hospital in Middlebrook Pike location would be a great asset to the city and the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=2925)|
| 0:48:50| I recall several years ago that the State Department of Transportation wanted to build a bypass| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=2930)|
| 0:48:56| from Interstate 75 north on Raccoon Valley area to Watt Road on the west.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=2936)|
| 0:49:03| After some objection, the plans were shelved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=2943)|
| 0:49:06| No doubt those people objecting had their reasons, but was it wise?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=2946)|
| 0:49:11| I often think of that decision as I drive the congested I-40-75 daily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=2951)|
| 0:49:18| The members of this council owe the citizens of Knoxville primarily their judgment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=2958)|
| 0:49:24| I hope that they will vote to approve this new hospital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=2964)|
| 0:49:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=2967)|
| 0:49:28| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=2968)|

| 0:49:55| Sorry, I was told I was going to follow up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=2995)|
| 0:49:57| Okay, that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=2997)|
| 0:49:58| Physician after physician.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=2998)|

| 0:50:17| I guess we came about the same time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=3017)|
| 0:50:22| I have served as the Chairman of the Department of Radiology for 20-plus years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=3022)|

| 0:50:30| and the Medical Executive Committee for 20-plus years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=3030)|
| 0:50:35| So I say all that because I do represent the medical staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=3035)|
| 0:50:41| I think I understand what their needs are and what their desires are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=3041)|
| 0:50:46| and I can tell you we've been through the process of looking at options,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=3046)|
| 0:50:50| knowing that St. Mary's was getting older| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=3050)|
| 0:50:53| and that it was going to need updating or replacement or whatever for years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=3053)|
| 0:50:58| There was a plan in place to update it when it was St. Mary's,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=3058)|
| 0:51:04| and we looked at that and decided that wasn't a good move to make,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=3064)|
| 0:51:08| and we decided to go north and we decided to merge with Baptist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=3068)|
| 0:51:12| So all that being said, the medical staff, I want to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=3072)|
| 0:51:16| is solidly behind this relocation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=3076)|
| 0:51:20| We think it's a great choice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=3080)|
| 0:51:22| We think it will work well for our medical staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=3082)|
| 0:51:25| Medical staff has held well together through the years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=3085)|
| 0:51:28| We've got a great medical staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=3088)|
| 0:51:30| I don't think we can keep it together in our current location because it's not serving our patients.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=3090)|
| 0:51:35| It's just not serving our patients the way it needs to anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=3095)|
| 0:51:39| We're too spread out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=3099)|
| 0:51:41| Our department is spread out all over the map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=3101)|
| 0:51:45| I hope you approve this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=3105)|
| 0:51:46| This will be a good move for the community and our patients.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=3106)|
| 0:51:50| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=3110)|
| 0:51:51| Thank you, Dr. Simmons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=3111)|
| 0:51:52| Now, Mr. Pelow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=3112)|
| 0:52:00| I'm Reuben Pelow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=3120)|
| 0:52:02| Dr. Pelow, sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=3122)|
| 0:52:03| That's perfectly all right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=3123)|
| 0:52:05| And I live in West Hills, 8437 Cortland Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=3125)|
| 0:52:10| And I've just come before you for a few minutes to say that I feel that the project that Tenova has proposed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=3130)|
| 0:52:17| is a very friendly, community-friendly project that is going on, and I do approve of this program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=3137)|
| 0:52:26| I am speaking solely for myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=3146)|
| 0:52:28| I am not speaking for the community association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=3148)|
| 0:52:31| Our community has been somewhat divided over this, so I don't think it's a major split.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=3151)|
| 0:52:37| But the West Hills Community Association has approximately 1,300 households within its borders,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=3157)|
| 0:52:47| and those borders were defined by this council back in 1973, and we've stayed with that all this period of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=3167)|
| 0:52:54| Now, the arguments that have been presented by the opposition have been very vocal and very loud,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=3174)|
| 0:53:01| but they are not anywhere near that kind of number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=3181)|
| 0:53:04| So I can't say that the community of West Hills supports or denies or disapproves of the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=3184)|
| 0:53:13| We have not had a meeting on that, and we do not intend to do that before this thing has to be decided.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=3193)|
| 0:53:20| As far as the issues that the Tenova people have proposed, I am not convinced that we have a major issue there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=3200)|
| 0:53:32| On to the traffic issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=3212)|
| 0:53:34| You have 30 seconds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=3214)|
| 0:53:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=3215)|
| 0:53:36| But, well, the need for a hospital has been addressed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=3216)|
| 0:53:39| and I think that one of the things that we have to remember is that hospitals are different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=3219)|
| 0:53:45| Some are like UTS trauma, like children's place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=3225)|
| 0:53:51| Not every hospital is the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=3231)|
| 0:53:53| So the certificate for need will have to be decided by the people in Nashville and not for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=3233)|
| 0:53:59| But I do hope you will support this provision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=3239)|
| 0:54:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=3242)|
| 0:54:03| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=3243)|
| 0:54:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=3244)|
| 0:54:09| Now we move on to the 70 people who signed up against the rezoning, starting with Mr. Swingle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=3249)|
| 0:54:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=3263)|
| 0:54:24| Before I start, I just want to note that I gave the petition to, I think, Ms. Mitchell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=3264)|
| 0:54:32| These are the signatures that we had gathered, 699 signatures in opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=3272)|
| 0:54:36| I just made one copy, so Council has that copy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=3276)|
| 0:54:41| My name is Rocky Swingle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=3281)|
| 0:54:43| I live at 7213 Sheffield Drive in Knoxville, and my remarks are in opposition to rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=3283)|
| 0:54:51| There are quite a number of people here in support of what I'm going to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=3291)|
| 0:54:54| and I would ask them all to stand up now and be recognized, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=3294)|
| 0:55:01| Great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=3301)|
| 0:55:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=3302)|
| 0:55:05| When Tenova predecessor Mercy Health presented its case to the Health Services and Development Agency, or HSDA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=3305)|
| 0:55:13| in order to get a certificate of need to build their St. Mary's North facility on Emory Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=3313)|
| 0:55:19| and then later to expand it, they made the following arguments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=3319)|
| 0:55:22| which apparently were good arguments because the CONs were granted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=3322)|
| 0:55:27| The plan was to decompress the main campus and move major functions north.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=3327)|
| 0:55:33| Mercy said the cost to renovate St. Mary's, $50 million to $60 million,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=3333)|
| 0:55:37| was about the same as the cost to build a new hospital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=3337)|
| 0:55:41| Triple that for inflation, this was several years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=3341)|
| 0:55:44| and it's still less than the $250 million to $300 million price tag for the proposed hospital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=3344)|
| 0:55:50| Tenova now says it's too expensive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=3350)|
| 0:55:53| Mercy said the move was justified because population to the north was growing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=3353)|
| 0:55:58| Less Knoxville doesn't have any more room to grow,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=3358)|
| 0:56:01| and expanding population isn't a valid justification for a new hospital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=3361)|
| 0:56:06| Mercy wrote that there were many poor and underserved people in the northern area who needed a hospital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=3366)|
| 0:56:13| Tenova is abandoning poor and underserved people to get into a more lucrative West Knoxville market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=3373)|
| 0:56:19| For example, of the 51,000 emergency room visits last year at St. Mary's,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=3379)|
| 0:56:25| 71% were classified as self-pay or TennCare Medicaid, poor people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=3385)|
| 0:56:31| The rest had commercial insurance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=3391)|
| 0:56:33| While at Park West, just a few miles down the road from the Middlebrook site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=3393)|
| 0:56:37| only 28% were classified as self-pay or TennCare Medicaid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=3397)|
| 0:56:41| Better insured people represent more profit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=3401)|
| 0:56:45| The plan specifically, Mercy plan specifically said they did not want to move west| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=3405)|
| 0:56:51| because the West Knoxville hospital market was, quote, overcrowded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=3411)|
| 0:56:57| No hospital has left West Knoxville since then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=3417)|
| 0:57:00| It's still an overcrowded market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=3420)|
| 0:57:02| Mercy said they would build a new hospital near downtown to serve the areas that were served by Baptist and St. Mary's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=3422)|
| 0:57:09| They said the best place to do that was the site of Baptist Hospital,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=3429)|
| 0:57:13| and they needed to close Baptist in order to build a new facility there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=3433)|
| 0:57:17| They closed Baptist, and now they want to move to Middlebrook Pike, which is not near downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=3437)|
| 0:57:22| It's near Westtown, but it's not near downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=3442)|
| 0:57:25| Mercy was concerned about travel difficulties of the elderly and disadvantaged from outlying regions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=3445)|
| 0:57:30| They said the new plan was consistent with St. Mary's mission of improving health care of people who were poor and underserved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=3450)|
| 0:57:37| Now they're leaving those people behind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=3457)|
| 0:57:40| The St. Mary's ER that saw 51,000 ER visits in 2012 is being closed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=3460)|
| 0:57:45| That's 18% of all ER visits in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=3465)|
| 0:57:48| Only UT, the regional trauma center, had more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=3468)|
| 0:57:51| The CON said they were moving into a market without a hospital| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=3471)|
| 0:57:54| so there would be no negative impact on competitors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=3474)|
| 0:57:57| Now they're moving into a well-served area, hoping to gain a share of a more lucrative market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=3477)|
| 0:58:02| The CON application contained a site map of the current St. Mary's that showed the age of buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=3482)|
| 0:58:07| Six of the 11 buildings were built in the 70s, 80s, and 90s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=3487)|
| 0:58:11| The North facility was designed for expansion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=3491)|
| 0:58:14| including an expanded ER intensive care radiology and a new three-story wing of the building for inpatient care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=3494)|
| 0:58:21| Also, the plan was to do it, the expansion, in a way to minimize operational and system disruptions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=3501)|
| 0:58:28| and to preclude facility disruption and shutdowns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=3508)|
| 0:58:32| Now they say to NOVA that expansion would be too disruptive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=3512)|
| 0:58:36| Sir, you have one minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=3516)|
| 0:58:38| So NOVA should expand the North campus and put money into St. Mary's to keep it open as a full-service hospital,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=3518)|
| 0:58:43| just as their long-term development plan stated, all for the cost of building a new hospital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=3523)|
| 0:58:49| Rezoning this property is about the future of health care for our city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=3529)|
| 0:58:54| It's about placing a hospital where it's not needed and taking away a hospital where one is needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=3534)|
| 0:59:00| Rezoning by itself will not close the door of St. Mary's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=3540)|
| 0:59:04| But if you grant to NOVA's request, your hand will be on the door, along with others, pushing it shut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=3544)|
| 0:59:13| What you should do is push from the other side to keep that door open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=3553)|
| 0:59:18| A vote against rezoning will help that effort, and that's what I urge you to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=3558)|
| 0:59:23| Finally, this is a vote that will never be forgotten.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=3563)|
| 0:59:29| I hope that it will be remembered as a vote for the people, for common sense, for decency, and for good health care planning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=3569)|

| 0:59:52| I thank the City Council for allowing us to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=3592)|
| 0:59:55| This is when democracy works, when we're heard, and thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=3595)|
| 0:59:58| I would like to share thoughts not only as a resident of Oakwood and North Knoxville, but for all the neighborhoods,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=3598)|
| 1:00:03| the central neighborhoods of Knoxville as well as this region.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=3603)|
| 1:00:08| We need your address, sir. I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=3608)|
| 1:00:10| I'm Dana Fox from 2115 Page Street, Knoxville. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=3610)|
| 1:00:15| The question tonight is not whether Physicians Regional, the former St. Mary's, will be renewed for the 21st century, but where it will be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=3615)|
| 1:00:22| Physicians St. Mary's has a great history for caring for the community, and that mission could be jeopardized,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=3622)|
| 1:00:27| not because it's unsustainable where it is, but because current management sees greener grass in the short run.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=3627)|
| 1:00:33| To any group of physicians who care about Knoxville, I would say, first, do no harm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=3633)|
| 1:00:39| The elimination of a primary hospital in the central city will greatly damage the core downtown neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=3639)|
| 1:00:45| SANOVA representative Melanie Robinson stated that the new site was partially selected because of its central location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=3645)|
| 1:00:51| The unspoken assertion is that the present location is not central to the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=3651)|
| 1:00:55| In fact, a great deal of money has been spent in recent years to replace the interchange at I-275 in Woodland,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=3655)|
| 1:01:01| as well as widening I-40 and replacing the interchange at Broadway and Hall of Fame.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=3661)|
| 1:01:06| Both provide easy, fast access from I-75, I-40, and the entire region to the current hospital location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=3666)|
| 1:01:13| Melanie Robinson also stated that you don't build a building for 10 years, you build a building for 50 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=3673)|
| 1:01:19| Looking at the next 50 years, regardless of what entity owns the hospital, the core mission, as Mr. Jerry Askew stated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=3679)|
| 1:01:28| is, quote, to bring value to the community we serve, unquote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=3688)|
| 1:01:31| At an early neighborhood meeting this past March, Mr. Askew was asked if the Oak Hill north side site was leveled| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=3691)|
| 1:01:38| and ready for fresh development, would SANOVA build there or would they build west?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=3698)|
| 1:01:43| His answer was west Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=3703)|
| 1:01:45| This request for rezoning is not because it's impossible to renovate or rebuild on the 20 acres between Woodland and Oak Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=3705)|
| 1:01:52| This request for zoning is to speed a move to west Knoxville when no new need has yet been established.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=3712)|
| 1:01:59| Unlike encouraging other businesses to come and grow in Knoxville, this zoning request ignores the fact that no new net jobs would be created.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=3719)|
| 1:02:08| Architects can create plans for existing hilly sites.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=3728)|
| 1:02:12| They do it all the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=3732)|
| 1:02:14| If approved, the Middlebrook Hospital would be put in a neighborhood where it is not wanted and removed from one where it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=3734)|
| 1:02:20| The only hospital north of I-40 and within the I-640 downtown core would be largely eliminated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=3740)|
| 1:02:27| No concrete plan for what will be put in its place directly adjacent to Knoxville Fulton High School and the north Knoxville neighborhoods is ready.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=3747)|
| 1:02:38| The city has made great strides in redeveloping downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=3758)|
| 1:02:41| Tentative but encouraging redevelopment north of I-40 along Broadway and Central would be jeopardized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=3761)|
| 1:02:46| This would set back these neighborhoods perhaps for decades.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=3766)|
| 1:02:49| On the other hand, new renovation on the 20 acres available at the existing site, including plenty of existing surface lots,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=3769)|
| 1:02:57| where new structures could be built as tall as needed, beginning with parking garages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=3777)|
| 1:03:03| Redevelopment there would encourage more physicians' offices and other businesses to the area without losing those that are in the area now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=3783)|
| 1:03:09| Where there's a will, there is a way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=3789)|
| 1:03:11| If Tenova or community health management or any other entity operated, a group of physicians want to move to make the Oak Hill site a great hospital, it can be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=3791)|
| 1:03:23| The trend of great cities is renewal of both residential and businesses in the urban core.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=3803)|
| 1:03:28| Dying cities act like we're in the middle of the 20th century when zoning encouraged the flight out of the central city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=3808)|
| 1:03:35| New communities for the 21st century are renovating their downtowns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=3815)|
| 1:03:40| The best of all possible outcomes is still possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=3820)|
| 1:03:43| Once a signal has been given that physicians will rebuild on its existing site, businesses and physicians' offices will be encouraged there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=3823)|
| 1:03:50| The Middlebrook location is the third spec hospital after Powell and Turkey Creek that may also fail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=3830)|
| 1:03:55| I'm sure you have one minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=3835)|
| 1:03:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=3837)|
| 1:03:58| The vast majority of Knoxville residents don't know that the complex of buildings towering over Broadway and over North Knox are slated to be emptied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=3838)|
| 1:04:07| Please vote in the best interests of the patients and the community, and thank you for letting us be heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=3847)|

| 1:04:32| My remarks are based on the address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=3872)|
| 1:04:34| I'm sorry, 811 Gratz.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=3874)|
| 1:04:37| And my remarks are based on my impressions of the issue and were approved by the board of directors of Fourth and Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=3877)|
| 1:04:45| Like my neighbors in greater North Knoxville and my fellow citizens in East and West Knoxville, I'm alarmed at the actions of Tenova.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=3885)|
| 1:04:54| I'm incensed that citizens of West Knoxville may, against their considered objections, see their areas so negatively changed by this corporation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=3894)|
| 1:05:04| The desired actions of this corporation will surely cause collapse in North Knoxville of business activity that's generated in and around Old St. Mary's Hospital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=3904)|
| 1:05:16| With all the effort that you and my fellow citizens have put forth to protect and develop North Broadway, the North Broadway corridor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=3916)|
| 1:05:25| I realize you know full well what the deterioration of business around Old St. Mary's is likely to do to the entire corridor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=3925)|
| 1:05:35| Knoxville city government and you, our elected representatives, have worked in exemplary fashion with citizens in greater Knoxville area to develop our city for our collective future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=3935)|
| 1:05:46| In the North Knoxville area, you have done this by supporting facade improvement, civic engagement, public transportation, bikeways, walkable neighborhoods, and small businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=3946)|
| 1:05:59| In the last 20 years, these efforts have brought lavish praise to Knoxville from visitors who come from all over the USA and beyond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=3959)|
| 1:06:11| I have seen Tenova's PowerPoint presentations and heard its public relations representatives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=3971)|
| 1:06:19| This medical corporation has no interest in the development of our city, its residents, or its neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=3979)|
| 1:06:27| I recognize the power of corporations and that their aim is shareholder profit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=3987)|
| 1:06:34| I realize it's not personal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=3994)|
| 1:06:37| It's the business of corporations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=3997)|
| 1:06:41| This is the third meeting I have attended regarding the recent maneuvers of the corporation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=4001)|
| 1:06:48| Thus far, I have not encountered one independent citizen who favors its actions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=4008)|
| 1:06:54| There have been paid representatives of the corporation who favor the move.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=4014)|
| 1:06:59| There have been medical professionals who are on the payroll of the corporation who favor it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=4019)|
| 1:07:05| However, dozens, perhaps hundreds, of independent citizens from West Knoxville, North Knoxville, and East Knoxville have expressed their opposition to the corporation's intentions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=4025)|
| 1:07:19| I've had the privilege of talking to you individually, to most of you, on council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=4039)|
| 1:07:25| I've been fortunate to work with fellow citizens from all over Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=4045)|
| 1:07:29| I know how much you individual people sacrifice for our community, citizens and representatives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=4049)|
| 1:07:38| You steal time from your home lives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=4058)|

| 1:07:43| You pay for parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=4063)|
| 1:07:44| You attend interminable meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=4064)|

| 1:07:55| Collectively, our interests for Knoxville's future are here and remain here, not in a corporate board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=4075)|
| 1:08:05| In any business deal, there should be a balance of good for the parties involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=4085)|
| 1:08:11| It should be a win-win.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=4091)|
| 1:08:13| This deal is a win-lose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=4093)|
| 1:08:17| If it passes, it's a win for the corporation and a loss for the citizens of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=4097)|
| 1:08:23| Let the corporation prove itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=4103)|
| 1:08:26| Let it prove to the state the need for this action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=4106)|

| 1:09:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=4160)|
| 1:09:21| I'm here to speak against the rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=4161)|
| 1:09:23| My reasoning is that Tenova is owned by Health Management Associates, which is $3.7 billion in debt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=4163)|
| 1:09:31| They've been laying off employees, cutting benefits, freezing vacation time accruals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=4171)|
| 1:09:36| and now they want to close St. Mary's or Physicians Regional.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=4176)|
| 1:09:41| They've just fired their board for returning a less than 1% profit to their investors over the last ten years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=4181)|
| 1:09:50| and that's according to the Wall Street Journal's Market Watch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=4190)|
| 1:09:54| Community Health Systems has offered to pay $7.6 billion to HMA to purchase the system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=4194)|
| 1:10:04| which will then make CHS the largest for-profit organization, medical organization, in the United States.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=4204)|
| 1:10:13| I don't think that's a good reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=4213)|
| 1:10:15| That's according to the Tennessean, and I don't think that's a good reason for us rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=4215)|
| 1:10:20| The point here is the current hospital owner is going to sell to someone else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=4220)|
| 1:10:27| My question is, why would we rezone while all of that's still murky and not finalized?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=4227)|
| 1:10:34| It's not supposed to be finalized until the end of the first quarter, 2014.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=4234)|
| 1:10:39| The CSH's stated strategic business plan, and I quote from Knox Views,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=4239)|
| 1:10:46| is to target markets with a history of being medically underserved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=4246)|
| 1:10:51| You have 30 seconds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=4251)|
| 1:10:53| I don't believe Knoxville is medically underserved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=4253)|
| 1:10:56| Once it's rezoned, it can be sold again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=4256)|
| 1:11:00| My question is, what will they build, a hospital or something that we can't even imagine at this time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=4260)|
| 1:11:07| Trust me, we will remember who voted which way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=4267)|

| 1:11:30| Thank you, Mayor and Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=4290)|
| 1:11:32| My name is Robin Zolkin Brown, and my address is 8033 Hayden Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=4292)|
| 1:11:40| I'm not exactly part of the West Hills subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=4300)|
| 1:11:43| I'm in what they call West Hills South, and I back up to the target.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=4303)|
| 1:11:48| I did address you previously at the workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=4308)|
| 1:11:52| While I live in West Knoxville, I worked at 901 North Broadway for 39 years for a place called KCDC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=4312)|
| 1:12:01| and I managed two of the three high-rises that are within two miles of St. Mary's Hospital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=4321)|
| 1:12:10| My residents need a hospital close by.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=4330)|
| 1:12:13| I can't tell you how many times I went to pick somebody up to bring them home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=4333)|
| 1:12:19| They need that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=4339)|
| 1:12:21| If you relocate this hospital, you take that type of health care away from the center city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=4341)|
| 1:12:28| and from the east part of town, to say nothing of the surrounding counties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=4348)|
| 1:12:34| If I had been blessed to have a child to play football for Fulton, what I've wanted, and he got hurt,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=4354)|
| 1:12:40| but I've wanted to go around the corner or ten miles down the street for him to get fixed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=4360)|
| 1:12:47| So I request for you tonight, please veto this voting request, and if you do, let's look at putting something east,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=4367)|
| 1:12:56| and I'll be glad to help you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=4376)|
| 1:12:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=4378)|

| 1:13:16| Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=4396)|
| 1:13:17| I'm Charlotte Davis, 104 Crawford Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=4397)|
| 1:13:21| I'm a two-minute person, so I'm going to read fast, but I hope you listen closely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=4401)|
| 1:13:27| I shared with you at the council workshop on the 29th a few of my thoughts regarding the proposed zoning change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=4407)|
| 1:13:34| that will ultimately permit the construction of another hospital in West Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=4414)|
| 1:13:39| followed by diminished services or even the eventual closure of St. Mary's,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=4419)|
| 1:13:46| leaving only to Nova at Powell, not even a full-service hospital,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=4426)|
| 1:13:51| to serve the residents of north and east Knoxville City and County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=4431)|
| 1:13:57| and the many people who come to Knoxville for hospital services from many counties to our north and northeast.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=4437)|
| 1:14:05| At the workshop, it was pointed out to you that the closure of St. Mary's will also negatively affect the hospital| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=4445)|
| 1:14:13| and emergency care of the residents, as has already been mentioned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=4453)|
| 1:14:18| of three large senior living facilities that are less than one quarter to two miles from St. Mary's,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=4458)|
| 1:14:26| and this is not counting the nursing home at Beverly or two nursing homes in the immediate vicinity of St. Mary's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=4466)|
| 1:14:35| With much less the cost of building a new hospital, the needed physical changes could be made at St. Mary's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=4475)|
| 1:14:44| I was there when the tower, the physician's building and the central wing were constructed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=4484)|
| 1:14:50| You have 30 seconds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=4490)|
| 1:14:51| And the care of our patients did not suffer and went on as usual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=4491)|
| 1:14:56| Good management is the secret.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=4496)|
| 1:14:59| And who is to say that there will be better management of a new hospital| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=4499)|
| 1:15:04| than has occurred in the management in the last few years of the medical facilities owned by Tenova?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=4504)|
| 1:15:12| Of course physicians support a new hospital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=4512)|
| 1:15:16| Most physicians live west, and it would be much more convenient for them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=4516)|
| 1:15:23| and it doesn't matter the inconvenience that it would be for those who live north and east.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=4523)|
| 1:15:28| Mr. Davis, your time is up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=4528)|
| 1:15:29| All right. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=4529)|
| 1:15:30| Thank you, Ms. Davis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=4530)|

| 1:15:40| Is that Reverend Butler?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=4540)|
| 1:15:42| Reverend John Butler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=4542)|

| 1:15:48| John Butler, 4111 Landon Drive, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37921.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=4548)|
| 1:15:55| I come representing Kikma, Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=4555)|
| 1:15:58| and to the nomination of Christian Ministerial Alliance, of which I'm the president.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=4558)|
| 1:16:03| And also I'm the president of the Knoxville branch of the NAACP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=4563)|
| 1:16:08| And when I first called to get on the agenda to have remarks, I was asked was I for or against,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=4568)|
| 1:16:15| and my honest answer was I'm not sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=4575)|
| 1:16:19| I did not come to say for or against will tell you how to vote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=4579)|
| 1:16:23| but I did come to share some concerns that we have in our organizations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=4583)|
| 1:16:28| and that is how a move would affect this community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=4588)|
| 1:16:32| We've seen so many community stakeholders like hospitals and businesses and et cetera| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=4592)|
| 1:16:39| that are moving from the east, from the northeast, and from the south.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=4599)|
| 1:16:45| It is negatively affecting our communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=4605)|
| 1:16:48| We've heard a number of that tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=4608)|
| 1:16:52| So our concern is not only about health care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=4612)|
| 1:16:55| It's about business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=4615)|
| 1:16:56| It's about how when this leaves this community, what will fill that void, what will fill that place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=4616)|
| 1:17:03| And also the people in the community, what are you saying to the people in the community?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=4623)|
| 1:17:10| I was visiting someone at what I call St. Mary's on Friday, a 90-year-old member of our church.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=4630)|
| 1:17:19| Thirty seconds, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=4639)|
| 1:17:20| She once stated to me she was the first black person ever to go into St. Mary's,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=4640)|
| 1:17:26| and several years later she's still visiting St. Mary's and being cared for there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=4646)|
| 1:17:31| What do we say to these folk who are used to going there and have to now continue to go out west?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=4651)|
| 1:17:38| We know we have one there at Fort Sanders, but what about St. Mary's?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=4658)|
| 1:17:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=4663)|
| 1:17:44| Thank you, Pastor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=4664)|
| 1:17:52| Okay, Council, that concludes the folks who have signed up to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=4672)|
| 1:17:57| Councilman Grieve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=4677)|
| 1:18:00| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=4680)|
| 1:18:01| I'd like to pass out to my colleagues a letter and a summation of the remarks that I'm about to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=4681)|
| 1:18:08| If you'll bear with me, I wrote these down because I do have a number of comments to make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=4688)|
| 1:18:14| First, let me say that I certainly appreciate all the responses from both groups on this zoning issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=4694)|
| 1:18:19| I've received many postcards, as my colleagues have, letters, e-mails,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=4699)|
| 1:18:24| telephone calls from the residents in both West Knoxville and North Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=4704)|
| 1:18:30| And I've also received calls from doctors and the medical staff of people with tenova.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=4710)|
| 1:18:37| I've read the correspondence, I've researched the points of questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=4717)|
| 1:18:40| and I've listened to the concerns of the neighborhoods, both in the west and the north,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=4720)|
| 1:18:45| and also tenova, the applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=4725)|
| 1:18:48| I've met and participated in the neighborhood meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=4728)|
| 1:18:51| and I've met with individuals from the neighborhoods and with tenova.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=4731)|
| 1:18:55| And I want to, first of all, commend both parties for their cooperation and civility towards one another.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=4735)|
| 1:19:02| Each of us on council are concerned with the impact of this project has on the two neighborhoods,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=4742)|
| 1:19:09| as well as our city, and have not taken the issue lightly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=4749)|
| 1:19:13| Let me begin the discussion by getting to the bottom line of the issue before council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=4753)|
| 1:19:18| and give clarity to what we are being asked to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=4758)|
| 1:19:22| Rezone a portion of the property located on Middlebrook Pike from agriculture to office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=4762)|
| 1:19:28| That would be approximately 60-plus acres of the waterhouse property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=4768)|
| 1:19:33| leaving approximately 40-plus acres in the agricultural zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=4773)|
| 1:19:38| Let me stress this request before council tonight is a rezoning issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=4778)|
| 1:19:43| and not an endorsement of tenova's application for a certificate of need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=4783)|
| 1:19:49| And, council, let me repeat that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=4789)|
| 1:19:51| This request before council tonight is a rezoning issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=4791)|
| 1:19:55| and not an endorsement of tenova's application for a certificate of need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=4795)|
| 1:20:00| In other words, what is before us is not whether a hospital should be constructed on the site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=4800)|
| 1:20:05| but how should the property be zoned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=4805)|
| 1:20:08| This is a land-use issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=4808)|
| 1:20:12| O-1 is consistent with the future land-use plan as shown in the sector plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=4812)|
| 1:20:17| and it is consistent with the one-year plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=4817)|
| 1:20:20| The one-year plan is reviewed every year by the residents of the area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=4820)|
| 1:20:24| and, in particular, in this case, by the leadership of the West Hills neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=4824)|
| 1:20:30| I'd like to ask Mr. Donaldson,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=4830)|
| 1:20:32| what are the problems with an A-1 zone for a hospital and a medical office building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=4832)|
| 1:20:37| and can a hospital be considered with an office building in an A-1 zone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=4837)|
| 1:20:41| This is one of the issues that has come before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=4841)|
| 1:20:44| And so, Mark, if you could comment to that, I would appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=4844)|

| 1:20:51| The A-1, or agricultural zone district, does list hospital as a use permitted on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=4851)|
| 1:20:59| That requires site plan approval by the planning commission before any building permits can be issued.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=4859)|
| 1:21:06| It does not address the land use identified in the zoning ordinance as medical office buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=4866)|
| 1:21:15| It is possible that a medical portion of the hospital could be classified as a medical office building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=4875)|
| 1:21:22| and allowed by permitting people as an accessory use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=4882)|
| 1:21:28| but it's also very possible that it may not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=4888)|
| 1:21:33| There would be risk there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=4893)|
| 1:21:37| The key phrase in our definition for accessory uses is that the accessory use has to be on the same lot as the principal use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=4897)|
| 1:21:48| and subordinate to and incidental to the primary use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=4908)|
| 1:21:53| And in today's financing world, it is quite common to isolate particular structures onto individual lots| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=4913)|
| 1:22:03| in order to get them financed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=4923)|
| 1:22:05| We have run into this on many occasions in dealing with the UT Medical Center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=4925)|
| 1:22:12| where they have shifted their financing schemes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=4932)|
| 1:22:15| and we've had to create lots for individual buildings in order to get them financed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=4935)|
| 1:22:24| So the scenarios in which a medical office building could be deemed not to be accessory to a hospital are many.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=4944)|
| 1:22:36| Whereas in the office district, the O1, which is titled Office Medical and Related Services,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=4956)|
| 1:22:44| hospitals are also listed as a use permitted on review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=4964)|
| 1:22:49| and medical office buildings would be a use permitted by right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=4969)|
| 1:22:53| So both of those uses are called out in the O1 district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=4973)|
| 1:22:58| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=4978)|
| 1:23:00| Mrs. Robinson, I'd like to ask, why would you not file for your certificate of need ahead of the rezoning request?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=4980)|
| 1:23:08| Is that a possibility?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=4988)|
| 1:23:10| It's not an appropriate option because a certificate of need is site-specific,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=4990)|
| 1:23:15| and the certificate of need process is extremely expensive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=4995)|
| 1:23:19| It's extremely time and resource consuming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=4999)|
| 1:23:22| So it would be very unwise for us to pursue a certificate of need for a specific site| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=5002)|
| 1:23:28| unless we were assured through the process that we would be able to actually utilize the property for that purpose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=5008)|
| 1:23:35| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=5015)|
| 1:23:37| As to the use of the property once it is zoned, making it consistent with the sector plan and the one-year plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=5017)|
| 1:23:44| there will be steps that the applicant will need to follow,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=5024)|
| 1:23:46| and at that time there will be opportunities for more public input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=5026)|
| 1:23:51| There will be the use on review and the variances that they must request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=5031)|
| 1:23:56| At these times, there will be opportunities for public to weigh in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=5036)|
| 1:24:00| The applicant is in the process of a very long and complicated application in applying for a certificate of need,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=5040)|
| 1:24:07| and there's a schedule from the Health Services and Development Agency from the state for the opportunity for public comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=5047)|
| 1:24:15| Before we discuss various concerns of the neighborhoods, residents, doctors, and Tenova,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=5055)|
| 1:24:20| I'd like to emphasize that there's another stakeholder in this issue who has not been heard or represented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=5060)|
| 1:24:27| This is the owner of the Waterhouse property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=5067)|
| 1:24:30| I've been in discussion with them, and I'd like to read a letter on their behalf and for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=5070)|
| 1:24:35| This is a letter from Charles K. Swan III, one of the owners of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=5075)|
| 1:24:42| Dear Councilman Grieve, I am one of the owners of the property at Old Wisegarber Road in Middlebrook Pike| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=5082)|
| 1:24:49| that is currently under contract with Tenova as a location for their proposed new hospital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=5089)|
| 1:24:54| The other owners are all members of my family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=5094)|
| 1:24:57| I appreciate the time you've taken in the discussion of our concerns in this process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=5097)|
| 1:25:02| and thought I'd recap those issues here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=5102)|
| 1:25:05| My grandfather, Dr. Richard G. Waterhouse, originally bought this property almost 70 years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=5105)|
| 1:25:11| That was before West Knoxville, as we know it today, had even begun to develop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=5111)|
| 1:25:16| A few of us can still remember when civilization stopped on the east side of Bearden Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=5116)|
| 1:25:21| Dr. Waterhouse was a surgeon here in Knoxville and used the property for years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=5121)|
| 1:25:26| as a way to relax away from his practice as a doctor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=5126)|
| 1:25:29| He raised horses, cattle, and just generally enjoyed the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=5129)|
| 1:25:34| I grew up in West Hills, attended West Hills Elementary, Bearden High School,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=5134)|
| 1:25:39| the University of Tennessee, and spent years with my grandfather walking and riding all over this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=5139)|
| 1:25:46| That gives me a real perspective on the issues here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=5146)|
| 1:25:51| Several years ago, we made a family decision that it was time to sell this asset.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=5151)|
| 1:25:56| This is the second contract for sale we've had for the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=5156)|
| 1:26:00| At some point, this property is going to be sold and developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=5160)|
| 1:26:05| Our family respects and appreciates your service on the City Council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=5165)|
| 1:26:09| and supports the process by which land use decisions are made| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=5169)|
| 1:26:13| so that communities can develop in a manner which advances the common good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=5173)|
| 1:26:18| We believe that, by any reasonable standard, the Tenova proposal meets this test.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=5178)|
| 1:26:24| The area across the street, the old Dow Farm, has become a very active center for medically related businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=5184)|
| 1:26:31| In addition, there's a great deal of light industrial activity in the immediate vicinity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=5191)|
| 1:26:36| as well as a fairly substantial utility substation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=5196)|
| 1:26:40| Apartments and retirement facilities are other significant property uses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=5200)|
| 1:26:45| within just a mile or two of our property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=5205)|
| 1:26:47| In other words, the city made a decision to change the nature of this historically agricultural area a long time ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=5207)|
| 1:26:55| I can remember the Dow Farm as it used to be, the Accra Farm, the Sherrills, the Ely's, and many others,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=5215)|
| 1:27:02| but that time is long past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=5222)|
| 1:27:05| I know there is some opposition to this development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=5225)|
| 1:27:08| Frankly, there's going to be some opposition to any development of this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=5228)|
| 1:27:12| People that live on land contiguous to the property have, for years, had our property to use in their own words| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=5232)|
| 1:27:21| as their own private nature preserve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=5241)|
| 1:27:24| We've been very patient in accommodating to our neighbors over the years despite repeated trespassing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=5244)|
| 1:27:29| including most recently representatives of the Friends of Middlebrook conducting a tour of the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=5249)|
| 1:27:35| as if they owned it for the new Sentinel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=5255)|
| 1:27:38| While as a family we respect the governmental process for land development activity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=5258)|
| 1:27:42| we also have a strong belief in the inherent American rights associated with property ownership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=5262)|
| 1:27:49| In looking at this development proposal from our perspective,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=5269)|
| 1:27:52| we would assert that concluding a contract with Tenova offers perhaps the best protection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=5272)|
| 1:27:58| that contiguous landowners will get from the effects of development of this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=5278)|
| 1:28:03| Tenova's development plan request is consistent with both the sector and the one-year plan approved by City Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=5283)|
| 1:28:11| It is my understanding that Tenova has agreed to leave the land south of the creek undeveloped,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=5291)|
| 1:28:16| thus providing a substantial buffer that would not be required by this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=5296)|
| 1:28:20| or other forms of development others may do if this concept is not successful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=5300)|
| 1:28:25| This offer by Tenova would seem to me a valid and generous offer to work with its new neighbors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=5305)|
| 1:28:31| in response to the concerns expressed by many who have reviewed the development plans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=5311)|
| 1:28:36| and expressed questions and concerns regarding those plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=5316)|
| 1:28:41| In their opposition to this development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=5321)|
| 1:28:43| I'm particularly struck by a couple of other arguments advanced by the opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=5323)|
| 1:28:48| Several of the people I've talked to representing themselves as organizers of the opposition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=5328)|
| 1:28:53| have advocated that the property should remain undeveloped and available for the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=5333)|
| 1:28:58| to continue to enjoy as a nature habitat regardless of the obvious trespassing issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=5338)|
| 1:29:05| It is my understanding in discussions with you and others that the City of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=5345)|
| 1:29:09| certainly does not have the available funds to acquire the property for this purpose| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=5349)|
| 1:29:13| and, in fact, given its other obligations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=5353)|
| 1:29:16| would not be in a position to maintain the property in this manner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=5356)|
| 1:29:20| if money was somehow provided by others for the purchase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=5360)|
| 1:29:24| Another argument which just seems to be propaganda on behalf of the opposition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=5364)|
| 1:29:28| is asserting that flooding problems in West Hills would somehow be worsened if this property is developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=5368)|
| 1:29:35| Just the opposite is true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=5375)|
| 1:29:37| What is now referred to as the creek running from the west to the east on the property from West Hills| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=5377)|
| 1:29:43| is not a creek at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=5383)|
| 1:29:45| It is simply the results of two factors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=5385)|
| 1:29:48| If West Hills was developed today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=5388)|
| 1:29:50| that development would be required to retain its excess runoff from streets, driveways, etc.,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=5390)|
| 1:29:57| rather than just dumping that water onto our property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=5397)|
| 1:30:01| There was never a natural creek there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=5401)|
| 1:30:03| simply the resulting accumulation of water from years of accepting that runoff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=5403)|
| 1:30:08| This issue was further exasperated when the city ran a sewer line through that area in the 1960s| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=5408)|
| 1:30:16| and lowered the, quote, creek area to leave our property even more vulnerable to that runoff water.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=5416)|
| 1:30:23| Tenova's proposed development will obviously be required to meet today's standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=5423)|
| 1:30:27| and regulations regarding on-site retention| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=5427)|
| 1:30:30| and, in addition, will design their water retention plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=5430)|
| 1:30:34| to much more efficiently handle the runoff water from the area of West Hills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=5434)|
| 1:30:40| We had the opportunity to have a family discussion about this process in the last month or so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=5440)|
| 1:30:46| Obviously, many in the family are concerned about the annual cost of owning this property as we currently do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=5446)|
| 1:30:53| Given what many in the family consider self-serving opposition by contiguous property owners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=5453)|
| 1:30:59| that see our property as their protected nature preserve,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=5459)|
| 1:31:03| there is a growing discontent within the family to continue to allow that situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=5463)|
| 1:31:08| We receive at least one proposal a year from someone offering financial consideration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=5468)|
| 1:31:14| for the right to harvest our existing timber.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=5474)|
| 1:31:18| If Tenova's plan is not approved, we will obviously consider these proposals more seriously in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=5478)|
| 1:31:25| Tenova's accommodation seems much more appealing than some of the obvious alternatives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=5485)|
| 1:31:31| In summary, my family has an obligation to all of its members to do all it can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=5491)|
| 1:31:36| to maximize the value of assets we own.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=5496)|
| 1:31:40| As such, we cannot continue to pass up opportunities that will allow us to realize higher property values.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=5500)|
| 1:31:48| Again, I appreciate your time and energy in reviewing all of the information regarding this development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=5508)|
| 1:31:53| Tenova has stated that it intends to build a new hospital somewhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=5513)|
| 1:31:58| It would be a shame if, because of the ill-informed objections of a relative few citizens| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=5518)|
| 1:32:03| as compared to all who will benefit from this new facility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=5523)|
| 1:32:07| the City of Knoxville were to lose yet another taxpaying business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=5527)|
| 1:32:11| Please feel free to contact me at any time if you have any other questions regarding this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=5531)|
| 1:32:16| Sincerely, Charles K. Swan III.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=5536)|
| 1:32:20| I do believe that Mr. Swan is being very factual and realistic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=5540)|
| 1:32:24| and I do not take the letter as a threat, even though he talks about the timber.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=5544)|
| 1:32:29| It speaks to their desire to receive compensation for the property and realize some form of revenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=5549)|
| 1:32:36| The property will be developed, and we need to have a proper zoning for whatever development takes place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=5556)|
| 1:32:42| Let me take a few moments to address some of the issues that have been brought before us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=5562)|
| 1:32:46| and see if we can make some sense of each of these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=5566)|
| 1:32:49| Some citizens have basically said that they do not want a hospital| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=5569)|
| 1:32:53| and do not think that West Knoxville needs another hospital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=5573)|
| 1:32:58| That issue is not one for this Council to decide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=5578)|
| 1:33:02| It rests in the hands of the Tenova Group as a business decision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=5582)|
| 1:33:06| their experts, and the certificate of need process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=5586)|
| 1:33:10| The ownership, management, and leadership of HMA has been questioned by some as to its uncertainties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=5590)|
| 1:33:17| but this is not something that we have control over,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=5597)|
| 1:33:20| and we are and should not be in a position to try to control anyone's business or their decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=5600)|
| 1:33:27| There have been a few exceptions, but in general, I believe that Tenova has been open and available for meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=5607)|
| 1:33:34| has tried to listen and respond to the request of the neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=5614)|
| 1:33:38| Beyond the particular hiccup that occurred,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=5618)|
| 1:33:41| I think that we need to consider what the possibilities of development of the hospital on the site| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=5621)|
| 1:33:46| will do for the neighborhood and for our city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=5626)|
| 1:33:50| There's a 40-plus acre buffer of woods between the hospital site and the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=5630)|
| 1:33:56| Also, Tenova has agreed to a green ray trail through the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=5636)|
| 1:34:00| My question is, would other developers or other potential projects agree to set aside| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=5640)|
| 1:34:05| over a third of their property for woods and nature?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=5645)|
| 1:34:10| We're in a discussion about the possibility of a conservation easement for that acreage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=5650)|
| 1:34:15| This is not a local decision by Tenova's management,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=5655)|
| 1:34:18| but one that is being pursued and is under serious consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=5658)|
| 1:34:22| I arranged a meeting with Tenova and Legacy Parks to have further conversation on this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=5662)|
| 1:34:28| This could, and I stress could, be a win-win for both the neighborhood and the hospital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=5668)|
| 1:34:36| However, let me stress this is under consideration and is not yet a commitment by Tenova.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=5676)|
| 1:34:42| As to other issues that have been raised,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=5682)|
| 1:34:44| there's been talk of flooding and possible archeological remnants on the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=5684)|
| 1:34:50| Tenova will be required to follow our city stormwater requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=5690)|
| 1:34:56| This will be an improvement over the existing conditions on the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=5696)|
| 1:35:00| If there are any archeological issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=5700)|
| 1:35:04| they will be dealt with during the development of the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=5704)|
| 1:35:07| and in complete compliance with the applicable laws of Tennessee by Tenova.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=5707)|
| 1:35:13| Other issues that have been raised are quality of life issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=5713)|
| 1:35:17| There are presently two major hospitals in the center of neighborhoods in our city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=5717)|
| 1:35:21| How has quality of life been affected in those areas?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=5721)|
| 1:35:25| Are we saying that basically we want the property to stay the way it is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=5725)|
| 1:35:29| One neighborhood does not want the hospital why the other would like for it to stay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=5729)|
| 1:35:34| The quality of life issue will be impacted by whatever development occurs on that property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=5734)|
| 1:35:39| and the quality of life will be affected by changes in the conditions to the existing facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=5739)|
| 1:35:45| Questions have been raised about size and height of the proposed project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=5745)|
| 1:35:50| The development on the property is only using about two-thirds of the land,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=5750)|
| 1:35:54| and not all of that will be buildings and concrete.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=5754)|
| 1:35:58| The elevation level of the entry of the hospital on the site is 940| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=5758)|
| 1:36:02| with a seven-story building being 80 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=5762)|
| 1:36:04| The top of the elevation will be 1020.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=5764)|
| 1:36:07| The surrounding elevation of the neighborhoods go from 940 to 1060.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=5767)|
| 1:36:12| Will the building be seen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=5772)|
| 1:36:14| Certainly, but consider the distance from the neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=5774)|
| 1:36:17| through the wooded landscape to the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=5777)|
| 1:36:20| Noise issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=5780)|
| 1:36:21| Yes, there will be noise, and there will be some inconveniences.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=5781)|
| 1:36:25| We all want progress, but we do not want change,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=5785)|
| 1:36:28| and I believe change will eventually come to this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=5788)|
| 1:36:32| I don't believe there are any other developments in the city that have a buffer such as this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=5792)|
| 1:36:36| between the neighborhood and the proposed project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=5796)|
| 1:36:39| Tenova has, through their architects, changed the layout on the site of the emergency room| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=5799)|
| 1:36:44| and the hillopad to address some of the concerns of the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=5804)|
| 1:36:48| Today's lighting standards are such that there is better direct lighting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=5808)|
| 1:36:51| for the parking lots and buildings, and no glare and light spillage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=5811)|
| 1:36:56| Signage will be controlled and made similar to the Dow Springs development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=5816)|
| 1:37:00| on the other side of Middlebrook Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=5820)|
| 1:37:04| Another important issue, and one that is always raised, is traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=5824)|
| 1:37:08| Will traffic be a problem?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=5828)|
| 1:37:10| Is traffic a problem?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=5830)|
| 1:37:12| Yes, of course it is, and it will continue to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=5832)|
| 1:37:16| As development occurs, so does traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=5836)|
| 1:37:18| It increases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=5838)|
| 1:37:20| Tenova has done the required traffic study, and in reviewing that study, which I have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=5840)|
| 1:37:25| it will be necessary to have turned lanes in and out of their property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=5845)|
| 1:37:29| and add a traffic light at the Dick Lowness Middlebrook Roads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=5849)|
| 1:37:33| It will have to be synchronized with the existing lights on Middlebrook.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=5853)|
| 1:37:37| We have traffic problems throughout the city, and I will request the city to consider| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=5857)|
| 1:37:42| a traffic study of the areas surrounding this development in order to look for solutions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=5862)|
| 1:37:47| to the potential traffic in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=5867)|
| 1:37:50| Tenova has agreed to share in a traffic study of the immediate area with the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=5870)|
| 1:37:55| All our feeder roads into the city are in need of study with solutions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=5875)|
| 1:37:59| Middlebrook, Kingston Pike, Dean Hill, Sutherland Avenue, Westland,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=5879)|
| 1:38:04| and these are just roadways in my district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=5884)|
| 1:38:08| Another question being asked is how will emergency services get to the hospital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=5888)|
| 1:38:12| A more likely approach would be the interstate to Wise Garber, to Middlebrook, to the hospital,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=5892)|
| 1:38:18| and not cutting through the neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=5898)|
| 1:38:21| There will be traffic and noise problems with any development that occurs on that property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=5901)|
| 1:38:26| but the question is will you have the cooperation and willingness of some other developer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=5906)|
| 1:38:31| to work as closely as Tenova has with the surrounding neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=5911)|
| 1:38:36| There are other issues that will arise and that I've not mentioned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=5916)|
| 1:38:40| but a major one of concern that all of us and all of us on council are concerned with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=5920)|
| 1:38:45| is what will happen to the existing facility in North Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=5925)|
| 1:38:49| and how does that affect that neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=5929)|
| 1:38:53| Tenova tells me that they are engaged in active discussions with potential partners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=5933)|
| 1:38:57| and potential tenants, but in every case are under confidentiality agreements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=5937)|
| 1:39:02| and cannot give us any more details at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=5942)|
| 1:39:06| They are absolutely committed to ensuring that medical services remain at the north location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=5946)|
| 1:39:12| They are looking at how the existing structures can accommodate some of those medical services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=5952)|
| 1:39:18| in the existing facilities and are looking at the demolition of some of the structures,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=5958)|
| 1:39:22| retrofitting of some of the structures for other uses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=5962)|
| 1:39:25| and also are considering open space for the neighborhood for the possibility of park or green spaces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=5965)|
| 1:39:32| There is concern that the north and the east will not have medical services if this hospital is built.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=5972)|
| 1:39:38| We must not forget that there is a North Knoxville Medical Center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=5978)|
| 1:39:41| where Tenova continues to add facilities such as they recently have added four additional ER rooms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=5981)|
| 1:39:47| and other services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=5987)|
| 1:39:50| With the above said, I want to again remind my colleagues that what we're here to consider this evening| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=5990)|
| 1:39:56| is the request for council to rezone the Waterhouse property to 01,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=5996)|
| 1:40:02| and this is not an endorsement of Tenova's application for significant of need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=6002)|
| 1:40:08| As a council, we are, of course, concerned about any development in the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=6008)|
| 1:40:13| and are interested in what we think is in the best interest of the area and the city as a whole| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=6013)|
| 1:40:18| as to the future growth and financial stability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=6018)|
| 1:40:22| We cannot ignore the fact that we are looking at a sizable investment in the city by Tenova| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=6022)|
| 1:40:28| and a sizable tax increase to the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=6028)|
| 1:40:32| Before I make a motion, I also want to clarify several statements that were made at a public forum| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=6032)|
| 1:40:37| in regards to a gentleman who questioned my involvement in this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=6037)|
| 1:40:42| I am in no way involved with Tenova in this project with any architectural services from my firm,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=6042)|
| 1:40:48| or am I involved with a firm providing architectural services to Tenova.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=6048)|
| 1:40:53| My only relationship with either of the architects who presented projects that evening| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=6053)|
| 1:40:58| was that I was their college professor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=6058)|
| 1:41:01| I will be supporting the motion to rezone and making that motion at the appropriate time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=6061)|
| 1:41:06| once there's been further discussion with council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=6066)|
| 1:41:09| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=6069)|
| 1:41:10| Thank you, Councilman Grave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=6070)|
| 1:41:11| Councilman Della Vopi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=6071)|
| 1:41:13| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=6073)|
| 1:41:16| This is an interesting proposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=6076)|
| 1:41:18| I've listened at community meetings to Tenova, to the residents, both in North Knoxville and West Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=6078)|
| 1:41:26| Lots of folks have showed up to show their support for one position or another.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=6086)|
| 1:41:32| And it's obviously a decision that has some momentous implications for our city and our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=6092)|
| 1:41:39| And I appreciate Councilman Grave's extended half-an-hour presentation on the reasons why they should approve it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=6099)|
| 1:41:48| But we come right down to the fact that we are making a decision tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=6108)|
| 1:41:55| that is going to really affect the inner city of our community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=6115)|
| 1:42:00| one that has been being built up for the last 15 or 20 years with positive results.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=6120)|
| 1:42:06| This council has, and councils before us, have put millions of dollars trying to increase the health of our center city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=6126)|
| 1:42:15| of our communities that surround it and radiating out from that center city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=6135)|
| 1:42:20| And Councilman Grave makes a very important point that we're talking about a rezoning issue here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=6140)|
| 1:42:25| and not planning the future of a hospital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=6145)|
| 1:42:29| I recognize that, but this is no ordinary zoning proposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=6149)|
| 1:42:34| We are taking an action that may well seriously damage both the physical community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=6154)|
| 1:42:41| in terms of loss of the housing tenants and owners of property, as well as the businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=6161)|
| 1:42:49| But more importantly, we're making a decision that will affect the lives of people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=6169)|
| 1:42:54| There are going to be people that will be getting in an ambulance and sitting in it for 15 or 20 minutes longer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=6174)|
| 1:43:00| and maybe dying or having irreversible effects of a stroke in an ambulance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=6180)|
| 1:43:06| as they turn blue working their way down to Middlebrook Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=6186)|
| 1:43:09| And I'm troubled by this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=6189)|
| 1:43:12| I'm troubled that as a city we have not sat down with Tenova or with Health Management Associates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=6192)|
| 1:43:19| or with Community Health Services or systems out of Nashville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=6199)|
| 1:43:24| But this decision is more than go, no-go on a zoning question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=6204)|
| 1:43:31| We are affecting the future of our community in a way that's very, very significant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=6211)|
| 1:43:37| Let's turn to the zoning question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=6217)|
| 1:43:39| We have to address that ultimately, but I don't think we can ignore the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=6219)|
| 1:43:42| We're changing the health and strength of our inner cities by doing this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=6222)|
| 1:43:49| Can we make Tenova run their hospital there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=6229)|
| 1:43:52| No, of course not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=6232)|
| 1:43:53| They're a for-profit corporation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=6233)|
| 1:43:55| They have a right to make their own decisions how they use their property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=6235)|
| 1:43:58| The gentleman that Duane read a three- or four-page letter from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=6238)|
| 1:44:02| talking about his family ownership of the property in West Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=6242)|
| 1:44:06| of course I respect their right to use their land any way they see fit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=6246)|
| 1:44:10| in accordance with the rules that exist out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=6250)|
| 1:44:13| It is privately owned property, but it doesn't mean that it's hospital or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=6253)|
| 1:44:19| Now, he makes a case that, okay, the hospital is willing to take steps| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=6259)|
| 1:44:25| that might provide more buffer than a less sensitive purchaser of the land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=6265)|
| 1:44:31| Probably a fair argument, but who knows?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=6271)|
| 1:44:33| We don't know what the future holds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=6273)|
| 1:44:35| We know that there is existing A1 zoning on this track.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=6275)|
| 1:44:39| The agricultural zoning by law is allowed to have a hospital under a use on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=6279)|
| 1:44:46| Tenova has that route fully open to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=6286)|
| 1:44:49| They say they can't go to a certificate of need process without having site-specific.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=6289)|
| 1:44:55| Well, they can dance the two-step and get the approval of having a hospital there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=6295)|
| 1:45:02| I don't think there's any question that MPC is very favorable to their proposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=6302)|
| 1:45:09| They'll hear from that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=6309)|
| 1:45:11| Our zoning laws say that you can have doctor's offices| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=6311)|
| 1:45:17| and other buildings as an accessory used to the primary use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=6317)|
| 1:45:21| So the question I ask my colleagues is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=6321)|
| 1:45:24| why are we deciding this question tonight when Tenova's, what,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=6324)|
| 1:45:31| both financial and corporate future is in flux| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=6331)|
| 1:45:35| when they have a clear route to buy and use this land under the agricultural zone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=6335)|
| 1:45:41| It strikes me that it's a pretty good hedge of a bet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=6341)|
| 1:45:44| for them to put the office zoning on this property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=6344)|
| 1:45:48| because if they don't get their certificate of need,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=6348)|
| 1:45:50| if they're turned away at Nashville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=6350)|
| 1:45:52| they will have increased the property value by millions of dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=6352)|
| 1:45:56| when they sell it to someone else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=6356)|
| 1:45:59| And I'm not saying that's their motivation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=6359)|
| 1:46:01| but I'm saying that that's a consideration you as council have to think about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=6361)|
| 1:46:05| This zoning goes with the land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=6365)|
| 1:46:07| This zoning is there, once put in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=6367)|
| 1:46:10| So the question is, do you rush into this decision or not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=6370)|
| 1:46:13| Now, I will give Tenova credit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=6373)|
| 1:46:16| They came to the neighborhood meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=6376)|
| 1:46:18| They spoke to folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=6378)|
| 1:46:19| They answered tough questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=6379)|
| 1:46:23| But not everything computes in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=6383)|
| 1:46:25| I mean, let me tell you, since Dwayne took the time to explain his view,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=6385)|
| 1:46:29| let me tell you a little story.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=6389)|
| 1:46:31| I had a friend who had a motivational tape for sales one time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=6391)|
| 1:46:35| and the neighbor came over and asked his neighbor friend,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=6395)|
| 1:46:39| can I borrow your ax today?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=6399)|
| 1:46:41| And the man said, well, I'm sorry, you can't borrow my ax because I'm making soup.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=6401)|
| 1:46:46| And the man stood there, and he said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=6406)|
| 1:46:49| And the guy said, well, if I don't want to lend you my ax,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=6409)|
| 1:46:52| one excuse is as good as another.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=6412)|
| 1:46:55| And there's the thing about the motivation of speech.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=6415)|
| 1:46:58| We have heard that the old building has a central plant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=6418)|
| 1:47:03| and we had the gentleman here who actually maintains it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=6423)|
| 1:47:06| and they struggle to keep the air fresh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=6426)|
| 1:47:09| And the guy said, well, I don't want to lend you my ax,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=6429)|
| 1:47:12| because I'm making soup.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=6432)|
| 1:47:14| We had the gentleman here who actually maintains it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=6434)|
| 1:47:16| and they struggle to keep the air flow going and all those things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=6436)|
| 1:47:20| But the reality is there are at least five bare lot kind of properties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=6440)|
| 1:47:25| that surround the buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=6445)|
| 1:47:27| And if Tenova wanted to build there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=6447)|
| 1:47:29| they could certainly build a brand new building with its own heating and air| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=6449)|
| 1:47:33| and steam and all those wonderful things freely contained| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=6453)|
| 1:47:36| without ever touching the old plant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=6456)|
| 1:47:39| They could do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=6459)|
| 1:47:40| They could move the major operations of their hospital in there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=6460)|
| 1:47:43| and they could then tear down some or all of the existing building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=6463)|
| 1:47:48| All right, let's face the reality.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=6468)|
| 1:47:49| They don't want to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=6469)|
| 1:47:50| The question is, at this point in time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=6470)|
| 1:47:53| should this council act on the zoning request,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=6473)|
| 1:47:56| or should we wait to find out if there really is going to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=6476)|
| 1:47:59| a certificate of need application by the new parent company| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=6479)|
| 1:48:02| when it steps in the door?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=6482)|
| 1:48:04| And two, are they going to have it granted?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=6484)|
| 1:48:07| I don't think we have to rush into this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=6487)|
| 1:48:09| and I think that we should leave them with their agricultural one zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=6489)|
| 1:48:13| at this point in time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=6493)|
| 1:48:15| knowing full well that it does not preclude a hospital| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=6495)|
| 1:48:18| and knowing full well that if a hospital is built there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=6498)|
| 1:48:21| and they came to us and said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=6501)|
| 1:48:23| you know, the bank won't let us build an office building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=6503)|
| 1:48:26| or the doctor to build an office building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=6506)|
| 1:48:28| without a separate parcel with no one zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=6508)|
| 1:48:30| that we're going to go along with that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=6510)|
| 1:48:32| because at that point the hospital's there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=6512)|
| 1:48:34| and everyone in this room on either side of any fence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=6514)|
| 1:48:38| in any neighborhood or in any corporation wants it to succeed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=6518)|
| 1:48:42| If it's going to be there, we want it to succeed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=6522)|
| 1:48:44| We want it to serve our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=6524)|
| 1:48:46| But I think there's a very, very, very serious issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=6526)|
| 1:48:50| about what are we doing to the future of our inner city?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=6530)|
| 1:48:53| What are we doing to health care in downtown Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=6533)|
| 1:48:57| in north Knoxville, in east Knoxville?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=6537)|
| 1:49:00| And I don't know that we should be complicit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=6540)|
| 1:49:03| in a decision that jumps the gun,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=6543)|
| 1:49:06| that gets ahead of the certificate of need,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=6546)|
| 1:49:08| that gets ahead of the fact that they have the right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=6548)|
| 1:49:10| to use a hospital on that property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=6550)|
| 1:49:13| if they purchase it and get a use on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=6553)|
| 1:49:16| They have architects. They have engineers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=6556)|
| 1:49:18| They told us about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=6558)|
| 1:49:19| They can submit those plans and have the use approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=6559)|
| 1:49:22| I mean, I commend them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=6562)|
| 1:49:23| They did a great job of working with some of the West Hill neighbors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=6563)|
| 1:49:27| to try to say, okay, how can we rearrange the emergency room| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=6567)|
| 1:49:31| and the helicopter pad and, you know, control the lighting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=6571)|
| 1:49:34| and all those things that one does to mitigate impacts?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=6574)|
| 1:49:38| That shows a positive spirit, and I commend them for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=6578)|
| 1:49:41| I ask the question, as a matter of public policy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=6581)|
| 1:49:45| as a matter of this council acting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=6585)|
| 1:49:47| should we find that this O1 zone is appropriate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=6587)|
| 1:49:51| is in the public interest?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=6591)|
| 1:49:53| At this time, I say no, so I'm going to vote against it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=6593)|
| 1:49:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=6596)|
| 1:50:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=6604)|
| 1:50:05| Councilman Campin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=6605)|
| 1:50:06| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=6606)|
| 1:50:08| Unfortunately, I've heard tidbits about most everything I was going to comment on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=6608)|
| 1:50:12| so I won't repeat a lot of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=6612)|
| 1:50:15| but I do want to bring up and ask some questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=6615)|
| 1:50:19| if Ms. Robinson would come up just to answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=6619)|
| 1:50:23| You know, just for the record,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=6623)|
| 1:50:25| what percentages of the current physicians regional are older than?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=6625)|
| 1:50:30| We've heard a lot about, you know, it's around the 1930s| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=6630)|
| 1:50:33| and all this is old and we can't make it happen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=6633)|
| 1:50:35| but what percent of that campus is actually pre-1972?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=6635)|
| 1:50:39| Because there's been a lot of upgrades since then to parts of the campus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=6639)|
| 1:50:43| I think the real question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=6643)|
| 1:50:45| and I may have to call in for some expert assistance here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=6645)|
| 1:50:48| but the real question is the connected nature of the physical plant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=6648)|
| 1:50:54| and the fact that while the buildings, many of them were constructed in the 60s,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=6654)|
| 1:51:00| 70s, 80s, they all have a central physical plant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=6660)|
| 1:51:05| in terms of heat, air, electrical, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=6665)|
| 1:51:09| So it's incredibly difficult,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=6669)|
| 1:51:11| and I think actually our architect, Mark Rowland,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=6671)|
| 1:51:14| may be able to help me with this as well if you need more detail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=6674)|
| 1:51:17| But extremely difficult to make modifications to that facility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=6677)|
| 1:51:21| because of the interconnected and relatedness of those systems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=6681)|
| 1:51:28| So it's not just about the age of each individual facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=6688)|
| 1:51:31| The other challenge that we really face is because of the way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=6691)|
| 1:51:34| that the buildings were constructed over time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=6694)|
| 1:51:37| and with some of the methods that are not as current as today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=6697)|
| 1:51:41| and some of the challenges just with the sloping of the property, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=6701)|
| 1:51:45| Just simply the inefficiencies in trying to navigate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=6705)|
| 1:51:48| from one portion of the facility to the other is just incredibly difficult.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=6708)|
| 1:51:53| And I believe those of you who were here for the workshop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=6713)|
| 1:51:55| heard Mr. Rowland say that of the 30 years of architectural work he's been doing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=6715)|
| 1:52:01| it's one of the most dysfunctional physical facilities that he's ever examined.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=6721)|
| 1:52:07| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=6727)|
| 1:52:08| Well, I mean, not to go into too much detail,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=6728)|
| 1:52:10| I've tried to do my homework and look at a lot of the background information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=6730)|
| 1:52:14| and some of the numbers that came out of that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=6734)|
| 1:52:16| are significantly less than building a new facility, of course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=6736)|
| 1:52:19| I mean, building a new bed tower and services building on the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=6739)|
| 1:52:23| would be around $60 million, $80 million or so,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=6743)|
| 1:52:26| and that's not just infrastructure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=6746)|
| 1:52:28| I mean, just from what I read, that includes asbestos abatement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=6748)|
| 1:52:31| demolition staging, that kind of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=6751)|
| 1:52:33| So the plan that Emory Road facility was built to renovate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=6753)|
| 1:52:38| and modernize the Oak Hill facility is still very viable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=6758)|
| 1:52:42| I mean, the credible firms, local and national firms,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=6762)|
| 1:52:44| Hames and Company and Barber and McMurray, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=6764)|
| 1:52:47| those plans are still very viable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=6767)|
| 1:52:50| and I think that should be on the table as an option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=6770)|
| 1:52:54| Let me look and see here what we've got.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=6774)|
| 1:52:58| I guess it isn't very much still possible to move some of those services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=6778)|
| 1:53:02| to the north section while renovating it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=6782)|
| 1:53:05| I mean, it sounds like it's a big burden to go ahead with that plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=6785)|
| 1:53:08| but it is possible to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=6788)|
| 1:53:10| As we looked at those four options that we reviewed in detail at the workshop,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=6790)|
| 1:53:15| you know, one of those options was to just leave things the way they are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=6795)|
| 1:53:19| That's an option that is not remotely acceptable to our medical staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=6799)|
| 1:53:23| We have many patients who refuse to come to the hospital at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=6803)|
| 1:53:28| And, again, I'll say it again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=6808)|
| 1:53:30| We have a very clinically excellent, architecturally challenged facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=6810)|
| 1:53:36| We looked at the option of moving all services north.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=6816)|
| 1:53:39| As we looked at that, we had specific medical groups| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=6819)|
| 1:53:43| that were not on board with that plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=6823)|
| 1:53:46| The cost to do so and the staging of that operation was complex in a way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=6826)|
| 1:53:52| that as we examined all of the factors there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=6832)|
| 1:53:55| we found that that actually would be a more expensive, more challenging option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=6835)|
| 1:54:00| The option that is viable from the standpoint of maintaining our ongoing business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=6840)|
| 1:54:07| serving the patients that we serve today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=6847)|
| 1:54:09| and meeting the needs of our medical staff is a replacement facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=6849)|
| 1:54:13| And while there might be the opportunity potentially to build a single bed tower,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=6853)|
| 1:54:19| a single bed tower, in addition to what we already have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=6859)|
| 1:54:22| does not resolve the issues of some of the challenges| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=6862)|
| 1:54:25| of accommodating the latest in imaging technology, the latest in OR equipment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=6865)|
| 1:54:30| and you can't do that on a single bed tower chassis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=6870)|
| 1:54:33| That requires an entire facility plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=6873)|
| 1:54:36| I got you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=6876)|
| 1:54:37| I agree to some of those points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=6877)|
| 1:54:39| It just seems like with the potential of investing, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=6879)|
| 1:54:44| half or less than what a new facility would cost| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=6884)|
| 1:54:48| would be in the best interest of the company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=6888)|
| 1:54:50| I mean, $150 capital savings possibly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=6890)|
| 1:54:53| So I guess just, you know, I'm in line with my colleague,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=6893)|
| 1:54:59| Councilman Della Volpe, the impact for the neighborhood, for the north,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=6899)|
| 1:55:04| it's too great to support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=6904)|
| 1:55:06| I mean, the issues of the – I mean, this is a land use issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=6906)|
| 1:55:10| but it's also they're linked together, so we got to look at that impact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=6910)|
| 1:55:15| So the jobs, the loss in revenue, retail sales in the north Knoxville area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=6915)|
| 1:55:20| is just going to be a tremendously bad thing for the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=6920)|
| 1:55:23| So I guess obviously I'm not hugely supportive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=6923)|
| 1:55:29| I mean, the rezoning, although it was out of our control,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=6929)|
| 1:55:32| the scenic highway designation should never have been removed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=6932)|
| 1:55:34| There were people who spent a lot of money investing in that residential area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=6934)|
| 1:55:39| and there was no public notice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=6939)|
| 1:55:41| And, yes, that's a state matter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=6941)|
| 1:55:43| but it still got the ball rolling on why we're here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=6943)|
| 1:55:53| It affects two distinct communities in the east and the north,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=6953)|
| 1:55:57| and I feel like we've put in the cart before the horse here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=6957)|
| 1:56:01| I think the certificate of need should be attained| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=6961)|
| 1:56:03| before we give support to this development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=6963)|
| 1:56:05| I still haven't seen a traffic study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=6965)|
| 1:56:07| I mean, you know, it may not be a huge issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=6967)|
| 1:56:10| but it's still a big issue that we need to see before we support the rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=6970)|
| 1:56:15| I mean, it's the second biggest ER in the city behind UT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=6975)|
| 1:56:19| I think the need is obvious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=6979)|
| 1:56:22| So the effects of the new hospital and eventual closure of Physicians Regional| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=6982)|
| 1:56:25| will cause job loss, reduce revenues, and retail sales in the immediate community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=6985)|
| 1:56:29| So, you know, also we have to consider the people in the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=6989)|
| 1:56:33| I mean, those folks that look to us as representation and support, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=6993)|
| 1:56:39| I haven't seen this kind of opposition on anything while on city council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=6999)|
| 1:56:43| or brief county commission appointments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=7003)|
| 1:56:45| So it is a big issue, and at times we have to go, you know, go against the will of the people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=7005)|
| 1:56:51| often a small group for the greater good of the community or the city as a whole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=7011)|
| 1:56:54| But this is not the case in this proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=7014)|
| 1:56:56| It's a large group of opponents that will be affected adversely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=7016)|
| 1:57:00| Supporting this rezoning, this new hospital development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=7020)|
| 1:57:03| is not for the greater good of our city, especially those affected north and west.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=7023)|
| 1:57:07| Redevelopment of Physicians Regional is the way to go to serve those that need it more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=7027)|
| 1:57:12| And I can't support it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=7032)|
| 1:57:14| It appears to me that there's more interest in profits than people, so I'm going to vote against it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=7034)|
| 1:57:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=7038)|
| 1:57:26| Councilman Stair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=7046)|
| 1:57:28| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=7048)|
| 1:57:29| As many of you know, I'm a part-time council member,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=7049)|
| 1:57:32| and my full-time job is I work for a law firm, Lewis, King, Krieg and Waldrop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=7052)|
| 1:57:37| And my firm is representing Tenova on this matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=7057)|
| 1:57:41| So due to this conflict of interest, I won't be voting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=7061)|
| 1:57:45| I'll be abstaining.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=7065)|
| 1:57:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=7066)|
| 1:57:48| Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=7068)|
| 1:57:49| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=7069)|
| 1:57:52| To be brief, this is a tough issue, and it's something that we've studied it for months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=7072)|
| 1:57:59| I think we've taken quite a bit of time to study it to some of Nick's points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=7079)|
| 1:58:04| My points are that we're not – this is not a vote against North Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=7084)|
| 1:58:09| It's not a vote against neighborhoods or for a certain area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=7089)|
| 1:58:13| It's going back to the land use and the private property rights that these owners have of this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=7093)|
| 1:58:19| That's what we're here to ask, and that's what they've asked us to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=7099)|
| 1:58:21| Is this a proper use for this property, for medical use, hospital use and office buildings?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=7101)|
| 1:58:27| That's what we're being asked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=7107)|
| 1:58:29| This is not a vote that says, yes, I think they should move their hospital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=7109)|
| 1:58:34| This is not a vote that says we should keep Tenova right where they are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=7114)|
| 1:58:38| We can't do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=7118)|
| 1:58:39| That's beyond our stretch of what we've been asked to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=7119)|
| 1:58:44| There are going to be exceptions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=7124)|
| 1:58:46| I think most of it is subjective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=7126)|
| 1:58:50| Is it going to increase the value of the property if you put an O1 zoning on it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=7130)|
| 1:58:53| That's purely subjective, and it might.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=7133)|
| 1:58:58| But that's not what we're here to talk about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=7138)|
| 1:59:00| Is this a proper use?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=7140)|
| 1:59:01| Is it a proper zoning for this property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=7141)|
| 1:59:03| I think it is, four-lane divided highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=7143)|
| 1:59:06| I think it's very unusual to find a developer that's willing to set aside 40% of the property as a buffer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=7146)|
| 1:59:13| In most O1 zones, you're looking at a 20-foot buffer, not 40%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=7153)|
| 1:59:20| So there's a good bit of that land would be protected by the hillside slope anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=7160)|
| 1:59:27| So I'm not sure how much of that is usable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=7167)|
| 1:59:33| We're not here to determine the financial vitality of their parent company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=7173)|
| 1:59:38| I'm not here to support their company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=7178)|
| 1:59:40| I'm not here to deny it or to speak against it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=7180)|
| 1:59:44| But we're here back to the zoning issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=7184)|
| 1:59:49| The O1 zoning is appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=7189)|
| 1:59:51| If we go back to Del Vopi's point that, you know, we'll be arguing about accessory use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=7191)|
| 1:59:56| We argued about accessory use here last year and defining it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=7196)|
| 2:00:00| And we had a showdown with a neighborhood on another issue in Fountain City.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=7200)|
| 2:00:05| And, you know, that was a really tough vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=7205)|
| 2:00:07| We argued about what is an accessory use and what it can be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=7207)|
| 2:00:11| And I think we want to eliminate that up front.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=7211)|
| 2:00:15| This is reasonable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=7215)|
| 2:00:16| It's not something that's against somebody and for somebody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=7216)|
| 2:00:20| It's whether it's a reasonable use for this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=7220)|
| 2:00:23| We're not talking about heights here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=7223)|
| 2:00:26| We're talking about we're not approving whether it's a seven-story building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=7226)|
| 2:00:29| This is just for what is permitted under the O1 zoning, which is, you know, a three-story office building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=7229)|
| 2:00:37| That won't even come to us unless it's appealed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=7237)|
| 2:00:39| So we're not here to talk about and grant them a seven-story building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=7239)|
| 2:00:42| It's for a different vote and a different time and a wholly separate different issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=7242)|
| 2:00:47| and probably a lot different issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=7247)|
| 2:00:49| Voting against this is not going to ensure that Tenova is going to stay there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=7249)|
| 2:00:55| And you're probably, I think, other companies like Holston Gas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=7255)|
| 2:01:02| that made a big investment in Old North Knox because they saw the neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=7262)|
| 2:01:05| and the improvements of the neighborhood and improvements the city has done over the years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=7265)|
| 2:01:09| They chose to move their corporate headquarters there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=7269)|
| 2:01:14| That's the same thing will happen here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=7274)|
| 2:01:16| Those same homes are there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=7276)|
| 2:01:17| Those investments are still there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=7277)|
| 2:01:18| The energy is still there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=7278)|
| 2:01:21| There will be other opportunities for businesses to relocate there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=7281)|
| 2:01:25| You know, saying no is using your vote to block what you think is a better business decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=7285)|
| 2:01:31| And we're not here to business decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=7291)|
| 2:01:33| We're here to ask about zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=7293)|
| 2:01:35| And it's a tough issue, and, you know, it's one that's given a lot of thought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=7295)|
| 2:01:42| I think what they don't tell you about this job is it's not the time we go to the meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=7302)|
| 2:01:47| As someone said earlier, it's not the time we even respond to phone calls or e-mails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=7307)|
| 2:01:53| It's probably the time we sit and study this in our own mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=7313)|
| 2:01:57| And that's probably the bigger investment of time, I can tell you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=7317)|
| 2:02:01| that I've spent a lot of time thinking about it and considering it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=7321)|
| 2:02:07| And I think it's probably the best thing to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=7327)|
| 2:02:09| So I'll be voting for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=7329)|
| 2:02:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=7331)|
| 2:02:12| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=7332)|
| 2:02:13| Councilwoman Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=7333)|
| 2:02:17| This is an issue that has brought a lot of anguish, I think, to everybody on both sides of the issue, to council, to everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=7337)|
| 2:02:23| We are here, as Councilman Gray pointed out and Councilman Mollis affirmed, to look at a land use issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=7343)|
| 2:02:30| We're not here to approve Tenova building a new hospital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=7350)|
| 2:02:33| We're not here to approve repurposing the old St. Mary's site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=7353)|
| 2:02:38| We're basically here to look at the waterhouse property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=7358)|
| 2:02:40| and determine if this is an appropriate rezoning for that property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=7360)|
| 2:02:45| I am quite amazed that 40% of the land is going to be left as a buffer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=7365)|
| 2:02:50| When this first came up, and I heard different possibilities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=7370)|
| 2:02:53| and I've talked to people about proposals in the past,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=7373)|
| 2:02:57| it really frightens me to think that we could have a big box store or two or three on that piece of property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=7377)|
| 2:03:05| and that stream or the water that goes through the property would be going through a culvert,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=7385)|
| 2:03:09| and all those trees would be down, and we would have trucks backing up to the houses about 20 feet, maybe 15 feet away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=7389)|
| 2:03:16| So I would not like to see that happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=7396)|
| 2:03:18| But I'm not here to be a cheerleader for Tenova or a cheerleader for the neighborhood of West Hills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=7398)|
| 2:03:24| By the way, I did look up in city data, and there are 3,500 residents in West Hills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=7404)|
| 2:03:30| And so that's quite a sizable number of people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=7410)|
| 2:03:33| And a lot of them we haven't heard from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=7413)|
| 2:03:36| Either they are supportive of the change, they don't care, or they're not aware.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=7416)|
| 2:03:41| But whatever it is, we have not heard from all of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=7421)|
| 2:03:45| One of the things that the letter that Councilman Gray presented made very clear is this land is going to be developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=7425)|
| 2:03:50| Tomorrow morning, a timber-cutting company could show up and remove all the trees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=7430)|
| 2:03:56| and all the things that we've heard make this particular piece of property special.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=7436)|
| 2:04:01| Read the city tree ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=7441)|
| 2:04:02| They can't take all the trees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=7442)|
| 2:04:04| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=7444)|
| 2:04:05| Well, a percentage of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=7445)|
| 2:04:06| Agriculture, they can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=7446)|
| 2:04:12| In addition to the Waterhouse property and this proposed site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=7452)|
| 2:04:17| across the street is the Dowell Springs pretty much a medical campus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=7457)|
| 2:04:22| The only building on that campus that's not medical is the FBI Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=7462)|
| 2:04:27| And there were a lot of concerns in the neighborhood when that was built.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=7467)|
| 2:04:30| There were some issues with lighting, some issues with other things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=7470)|
| 2:04:33| And they worked with the neighborhood and got those resolved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=7473)|
| 2:04:36| I think that Tenova, being the good neighbor that they would like to be, would take care of those things, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=7476)|
| 2:04:41| But we already have some infrastructure in place with physicians who some practice at the old site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=7481)|
| 2:04:48| some practice in the north, and some practice at Turkey Creek, who have offices in Dowell Springs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=7488)|
| 2:04:54| And it worries me that we are going to perhaps do something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=7494)|
| 2:04:59| And remember that Tenova has a long road to go to get approval for the things that they need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=7499)|
| 2:05:04| We could have spent all this time studying and talking about this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=7504)|
| 2:05:07| and still have that piece of property there a year from now looking exactly like it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=7507)|
| 2:05:11| But let's assume that things do go forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=7511)|
| 2:05:14| It just concerns me that we are not thinking about our medical future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=7514)|
| 2:05:20| The population center of the city of Knoxville is at Weisgarber and Middlebrook Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=7520)|
| 2:05:27| The population center of the city of Knoxville is at Middlebrook Pike and Weisgarber,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=7527)|
| 2:05:33| which is almost exactly where this is going to be located, assuming Tenova gets all the permissions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=7533)|
| 2:05:40| Repurposing an existing facility is very painful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=7540)|
| 2:05:44| Change in any neighborhood is very painful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=7544)|
| 2:05:47| But just as we cannot prohibit the Waterhouse family from developing the land or selling the timber,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=7547)|
| 2:05:54| we really have to look out for the best interests of the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=7554)|
| 2:05:58| There are city as a whole, residents as a whole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=7558)|
| 2:06:02| I've heard from people all over the city who are supportive of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=7562)|
| 2:06:05| I've heard from people all over the city who are opposed to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=7565)|
| 2:06:09| But the overwhelming thing is that we have a responsibility to the entire citizenry of the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=7569)|
| 2:06:15| I talked to some emergency personnel about the concerns with the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=7575)|
| 2:06:20| Ambulance is flying up and down the street with sirens screaming at 3 a.m.,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=7580)|
| 2:06:24| and that's typically not the way things work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=7584)|
| 2:06:27| They told me that they would be using the interstate and get off at Weisgarber to exit to this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=7587)|
| 2:06:33| There aren't any residences along that part of Weisgarber or that part of Middlebrook Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=7593)|
| 2:06:38| They'll wave at the postal workers and then pull into the hospital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=7598)|
| 2:06:41| So I think that we've had a lot of emotion involved in every side of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=7601)|
| 2:06:47| I think that Councilman Grieve has certainly taken a great deal of time to represent the entire constituency of the 2nd District| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=7607)|
| 2:06:54| and the city very well in gathering information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=7614)|
| 2:06:58| I'm particularly pleased to get a letter from the Waterhouse family and really know what their thoughts are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=7618)|
| 2:07:03| because for a long time it seems we've been disrespecting or ignoring their property rights| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=7623)|
| 2:07:09| and either using that land or making decisions that really are none of our business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=7629)|
| 2:07:14| So I will be supporting the rezoning tonight, and I would hope that this does move forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=7634)|
| 2:07:21| and we'll see where it goes as Tenova proceeds down the road if that's what they opt to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=7641)|
| 2:07:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=7647)|
| 2:07:32| Councilman Saunders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=7652)|
| 2:07:33| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=7653)|
| 2:07:36| Councilman Wallace and Councilman Palmer have said many of the things that I will be saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=7656)|
| 2:07:41| but I do want to comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=7661)|
| 2:07:43| Actually, all of the information, and we, all of us, have received an incredible amount of information,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=7663)|
| 2:07:49| both people that are for the rezoning and people that are not in favor of the rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=7669)|
| 2:07:55| But at the end of the day, as I think Councilman Grieve,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=7675)|
| 2:07:58| and I must comment on Councilman Grieve's very difficult efforts in obtaining information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=7678)|
| 2:08:05| and finding out exactly where we are and what's going to happen to that land,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=7685)|
| 2:08:11| but we now know that that land will be developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=7691)|
| 2:08:14| This is the fourth development proposal that I am aware of on that property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=7694)|
| 2:08:20| and while we're not voting on that proposal, as Councilman Wallace very aptly said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=7700)|
| 2:08:26| it's a proposal that I am reasonably comfortable with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=7706)|
| 2:08:31| I am concerned, and I think we all are concerned, with the issues raised by Councilman Camp| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=7711)|
| 2:08:37| and Councilman Della Fobi, because a neighborhood will be affected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=7717)|
| 2:08:43| And I have spoken, as I'm sure my colleagues have, to the folks at Tenova| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=7723)|
| 2:08:49| and to certainly the mayor and the county mayor and the school board and some other folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=7729)|
| 2:08:54| about trying to repopulate and make that community as whole and as viable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=7734)|
| 2:09:00| And it is a very whole and viable community, and we would very much like to maintain that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=7740)|
| 2:09:06| But I'm persuaded after listening to all of this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=7746)|
| 2:09:09| and actually the very respectful comments, quite frankly, that we have received, or at least I have received,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=7749)|
| 2:09:16| I know there is a lot of emotion in this, but I do want us all to remember that tomorrow morning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=7756)|
| 2:09:22| or two weeks from now, we're all still going to be neighbors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=7762)|
| 2:09:26| and I think we need to proceed in that manner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=7766)|
| 2:09:29| So reasonable people, and that's what I have seen in this process, is reasonable people that don't agree,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=7769)|
| 2:09:35| and that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=7775)|
| 2:09:37| I really respect that, but I will be supporting this motion to rezone that property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=7777)|
| 2:09:46| Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=7786)|
| 2:09:47| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=7787)|
| 2:09:48| I wanted to somewhat along those lines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=7788)|
| 2:09:51| I want to thank everybody for coming out tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=7791)|
| 2:09:54| I think it's been a good example of democracy at work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=7794)|
| 2:09:59| I think everybody has been very civil.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=7799)|
| 2:10:04| But I think for me, I think that this council has to show, if not some leadership, some direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=7804)|
| 2:10:15| I don't want to see everything moved from north Knoxville to west Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=7815)|
| 2:10:24| When I was a teenager, I participated in a demonstration because I could not be admitted to St. Mary's Hospital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=7824)|
| 2:10:35| Since that time, St. Mary's has become a good neighbor in this city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=7835)|
| 2:10:42| I've listened to all of the statements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=7842)|
| 2:10:45| I want to thank Councilman Grieve for that letter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=7845)|
| 2:10:48| Brought out some very good points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=7848)|
| 2:10:50| I've read the e-mails, read the postcards, phone calls, and whatnot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=7850)|
| 2:10:56| But to me, it's beyond a zoning issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=7856)|
| 2:11:00| It's beyond dollars and cents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=7860)|
| 2:11:03| Sometimes we have to do, in my humble opinion, what's best for the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=7863)|
| 2:11:09| And so I'm going to have to vote a no on this tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=7869)|
| 2:11:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=7878)|
| 2:11:19| Councilman Grieve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=7879)|
| 2:11:24| I just wanted to say that I do respect the comments from all my colleagues and those of us that are in opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=7884)|
| 2:11:32| But, again, I want to stress that, as Councilman Wallace said and as Ms. Palmer said, that this is a land issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=7892)|
| 2:11:41| I want to remind Council that the sector plan is already zoned as 01.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=7901)|
| 2:11:47| Also, the one-year plan is 01.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=7907)|
| 2:11:50| The one-year plan is reviewed every year by the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=7910)|
| 2:11:53| And the neighborhoods have agreed in the past that it is an 01.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=7913)|
| 2:11:57| And so, basically, what we're doing is we're taking the zoning and tying it in with the one-year plan and the five-year plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=7917)|
| 2:12:03| And, again, I think we all agree that we are concerned about the health and viability of our city and what does happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=7923)|
| 2:12:12| But I also think that I personally, philosophically, have a problem with us trying to tell a business what to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=7932)|
| 2:12:19| and the kinds of decisions that a business has to make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=7939)|
| 2:12:23| I don't think that's in our purview.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=7943)|
| 2:12:25| And so, again, unless there's other councilmen, I'll defer to Councilman Pavlis before I make the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=7945)|
| 2:12:34| Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=7954)|
| 2:12:36| Well, I really don't know how much more that I can add to the discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=7956)|
| 2:12:41| There's been a lot of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=7961)|
| 2:12:43| I can't remember an issue recently that we've gotten so many correspondences.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=7963)|
| 2:12:51| I mean, it's been overwhelming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=7971)|
| 2:12:53| And there's been, you know, support obviously on both sides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=7973)|
| 2:12:56| I haven't really been able to make my mind up about, you know, just from the e-mails and all the correspondences, what have you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=7976)|
| 2:13:04| And this is a tough issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=7984)|
| 2:13:06| There's no doubt about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=7986)|
| 2:13:08| You know what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=7988)|
| 2:13:09| I'm one councilmember that has lived through a major hospital closing in my district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=7989)|
| 2:13:15| And it had negative effect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=7995)|
| 2:13:18| I mean, there's no doubt in my mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=7998)|
| 2:13:21| But let me say this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=8001)|
| 2:13:22| There's also a future for that very site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=8002)|
| 2:13:26| So I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=8006)|
| 2:13:28| Well, I think I know how this is going to go this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=8008)|
| 2:13:31| And I would urge the councilmembers who have their valid concerns to work hard, to work with Tenova,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=8011)|
| 2:13:40| work with anybody that you can if something happens to the other facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=8020)|
| 2:13:47| I don't know if it is or it isn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=8027)|
| 2:13:49| Again, and it goes back to a land use issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=8029)|
| 2:13:53| The people have the right to be able to develop their property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=8033)|
| 2:13:58| Hospitals are good neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=8038)|
| 2:14:00| I don't ever remember one complaint in the 11 1⁄2 years that I've served here about a complaint about a hospital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=8040)|
| 2:14:09| So with everything that they've done, they've been, you know, very up front.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=8049)|
| 2:14:13| They've had meeting after meeting, workshops.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=8053)|
| 2:14:15| The acreage that they're going to use as a buffer, which, as many people have stated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=8055)|
| 2:14:23| if it was a, you know, they could come in and perhaps move three-quarters of the trees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=8063)|
| 2:14:28| I don't know how many trees they could move, but they could move a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=8068)|
| 2:14:30| And they could do really a lot of different things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=8070)|
| 2:14:33| So I think it's been addressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=8073)|
| 2:14:36| You know, I can't ‑‑ I've got to separate it from the other building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=8076)|
| 2:14:42| I think that's the right way to address this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=8082)|
| 2:14:44| So I will be supporting the rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130917_201911?start=8084)|
