| 0:02:21| our Savior, Jesus Christ.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=141)|

| 0:09:18| If I could just have one more minute, President of the University of Tennessee, Randy Boyd,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=558)|
| 0:09:25| would like to say a few words as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=565)|
| 0:09:28| Thank you, Lawrence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=568)|
| 0:09:29| I wasn't on the agenda, so I'll be very brief, but I just want to say thank you, Chairman| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=569)|
| 0:09:33| Nystrom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=573)|
| 0:09:34| Thank you, Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=574)|
| 0:09:35| Thank you all for this recognition for one of UT's outstanding alumni, one of our leaders| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=575)|
| 0:09:41| in our country, and helping to fight and defend us against this crisis that the whole nation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=581)|
| 0:09:46| is battling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=586)|
| 0:09:47| You know, we've decided that this decade will be the greatest decade in the history of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=587)|
| 0:09:53| University of Tennessee, and when this crisis came about, many people said, well, that goes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=593)|
| 0:09:57| out the window, doesn't it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=597)|
| 0:09:58| I said, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=598)|
| 0:09:59| This crisis is not going to defeat us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=599)|
| 0:10:01| It's going to define us, and Dr. Shea is done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=601)|
| 0:10:04| He's actually helping to make that definition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=604)|
| 0:10:06| He's actually pioneering a way to protect the entire pot world population through what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=606)|
| 0:10:11| he's invented, so it's just an incredible pride point, I think, for Knox County and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=611)|
| 0:10:15| for the University of Tennessee and the great work that he's done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=615)|
| 0:10:18| The only thing that I will disagree with him on, he says that he has retired from the University| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=618)|
| 0:10:22| of Tennessee, and I'll say in experience that you never retire from the University of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=622)|
| 0:10:27| We stop paying you, but you're always a volunteer for life, and so, again, we want to thank| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=627)|

| 0:12:25| I just, that's awesome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=745)|
| 0:12:28| So, and to thank all the press, I mean he's saving people and it's just brought so much| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=748)|
| 0:12:33| positive attention to our university.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=753)|
| 0:12:35| very strong moment of pride. Before and we're about to move into some of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=755)|
| 0:12:40| meat of the meeting, I realize that some folks may be here for their first| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=760)|
| 0:12:43| County Commission meeting. You may have some folks who may be watching the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=763)|
| 0:12:46| meeting from home. Just to sort of provide a really big picture of how| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=766)|
| 0:12:50| County Commission meetings work and are structured, this is actually the second| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=770)|
| 0:12:54| meeting of the Knox County Commission for the month of July. Last week we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=774)|
| 0:12:58| conducted our Knox County Commission work session meeting. At that meeting we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=778)|
| 0:13:02| made an initial push through the agenda, going over many of the items. As a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=782)|
| 0:13:07| result of that, tonight you'll see when we do our votes, we have consent agendas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=787)|
| 0:13:12| that have been made for both our general county business as well as for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=792)|
| 0:13:16| schools business. So you'll see us get to a point where our friends at the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=796)|
| 0:13:20| clerk's office will read all of those items into the record and we'll take one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=800)|
| 0:13:24| vote that covers multiple items. So a lot of the business for tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=804)|
| 0:13:28| has been done and that'll make things just a little bit more efficient tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=808)|
| 0:13:33| if this is your first time tuning in. So that said, the first thing on our agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=813)|
| 0:13:38| we're going to go through public forum, then we will set tonight's agenda, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=818)|
| 0:13:42| then we will begin to move through it. So tonight, the first person who signed up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=822)|
| 0:13:47| like two weeks ago, we have a special guest with us tonight. That's Mr. Ron| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=827)|
| 0:13:50| Berry, one of our peers who will be here to speak about NACO. He's recently been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=830)|
| 0:13:57| gotten a nice honor and Mr. Bear, if you could state your name and address for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=837)|
| 0:14:01| the record, and you've got five minutes. Thank you. Commissioner Ron Berry from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=841)|
| 0:14:06| Roan County 186 Emerald Cove in Rockwood. Mr. Chairman, thank you so much for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=846)|
| 0:14:11| opportunity to just talk just a moment about some organizations that are our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=851)|
| 0:14:16| organizations. We'll start with TCCA, an organization that a lot of you have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=856)|
| 0:14:22| attended. A lot of you are serving on committees with that organization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=862)|
| 0:14:25| That's our organization, and one of these days, if COVID-19 will allow us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=865)|
| 0:14:30| we're going to get back together as an association. TCSA, another organization| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=870)|
| 0:14:37| that several of you serve on the board. Some of you are serving on committees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=877)|
| 0:14:41| there as well. I wanted to mention tonight another opportunity that you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=881)|
| 0:14:46| have, and that's the National Association of Counties. Again, made up of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=886)|
| 0:14:50| commissioners from all over the United States and members of like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=890)|
| 0:14:56| organizations. NACO is our lobbying efforts in Washington. COVID-19 has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=896)|
| 0:15:04| consumed many, many hours of their time in trying to make sure that we, as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=904)|
| 0:15:09| counties, get our monies. If you remember, only cities were going to get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=909)|
| 0:15:14| money from the federal part at the beginning. NACO stepped in and said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=914)|
| 0:15:18| wait a minute, the most important part and the grassroots are our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=918)|
| 0:15:22| counties. The counties received money as well. There's vast opportunities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=922)|
| 0:15:27| for everyone to join committees in NACO. Right now, you can let our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=927)|
| 0:15:34| folks know on the TCSA office on the number of committees, and you're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=934)|
| 0:15:40| welcome to, and love to have you, because all of these organizations are only as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=940)|

| 0:15:49| see some tremendous things that have happened from all of these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=949)|
| 0:15:53| organizations, each within their own unique segregation of things that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=953)|
| 0:15:59| they're trying to do. I encourage you to get involved. I was just appointed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=959)|
| 0:16:05| chairman of the NACO Rural Caucus, which is 70% of all of the counties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=965)|
| 0:16:10| There's 3,069 counties and boroughs in the United States. 70% of those are rural.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=970)|
| 0:16:18| So you can see the impact that NACO has on these communities. Basically,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=978)|
| 0:16:25| every county that wants to belong to NACO has a lobbyist walking the halls of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=985)|
| 0:16:31| Congress for them in NACO. And Knoxville and Knox County, you know, you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=991)|
| 0:16:39| folks set the hub for everything that happens in our region. And we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=999)|
| 0:16:42| extremely pleased that you guys and gals are doing exactly what you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=1002)|
| 0:16:47| should be doing, and that's promoting Knox from Roane County. We spend as much| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=1007)|
| 0:16:51| time in Knox County, probably, as we do in Roane County. We appreciate what you're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=1011)|
| 0:16:55| doing for us. Thank you for belonging to these organizations, because without| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=1015)|
| 0:17:00| counties like yours, most of these would not exist. So thank you for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=1020)|
| 0:17:06| what you're doing. Thank you for the work that you're doing. And, Mr. Chairman,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=1026)|
| 0:17:10| I appreciate the opportunity to be here, and certainly let me know if we can do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=1030)|
| 0:17:15| anything from any of these organizations and just get involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=1035)|
| 0:17:22| Ron, a quick question for you. I know that you recently, are you now on the board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=1042)|
| 0:17:26| for NACO? Tell us just a little bit about your recent appointment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=1046)|
| 0:17:29| Okay, yes. This will be my, it'll be going on my third year on the board of NACO,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=1049)|
| 0:17:34| again, made up of representatives from all over the U.S. It's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=1054)|
| 0:17:40| depending on how many actual counties we have. And one of the things in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=1060)|
| 0:17:44| Tennessee that's really disappointing is we are not very well represented on a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=1064)|
| 0:17:49| national level. And what's really disturbing is, for most rural counties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=1069)|
| 0:17:56| the dues are $450. I keep trying to express to them, you can't hire a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=1076)|
| 0:18:01| lobbyist for $450 to look after your needs. The COVID-19 monies coming to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=1081)|
| 0:18:07| counties would more than pay for their dues for five or six or seven years. So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=1087)|
| 0:18:11| that's the thing that we need to try to get, Mr. Chairman. I appreciate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=1091)|
| 0:18:15| you asking about that, is that rural counties make up our country, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=1095)|
| 0:18:21| that's where NACO is doing most of this work for them. And it's because of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=1101)|
| 0:18:26| organizations like yours that are supporting the efforts of NACO that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=1106)|
| 0:18:30| they're able to do that. All right. Thank you so much. Thank you. Appreciate you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=1110)|
| 0:18:36| All right. Next is a Julie McBee. She's probably coming at 7 for us. All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=1116)|

| 0:19:09| wish I could come in and give the county praise. I'm sure not here to praise y'all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=1149)|
| 0:19:12| for nothing. Let's talk about the reality of facts. A couple weeks ago, we stood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=1152)|
| 0:19:16| here and gave the Knox County Sheriff's Department $1,500 in bonuses. Yet, the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=1156)|
| 0:19:21| news is right on time to remind us of Jonathan Bleakley, who was killed while| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=1161)|
| 0:19:25| hog-tied by the Knox County Sheriff's Department officers. Charmaine Allen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=1165)|
| 0:19:30| funnily enough, has found that the protocol of their behavior had no| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=1170)|
| 0:19:34| violation under the laws and procedures that we have here in our city, county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=1174)|
| 0:19:38| state. Then, we find out from the lawsuit a full description of the factors, and it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=1178)|
| 0:19:44| says that we are well within our violations of policy and discrimination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=1184)|
| 0:19:48| The funny part is, is that you all would rather spend money on police forces than| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=1188)|

| 0:20:04| COVID-19. And if you really want to get to it, y'all just honor the man who| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=1204)|
| 0:20:08| created the mask for this, but over half of y'all have refused to put the mask on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=1208)|
| 0:20:12| for weeks. So, what kind of slap in the face was that? Oh, thank you for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=1212)|
| 0:20:16| creating the mask to save our lives, but never mind the fact that we low-key| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=1216)|
| 0:20:19| don't even practice the policy ourselves or actually have implemented any type of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=1219)|
| 0:20:23| mandate to support Endicott County. County, you are on notice. Just like we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=1223)|

| 0:20:31| much so a fact that what happens in the city is very well the responsibility of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=1231)|
| 0:20:35| the county, especially for Knoxville citizens, because we pay both taxes. The| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=1235)|

| 0:20:44| needs to take place here, instead of sitting there putting all the pressure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=1244)|
| 0:20:47| on the city, y'all should be working together in a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=1247)|
| 0:20:49| collaborative effort. You talk about something looking divisive is how our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=1249)|

| 0:21:15| overall in the state, and I think we're number 13th overall in the country as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=1275)|
| 0:21:18| far as the location in itself, as like Knox County, Knoxville. That is pathetic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=1278)|
| 0:21:23| and there's no excuse for it at all. We have had funding for these situations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=1283)|
| 0:21:28| and y'all have taken that money and put it in places that it does not belong. How| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=1288)|

| 0:21:59| a policy of insanity almost, and again, y'all are supposed to be educated people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=1319)|

| 0:25:33| I thought that the main thing that made America so unique was the authority of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=1533)|
| 0:25:39| local government, but in the current situation, what would happen if local| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=1539)|
| 0:25:47| government decided to halt the 5G rollout for the safety of their citizens,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=1547)|
| 0:25:54| even though federal government has said to do otherwise? What happens in that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=1554)|
| 0:26:00| kind of a situation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=1560)|
| 0:26:03| Ma'am, I don't have an answer for your question. So does anybody know what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=1563)|
| 0:26:18| would happen if local government just went ahead and halted any further roll| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=1578)|
| 0:26:23| out to protect citizens, even though federal government has said not to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=1583)|
| 0:26:30| that? Anybody? Politically, what happens in that kind of a situation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=1590)|
| 0:26:37| Commissioner Beeler. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I would like to ask our law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=1597)|
| 0:26:46| director to weigh in on that question, if he would. My initial answer would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=1606)|
| 0:26:50| that there would probably be a lawsuit from the ones attempting to put the 5G| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=1610)|
| 0:26:57| infrastructure in, and a court would rule on whether or not we could do that, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=1617)|
| 0:27:02| I'll defer to the law director. The reason I didn't respond, I'm not a member of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=1622)|
| 0:27:09| Commission, but having been asked the priority under the United States as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=1629)|
| 0:27:14| federal law supersedes local law, federal law prevails. The local law has no| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=1634)|
| 0:27:21| jurisdiction over these so-called utilities by federal law. We can only| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=1641)|
| 0:27:28| deal with aesthetic issues and some minor distance issues in our zoning, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=1648)|
| 0:27:34| that's about it. So what would happen, the federal government would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=1654)|
| 0:27:40| mandate to this community to enforce the law. Each and every person around this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=1660)|
| 0:27:45| table has taken an oath to uphold the Constitution of the United States, the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=1665)|
| 0:27:49| state of Tennessee, the statutes of this state, and the charter of Knox County. So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=1669)|
| 0:27:54| they are bound to uphold the federal laws that come down upon them, whether| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=1674)|
| 0:27:57| they like them or not. This is not a particular policy decision. It's an oath| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=1677)|
| 0:28:03| decision that they've made, and as the law director, we will defend them in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=1683)|
| 0:28:08| course of their duties against all comers, but the advice we would be giving| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=1688)|
| 0:28:13| them is, as a former commissioner used to say, we're outside our lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=1693)|
| 0:28:17| In 5G and about 99.9% of all issues related to it are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=1697)|
| 0:28:24| outside the lane of this body. They don't have the authority to deal with it. So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=1704)|
| 0:28:29| that's pretty close to the answer I think that you want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=1709)|
| 0:28:33| Thank you. So that means basically we need to wait until January for Bill 2279 to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=1713)|
| 0:28:42| possibly be amended to restore more local authority? Is that about six months| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=1722)|
| 0:28:47| away we would need to just wait? The state legislature cannot restore any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=1727)|
| 0:28:54| authority that's in conflict with federal law. If you have a conflict with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=1734)|
| 0:28:58| federal law, you need to call your congressmen and your senators to have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=1738)|
| 0:29:01| the federal law amended that can give state law more power, that can give the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=1741)|
| 0:29:06| locals more power. All of those are debatable in court. Everything's up for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=1746)|
| 0:29:11| grabs, but right now if I were giving you advice, that would be the best advice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=1751)|
| 0:29:15| I could give you. Thank you. Since I have more time, I'll go ahead and just share| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=1755)|
| 0:29:26| further information about why 5G is so concerning to me. So human exposure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=1766)|
| 0:29:34| guidelines for radiofrequency microwave radiation used by the FCC are more than| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=1774)|

| 0:29:45| exposure. And the biological impacts of exposure have now been firmly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=1785)|
| 0:29:49| established since those 20 years. The guidelines have been the subject of an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=1789)|
| 0:29:55| open FCC docket since 2013 with no resolution, creating an uncertain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=1795)|

| 0:30:49| and the telecom industry, I feel, should not be forcing American citizens to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=1849)|
| 0:30:54| endure involuntary exposure to wireless radiation 24-7 in their own homes. So does| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=1854)|
| 0:31:09| anyone have a suggestion of the best way to battle this at that federal level| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=1869)|
| 0:31:16| other than, you said, contacting the Senate, Senator and? Well, Ms. Bradford, just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=1876)|
| 0:31:23| some general advocacy advice. Probably right here at public forum is not the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=1883)|
| 0:31:28| best spot to ask for advice. I mean, there's a whole lot of different ways to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=1888)|
| 0:31:33| advocate and to try to work with and influence your federal and state level| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=1893)|
| 0:31:37| legislatures. And what I just might, as a general bit of advice, would be perhaps| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=1897)|
| 0:31:43| offline, reach out to some of the commissioners or whoever your commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=1903)|
| 0:31:47| is, talk to some folks, talk to the office staff. Our state legislators are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=1907)|
| 0:31:52| now out of session, but they'll be gearing up soon to prepare for next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=1912)|
| 0:31:56| But their staff members work year-round and now might be a good time to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=1916)|
| 0:32:03| reach out to the staff of the folks in Nashville about that. I mean, frankly, if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=1923)|
| 0:32:07| you wait until January or December, then it's too late. So over the next six| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=1927)|
| 0:32:12| months is probably your best time to begin that process. Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=1932)|

| 0:32:24| able to share who I could call to find out if the 5G small cells that have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=1944)|

| 0:32:52| information, but I don't know a source to go to now to get that information on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=1972)|
| 0:32:57| these all these new antennas. There are over 20 that I've spotted in Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=1977)|
| 0:33:02| either the extra 4G LTE at close proximity or the 5G small cells. Well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=1982)|
| 0:33:08| frankly, off the top of my head, I don't know, and I would be more surprised than| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=1988)|
| 0:33:12| not if the members of this body had that type of answer kind of right on the tip| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=1992)|
| 0:33:15| of their tongues. I might look to Jim Snowden from our engineering team who| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=1995)|
| 0:33:19| often works with the right-of-ways. Jim might have an idea of who to follow up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=1999)|
| 0:33:22| with, other than, you know, you've just got a handful of suppliers that provide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=2002)|
| 0:33:26| that type of service from the AT&T's to the Verizon's, and, you know, my initial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=2006)|
| 0:33:30| advice would be to try to work with with directly with one of the suppliers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=2010)|
| 0:33:35| there, and it sounds like Jim has given you his contact information to follow up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=2015)|
| 0:33:40| because I'm also fairly confident he probably doesn't know exactly where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=2020)|
| 0:33:42| every tower is located.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=2022)|

| 0:34:06| I just want to mention first some encouragement for anyone else who is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=2046)|

| 0:34:52| against damages from cell phones, devices, towers, and antennas. So, just some more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=2092)|
| 0:34:58| information on it. All right. Thank you. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=2098)|
| 0:35:03| Is there anyone else who wants to, are you, you've got about 10 seconds left, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=2103)|

| 0:35:27| your name and address, and then we'll be moving on to our agenda. If, yeah, we can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=2127)|
| 0:35:31| have one more person, and then we'll be moving on to the agenda. So, thank you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=2131)|

| 0:36:11| should be a grave concern to this body, that I don't care what the federal, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=2171)|

| 0:36:35| ought to be concerned about that we've never dealt with or lived with, and I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=2195)|

| 0:37:00| nothing to do with concerns about radiation, per se, in that situation. It| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=2220)|
| 0:37:04| was an eyesore. I don't want an eyesore installed in front of my house without| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=2224)|

| 0:37:39| dangerous. There was one that just came out that talked about how our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=2259)|

| 0:38:18| most of the time, but he and I are in agreement. We're flying blind and have no| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=2298)|

| 0:38:35| resisting this and pushing back. The entire country of France, Switzerland,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=2315)|

| 0:38:44| this. So, this is not fringe. There are cities in California, there are cities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=2324)|
| 0:38:50| throughout the country, and we've got this paperwork that we can provide you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=2330)|
| 0:38:53| that goes through and lists all those. They, I mean, this is not fringe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=2333)|
| 0:38:58| wackadoodle people that have tinfoil hats on that are showing concern about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=2338)|

| 0:39:18| are not fringe persons, but right now we're in the midst, and this is actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=2358)|
| 0:39:22| quite frankly a dangerous moment for us, because we're in the midst of what has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=2362)|
| 0:39:27| consumed the national attention right now at COVID-19, understandably so,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=2367)|

| 0:39:50| that's right when all of this stuff got on our radar and got us really concerned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=2390)|
| 0:39:55| and we started having all of the issues that we're having. So, we're a bit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=2395)|
| 0:39:58| distracted right now with a major public safety concern. I don't think we need to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=2398)|
| 0:40:04| add another layer of public safety concerns that we just allow blow through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=2404)|

| 0:40:14| because as soon as those towers get paid for and get put in and get installed all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=2414)|

| 0:40:24| about from them, I haven't seen many corporations that like to spend all that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=2424)|
| 0:40:28| kind of money and then walk away from it. So, I would much rather make them pause| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=2428)|
| 0:40:32| before they spend the money and prove to us they're not going to harm our citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=2432)|
| 0:40:37| Okay, thank you Mr. Hill. Okay, that concludes this part of public forum. We| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=2437)|
| 0:40:44| will have another public forum as printed on our agenda towards the end of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=2444)|
| 0:40:47| the meeting. We now are at the point of the meeting where we need to finalize| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=2447)|
| 0:40:51| our agenda. I have heard from some of the commissioners, one of the items that was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=2451)|
| 0:40:56| on for this month's agenda, Commissioner Beeler had brought us a discussion item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=2456)|
| 0:40:59| I know that that was brought by one of his constituents who unfortunately| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=2459)|
| 0:41:02| cannot make it this evening, so we're going to move that particular discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=2462)|
| 0:41:06| item. Commissioner Beeler, do you think shoot for August or September? What's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=2466)|
| 0:41:10| your call on that? Well, my initial thought is we would shoot for August 20th| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=2470)|
| 0:41:15| work session, but I'll verify that with the constituent before we add it to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=2475)|
| 0:41:20| agenda next month. Okay, so we'll verify it, but Drusilla just sort of earmark it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=2480)|
| 0:41:26| and check with Commissioner Beeler next month to see if he, yeah, so I'm sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=2486)|
| 0:41:29| he'll follow up with it. Otherwise, I'll go over the other items here. Item 59,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=2489)|
| 0:41:38| that was Commissioner Beeler's, as we said, that will be deferred, where the agenda| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=2498)|
| 0:41:43| includes adds of item 29 and 52, withdrawals of item 24 and 41, on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=2503)|
| 0:41:52| non-consent agenda, items 1, 2, 3, 4, 27, 53, 57, and 58 are the non-consent items. Are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=2512)|
| 0:42:06| there any other changes that we've seen? I know we worked pretty hard through the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=2526)|
| 0:42:09| work session last week, so the agenda is relatively tight tonight. Okay, seeing no| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=2529)|
| 0:42:17| other recommended changes, the chair will entertain a motion to set tonight's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=2537)|
| 0:42:20| agenda. Okay, we have a motion from Commissioner Gill and a second from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=2540)|
| 0:42:24| Commissioner Daley. All in favor, please say aye. Opposed, please say nay. Okay, the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=2544)|
| 0:42:29| ayes have it. The agenda has been set. One thing I'll do as chairman's privilege,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=2549)|
| 0:42:35| I'm going to move the item that came from Commissioner, excuse me, from Clerk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=2555)|
| 0:42:40| Susano to the top of the agenda just to get that one done. He had put in a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=2560)|
| 0:42:45| request, so Madam Clerk, if you could please call that one out first. This is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=2565)|
| 0:42:50| on page 12, item number 53, consideration of a resolution of the Commission of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=2570)|

| 0:43:16| proceeds therefrom, resolution 901. We have a motion for approval from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=2596)|
| 0:43:23| Commissioner Jay. Is there a second? Second. Second from Commissioner Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=2603)|
| 0:43:30| Okay, is there any additional discussion on this particular item? Yes, Commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=2610)|
| 0:43:35| Anderson. Yeah, yes, sir. I noticed it's Chris. I'm sorry, Chris. I noticed we had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=2615)|
| 0:43:42| made some changes on the resolution and did we define benchmarks or, I mean, is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=2622)|
| 0:43:52| this just a, I mean, the Commission has to, I mean, I'm for this because it's the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=2632)|
| 0:43:56| only alternative, it's the best alternative, but I mean it can't be just an open book,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=2636)|
| 0:44:00| right? So what are the benchmarks and how often is the Commission going to ask to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=2640)|
| 0:44:04| see something that says we're doing better or we're doing worse? I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=2644)|
| 0:44:09| ultimately what we've talked about internally is it's hard for us to put a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=2649)|
| 0:44:17| benchmark on years of repayment without knowing a total. So I think for us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=2657)|
| 0:44:24| whether it's a clerk, who's on with the finance department, we could bring you a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=2664)|
| 0:44:31| monthly total, you know, to send that to you all every month to know what that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=2671)|
| 0:44:36| total is and then we envision repayment plans of something like eight to ten| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=2676)|
| 0:44:42| years or something like that. And so, but not knowing what the total is going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=2682)|
| 0:44:47| be, I don't expect it to get anywhere near the 1.5 million. I think it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=2687)|
| 0:44:52| probably somewhere south of 500,000 and then figure out what we think is a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=2692)|
| 0:44:57| reasonable repayment plan. So, Mr. Chairman, if the maker of the motion will accept a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=2697)|
| 0:45:03| friendly amendment of a monthly report of the drawdown on that account, I would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=2703)|
| 0:45:07| like to see that. All right, I'll look to the maker of the motion. I see a nod and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=2707)|
| 0:45:13| a thumbs up. So the record could reflect that friendly amendment. Madam Clerk, is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=2713)|
| 0:45:20| there any additional discussion on this item? Okay, yes, Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=2720)|
| 0:45:24| Thank You, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Caldwell, does Mayor Jacobs have to notify the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=2724)|
| 0:45:33| Director of the Division of Local Government of Finance that this is what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=2733)|
| 0:45:39| we're going to do? And is that Betsy Knott's? It will be the comptroller, so I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=2739)|
| 0:45:48| think it'll be actually go to Justin Wilson. And so, once Commission approves| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=2748)|
| 0:45:54| this tonight, then we will send that forward to the comptroller for their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=2754)|
| 0:46:00| approval of this, what they would call an inter-fund loan. Okay, well, since Knox| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=2760)|
| 0:46:09| County has an overnight rate of 1% that we're getting on our deposits, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=2769)|
| 0:46:17| we have a fiduciary responsibility to the taxpayers of Knox County. I'm just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=2777)|
| 0:46:22| not comfortable with a interest-free loan by a department within Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=2782)|
| 0:46:30| when we're going to take money out of our general fund that we could be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=2790)|
| 0:46:34| earning interest on. Have you any thoughts about that from your department?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=2794)|
| 0:46:42| Yeah, I talked to the clerk today about that, and we're both amenable to putting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=2802)|
| 0:46:52| attaching an interest rate equal to the trustee's overnight account because that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=2812)|
| 0:46:58| can change every month. And so, if that's a caveat that you want to add, we can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=2818)|
| 0:47:03| can track that and just add that to what the payback is. So, tonight we're not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=2823)|
| 0:47:10| actually going to get a repayment schedule from the Circuit Court Clerk's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=2830)|
| 0:47:15| Office. No, I think ultimately it's this. I don't know, it's kind of hard, and I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=2835)|
| 0:47:21| don't want to speak for Charlie, but from the Finance Department, it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=2841)|
| 0:47:27| difficult for us to put forward a repayment schedule without knowing what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=2847)|
| 0:47:32| that total is. I'll give you an example. We talked about this today. We once did an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=2852)|
| 0:47:40| advance to CAC, and the repayment schedule wasn't put in place, and it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=2860)|
| 0:47:47| been slow, but we do have a loan with CAC that does get repaid every month. And so,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=2867)|
| 0:47:53| ultimately, I think the terms of the repayment can be set once we know what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=2873)|
| 0:47:59| the total amount is borrowed, and then we come back with eight to ten years to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=2879)|
| 0:48:04| pay that back. Okay, okay. I just, you know, from my standpoint, I just have a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=2884)|
| 0:48:22| kind of a problem. Everything kind of being not in black and white at this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=2902)|
| 0:48:29| point in time, that we don't have the exact numbers for any kind of a repayment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=2909)|
| 0:48:33| program, and or I have some kind of proposal from that office saying here's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=2913)|
| 0:48:40| what I intend to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=2920)|
| 0:48:48| I mean, I don't want to speak for Charlie. I mean, we could set it at eight or ten years, and if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=2928)|
| 0:48:54| that needs to be amended, come back. Ultimately, I think it's just without| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=2934)|
| 0:49:03| knowing what that total is. I mean, if you all want to set that at a limit, that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=2943)|
| 0:49:09| okay. I mean, we don't have any issues. I know that Charlie wants to get it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=2949)|
| 0:49:14| paid back as quickly as possible, and the terms that we set would be fine, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=2954)|
| 0:49:19| what we talked about internally today in the finance department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=2959)|
| 0:49:24| was something that would be eight to ten years. Okay, and then what is their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=2964)|
| 0:49:30| timetable that they will be out of money this year, if they did not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=2970)|
| 0:49:34| get the loan? I think ultimately, if there is no loan, I think it was end of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=2974)|
| 0:49:39| September, October range, when if things stayed like they are, that's when| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=2979)|
| 0:49:46| they would run out of cash. Okay, I'd like to make a substitute motion that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=2986)|
| 0:49:54| include all the items that were given by the original maker of the motion, but to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=2994)|
| 0:50:00| include the 1% overnight rate as the loan amount, the interest rate for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=3000)|
| 0:50:07| loan. Could you make it to where it's truly month-to-month, so that we don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=3007)|
| 0:50:11| make money on the deal? Well, the overnight rate, it may go up or down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=3011)|
| 0:50:16| but we've got that locked in through the trustee's office. That's good for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=3016)|
| 0:50:22| basically about, I mean that can change, but basically we know at least for 90| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=3022)|
| 0:50:27| days, equal to the overnight rate. Thank you, sir. Yes, that's, thank you. Okay, so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=3027)|
| 0:50:36| there's a substitute motion on the floor, which is everything stated in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=3036)|
| 0:50:41| original motion, with the friendly amendment, to have the interest rate be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=3041)|
| 0:50:47| equal to the overnight rate as calculated, not on a nightly basis, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=3047)|
| 0:50:53| on a monthly, on a nightly basis. It seems like we're potentially creating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=3053)|
| 0:50:58| an awful lot of work there on that, but. I'll let Mr. Caldwell explain this, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=3058)|
| 0:51:03| the trustee, he's got an agreement with BB&T for. I'm quite familiar with it, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=3063)|
| 0:51:08| Yes, yeah. I'm just talking about calculating if it needs to be calculated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=3068)|
| 0:51:13| every night, but if it varies. But go ahead, Mr. Caldwell. We can run a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=3073)|
| 0:51:22| program where it'll calculate monthly, and then we'll send that to Charlie, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=3082)|
| 0:51:26| then that'll be part of the payback plan. Okay, all right. Is there a second for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=3086)|
| 0:51:32| Commissioner Skinmaker's substitute motion? Second. All right, there's a second| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=3092)|
| 0:51:36| from Commissioner Anders. Okay, all right. What's on the floor now is the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=3096)|
| 0:51:43| substitute motion, which we're still a lot of questions that we have just about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=3103)|
| 0:51:47| this in general. So before we do any kind of vote, what I'd like to do is get a lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=3107)|
| 0:51:51| of these general questions that popped up with the lights before we move on to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=3111)|
| 0:51:54| a vote, and then we can get on to find out if the substitute motion is going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=3114)|
| 0:51:58| pass, or we'll be back to the original motion, if that's amenable to this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=3118)|
| 0:52:03| body. So with that said, Mr. Skinmaker, your light is off. The order of the lights I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=3123)|
| 0:52:10| have is back to, after, we'll go to Commissioner Smith, Carringer, Beeler, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=3130)|
| 0:52:16| then Gill, and then back to Commissioner Jay. All right, yeah, Jay, you made the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=3136)|
| 0:52:21| motion, so excuse me, so we'll go, it's Smith, Carringer, Jay, Beeler, and then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=3141)|
| 0:52:28| back to Commissioner Gill in order of the lights. Am I missing any of them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=3148)|
| 0:52:31| Commissioner Carringer? All right, thank you. All right, so back to you, Commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=3151)|
| 0:52:36| Smith. Thank you, Mr. Chair. Chris, I think you stated that the, Charlie has enough| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=3156)|
| 0:52:44| money to last through September or October at his current level of filings, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=3164)|
| 0:52:49| Yeah, I think I could let him speak to that, he could do a bit better than I, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=3169)|
| 0:52:54| ultimately, if their pace keeps on what they're thinking, then they would run out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=3174)|
| 0:52:59| of cash in the September, 1st of October. Okay, and at the current, come on down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=3179)|
| 0:53:07| Charlie, at your current level of filings and workflow, I believe you had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=3187)|
| 0:53:14| stated earlier, you're at about 70%, back up to about 70%, so doing some quick| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=3194)|
| 0:53:21| math, it looks like on a bad month, you may need $30,000 to make payroll. I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=3201)|
| 0:53:25| that's a fair estimate, Commissioner. So doing the 12-month forward, I think Chris| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=3205)|
| 0:53:31| had said earlier, you're looking at maybe $300,000 to $400,000 if things don't improve much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=3211)|
| 0:53:36| Worst-case scenario. Okay, Chris, we're setting up one and a half million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=3216)|
| 0:53:41| dollars here. We explained the reason behind that, is it fear that we may| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=3221)|
| 0:53:46| have other fee offices that may need this same kind of assistance and we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=3226)|
| 0:53:51| don't want to keep going back to the state? Sure, great, great question, and let me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=3231)|
| 0:53:56| expand on what I, on the answer. The answer is simply yes, and so, but to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=3236)|
| 0:54:03| expand, it'd be more like this. Knowing we're going to the comptroller,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=3243)|
| 0:54:09| assuming this gets approved, to ask for a loan, and an Interfund loan, anytime you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=3249)|
| 0:54:14| ask for an Interfund loan, it's got to be approved by the comptroller. We set| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=3254)|
| 0:54:20| down, and Perry and I sat down with our external auditors and said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=3260)|
| 0:54:25| here's our thought process, here's our plan, do you agree? And they agreed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=3265)|
| 0:54:30| with their logic, which was, let's go ahead and ask for what we think is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=3270)|
| 0:54:37| the top amount that could ever be given. Like, we wouldn't ever give more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=3277)|
| 0:54:43| than a year's worth of salary, because then we just put them into the budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=3283)|
| 0:54:48| system, and so our thought process was, yeah, we think he's going to use two, three,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=3288)|
| 0:54:53| four hundred thousand dollars, but if the courts close again in the fall or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=3293)|
| 0:54:59| the spring, and then it's not only him, maybe it extends to the chancery and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=3299)|
| 0:55:04| probate, then we have to go back and ask the comptroller for an additional loan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=3304)|
| 0:55:08| We wanted to just go to the well one time, so to speak, and so we don't think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=3308)|
| 0:55:14| he's going to get close to the 1.5, but we also don't want to go back there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=3314)|
| 0:55:19| every time we may go over an amount to ask the comptroller to keep on approving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=3319)|
| 0:55:24| Okay, is there anything from the state comptroller about the length of this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=3324)|
| 0:55:30| loan, how long it can be, and is there anything from the law director, anything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=3330)|
| 0:55:34| that prohibits a current office holder for extending the loan beyond what may| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=3334)|
| 0:55:38| be their term?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=3338)|
| 0:55:44| The actual contractual agreement will be between the clerk's office and the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=3344)|
| 0:55:49| county. It's just like any other contract, you know, if a mayor signs it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=3349)|
| 0:55:54| the new mayor comes in, the contract stands for itself and the agreement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=3354)|
| 0:55:59| stands for itself for whatever the meeting of the minds were at that time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=3359)|
| 0:56:02| so I don't think it has any bearing as to who's in the particular elected| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=3362)|
| 0:56:06| office at the time. It's between the legal organization, two legal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=3366)|
| 0:56:10| organizations, and they're acting as agents on behalf of the public and this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=3370)|
| 0:56:15| commission on behalf of the public to solidify that agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=3375)|
| 0:56:21| Charlie, you had said that your office operates on the twelve and a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=3381)|
| 0:56:27| half percent margin. When were the last time, and these are fees, they're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=3387)|
| 0:56:32| user fees, they're not taxes, when were the last time those fees were adjusted?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=3392)|
| 0:56:37| I believe, and I had a long conversation with the Hamilton County Circuit Court| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=3397)|
| 0:56:42| clerk today, Commissioner, and they are also suffering, you know, pretty severe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=3402)|
| 0:56:46| losses around about where we are. Now their office functions a little bit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=3406)|
| 0:56:51| differently because they have a little more revenue coming in because they are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=3411)|
| 0:56:55| they are under over their criminal sessions, our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=3415)|
| 0:57:00| criminal sessions. The previous clerk, something happened years back and we no| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=3420)|
| 0:57:05| longer are over the criminal session, so we lost a significant amount of revenue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=3425)|
| 0:57:08| there. But again, tell me again your question, the twelve and a half percent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=3428)|
| 0:57:16| they've not seen a revenue increase since I believe 2004. He and I discussed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=3436)|
| 0:57:21| that today. So the fees have remained the same since 2004? That's correct, and that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=3441)|
| 0:57:24| correct, and my understanding is, you know, that has to be a statewide increase. So,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=3444)|
| 0:57:31| you know, we would have to be involved with with the Clerks Association, but I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=3451)|
| 0:57:34| can tell you there has been no fee increase across the board since 2004. So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=3454)|
| 0:57:41| all clerks across the state are working off that same fee-based system? I can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=3461)|
| 0:57:47| tell you that Knox County operates on a different fee-based system. My| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=3467)|
| 0:57:52| understanding is that across the state these offices operate on what's called| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=3472)|
| 0:57:57| the flat fee system. Currently with Clerk and Master Hogan, we were discussing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=3477)|
| 0:58:04| and looking at, you know, whether the revenues would rise or fall if we went| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=3484)|
| 0:58:09| to a flat fee system. So it's very involved and we're going to look at each| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=3489)|
| 0:58:14| fee individually, so you can imagine there's quite a bit that goes into it, to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=3494)|
| 0:58:18| see if at the end of the day, if we go to a flat fee system, it's the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=3498)|
| 0:58:23| system we're on now is a system that I inherited through the previous| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=3503)|
| 0:58:26| administrations. If we go to a flat fee system, does it benefit Knox County? Our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=3506)|
| 0:58:32| decision will be based solely on that. Does it appear to increase| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=3512)|
| 0:58:36| revenues? And so we'll take a good, we are taking a good hard look at that and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=3516)|
| 0:58:40| we'll continue to as we go forward. The flat fee you can go to without having to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=3520)|
| 0:58:48| go to the state to have permission to go to it, but to have a fee increase the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=3528)|
| 0:58:53| state has to approve it? That's correct, sir. Thank you, sir. Thank you. Thanks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=3533)|
| 0:58:57| Commissioner Smith. Commissioner Carringer. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. This| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=3537)|
| 0:59:02| is more, I guess, more so for statement or whatever, but for everybody in public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=3542)|
| 0:59:10| and especially the public, but our fee offices are required to keep three months| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=3550)|
| 0:59:15| of salary at all times, so that so that everybody, you know, knows that, so that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=3555)|
| 0:59:24| you, that you're required by state and all to have three months of salary in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=3564)|
| 0:59:29| your bank. So with that being said, it really, I mean, it comes down to, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=3569)|
| 0:59:36| us being on Commission, I mean, we have two choices. I mean, one would be to say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=3576)|
| 0:59:42| no, but then the question I would have for Mr. Susano, you would have to lay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=3582)|
| 0:59:47| your employees off, correct? Thank you, Commissioner. I can tell you that with a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=3587)|
| 0:59:56| 60 to 70 percent revenue shortfall, decrease in revenues because of COVID,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=3596)|
| 1:00:03| and that's why we're here, there is no, you would have to lay off your entire| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=3603)|
| 1:00:08| staff and you would not be able to make up that revenue shortfall. You know, we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=3608)|
| 1:00:16| are still required to keep an essential staff. We keep that essential staff. We| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=3616)|
| 1:00:23| operate on a bare-bones number of employees anyway. My conversation with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=3623)|
| 1:00:28| the, for example, the Hamilton County Clerk today, he asked me how many people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=3628)|
| 1:00:32| we had currently working in our circuit office and I told him eight. Now they, I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=3632)|
| 1:00:35| believe, correct me if I'm wrong, I think their population size is a little bit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=3635)|
| 1:00:39| smaller than ours. Is that incorrect? Yeah, okay, that's correct. He told me they have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=3639)|
| 1:00:43| 32 employees in their office. So any suggestion, and you're not making that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=3643)|
| 1:00:48| suggestion with respect, Commissioner, there's not a number. We still have a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=3648)|
| 1:00:54| constitutional obligation to staff these offices. We have to be there and we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=3654)|
| 1:01:00| been there and we have maintained long before I became the clerk, but we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=3660)|
| 1:01:05| still maintained on a very slim margin, you know, keeping in mind that we we pay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=3665)|
| 1:01:12| out 2.5 million dollars each year to the county and state, you know, providing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=3672)|
| 1:01:18| assistance to our schools, our sheriffs, our libraries, the judges, and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=3678)|
| 1:01:22| We are still maintaining, but when a pandemic of this nature comes along and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=3682)|
| 1:01:27| it is affecting offices across the state, and I'm sure it's affecting offices, you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=3687)|
| 1:01:32| know, right here in Knox County, that's something that that no amount of employee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=3692)|
| 1:01:37| layoffs is going to solve. I thank you for your question. Yes, and that's what I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=3697)|
| 1:01:41| wanted to make sure was known to the public, and many, many, many years ago I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=3701)|
| 1:01:47| worked in this office and people would be amazed at the amount of work that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=3707)|
| 1:01:56| comes through there, and we we worked on just what we had to have to get by, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=3716)|
| 1:02:02| it was still everybody covered for everybody, and we all were cross-trained| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=3722)|
| 1:02:08| and the disbursements, and then, of course, doing all the fees to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=3728)|
| 1:02:13| sheriff's office and to the library and to the judges retirement and all that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=3733)|
| 1:02:16| A lot of people don't realize that that money gets paid out of that, so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=3736)|
| 1:02:21| that was a question I really just wanted to be made known to the public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=3741)|
| 1:02:26| and all that. It is what it is, and this pandemic has hit us all, and we are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=3746)|
| 1:02:35| just beginning to see the increase of COVID-19 in Knox County, and let me just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=3755)|
| 1:02:43| say we're in serious trouble right now with the health and all this COVID-19.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=3763)|
| 1:02:51| It's very serious in Knox County, so thank you, Charlie. I just really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=3771)|
| 1:02:56| wanted to make it known publicly that you have to keep that much in your bank| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=3776)|
| 1:03:03| account at all times, three months, and we have to have these employees, so thank| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=3783)|
| 1:03:10| you. All right, thank you, Commissioner Carringer. Commissioner Jay. Thank you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=3790)|
| 1:03:14| Mr. Chairman. Mr. Caldwell, you mentioned a loan. At some point, we've made a loan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=3794)|
| 1:03:21| to CAC. Have there other been other loans similar to that? I know I mentioned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=3801)|
| 1:03:25| last week we also made a loan, short-term loan to the, well, not a short-term loan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=3805)|
| 1:03:29| to the Zoo Knoxville. Are there other departments within, that you can take up off the top of your head?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=3809)|
| 1:03:36| We did a loan to CAC for the roof repair to the Mobile Mills kitchen, which I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=3816)|
| 1:03:43| think is repaid in two years, and then we did an advance on cash,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=3823)|
| 1:03:51| that made eight or ten years ago, for three million dollars, and so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=3831)|
| 1:04:00| that's the two, and those are in our annual report that we report every year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=3840)|
| 1:04:05| and talk about. Did we put an interest rate on any of those? Yes, there's an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=3845)|
| 1:04:11| interest rate on both. Is it the same formula, or is it something entirely| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=3851)|
| 1:04:17| different? Perry, do you remember the formula for those?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=3857)|
| 1:04:24| I'm sorry. It's a flat rate. Okay. Do those have predetermined return| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=3864)|
| 1:04:34| agreements, or repayment agreements, before they figured out what the amount| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=3874)|
| 1:04:37| was? The loan did, the advance does not. Okay. I guess one of the, we're on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=3877)|
| 1:04:43| substitute motion, I guess one of the, I feel like we're charging ourselves| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=3883)|
| 1:04:46| interest on this, and I can't quite, I understand that there's other uses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=3886)|
| 1:04:51| that you could put the money towards, I mean, you can put the money in overnight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=3891)|
| 1:04:54| rates and make more money on it, but you could make that argument for any number| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=3894)|
| 1:04:58| of cash flow or other departments with other things, and in this case, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=3898)|
| 1:05:03| don't forget that part of this is the juvenile court system. The rest of it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=3903)|
| 1:05:07| are, there's a lot of constitutional offices that fall under this entire| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=3907)|
| 1:05:12| operation. I know it's not, you know, particular to the funding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=3912)|
| 1:05:17| mechanism that we're talking about, but I just, I feel like we're charging| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=3917)|
| 1:05:20| ourselves interest on money that we're going to return. This office has returned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=3920)|
| 1:05:24| I think you said, forty or forty-five thousand dollars in the last couple| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=3924)|
| 1:05:28| years, so if there's a repayment, it's going to come from excess fees, so we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=3928)|
| 1:05:32| going to charge ourselves an interest rate on excess fees, otherwise, already| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=3932)|
| 1:05:36| being paid back. That's the part I just don't, I guess I'm confused as to why| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=3936)|
| 1:05:41| we do that. Why would we do that? All right, thank you, Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=3941)|
| 1:05:47| Moving down to Commissioner Boehler. I would understand that the juvenile system is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=3947)|
| 1:05:54| somewhat separate. Juvenile is in the budget, and it is, it's managed by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=3954)|
| 1:06:01| Charlie, but it's in the budget system. Does that answer your question? It is as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=3961)|
| 1:06:07| complicated as it sounds. I mean, it's, you know, juvenile court is here, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=3967)|
| 1:06:12| because a juvenile court, by and large, is not sustainable as a fee office because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=3972)|
| 1:06:17| you can't assess fees to minors, indigent folks, I think eighty to eighty-five| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=3977)|
| 1:06:22| percent of our dependence and neglect cases come from the state level. You| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=3982)|
| 1:06:25| can't charge the state and so forth, so that's, you know, yes, I'm over juvenile| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=3985)|
| 1:06:30| court. Juvenile court is funded by the county. And that's a lot of DCS| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=3990)|
| 1:06:35| placements, a lot of work. Yeah, I'm with you on that. I work in that field. It's a non-stop motion, and I just like to keep Judge Erwin happy, so the few conversations I have to have with him, the better off I am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=3995)|
| 1:06:46| He's big, so. All right, thank you. Moving on, Commissioner Boehler. Thank you, Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=4006)|
| 1:06:53| Chairman. You know, I don't think anybody up here likes the fact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=4013)|
| 1:07:00| that we're having to do this. However, a couple of things I wanted to say. Number| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=4020)|
| 1:07:07| one, I do want to commend Mr. Caldwell for going ahead and asking for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=4027)|
| 1:07:12| one and a half million to go to the well one time, so to speak, because we are in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=4032)|
| 1:07:16| unprecedented times, and we have no idea what other offices this could affect. And| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=4036)|
| 1:07:21| I say that because, you know, I'm a big believer in fee offices. I think fee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=4041)|
| 1:07:27| offices are the prime example of how government is occasionally allowed to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=4047)|
| 1:07:35| run like a business, and it has to run in the black in order to do that. And as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=4055)|
| 1:07:40| Mr. Susano has stated, the fee structure of this particular office is flawed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=4060)|
| 1:07:46| I mean, it's insufficient, and it needs to be addressed. But I don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=4066)|
| 1:07:52| think the alternative of converting this to a non-fee office and essentially| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=4072)|
| 1:07:57| putting it as a department, I don't think that's a viable option, because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=4077)|
| 1:08:02| that would violate the constitutional creation and intent behind this kind of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=4082)|
| 1:08:07| an office. And, you know, I do have confidence in the clerk. I mean, it's very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=4087)|
| 1:08:12| apparent to me that he knows his office well, he knows how it runs well, he knows| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=4092)|
| 1:08:15| what he's doing, and I think the people have entrusted him to do that, and I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=4095)|
| 1:08:19| trust him to do that. I do want to ask one question, though, Charlie, if you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=4099)|
| 1:08:24| don't mind. You alluded to this. Nobody mentioned this last week in the work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=4104)|
| 1:08:28| session, but you alluded to the fact that several years ago, the criminal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=4108)|
| 1:08:31| sessions, the criminal division sessions court was shifted from your office under| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=4111)|
| 1:08:36| another office. Do you know when that happened?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=4116)|
| 1:08:40| We spoke about it on the way over. I believe it was 2001. Does that sound| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=4120)|
| 1:08:46| about right, Randy? You've been around a long time, and no offense. What's that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=4126)|
| 1:08:54| Okay, okay. So, and I, you know, I will not disparage anybody who has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=4134)|
| 1:09:05| served Knoxville so well in public office, but I'll say it's presented some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=4145)|
| 1:09:10| challenges, but long before my time, and it, but, you know, we're here to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=4150)|
| 1:09:18| face challenges, you know, and we'll manage any which way we can. Maybe this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=4158)|
| 1:09:23| is a little more than you want. You know, I appreciate all of your questions. You| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=4163)|
| 1:09:28| know, these are hard answers. You know, Commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=4168)|
| 1:09:32| Schoonmaker, you probably forgot more about finance than I'll ever know, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=4172)|
| 1:09:36| these are good questions, I say to you, Commissioner Anders, as well. So we, you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=4176)|
| 1:09:40| know, there's a little bit of an unknown here, and I feel like this is the best| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=4180)|
| 1:09:44| way to prepare for that unknown, to be ready for what's coming, or what may not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=4184)|

| 1:09:58| We'll fulfill our obligation to Knox County. You know, we all have the same| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=4198)|
| 1:10:03| goals, which is to provide the public the best possible service we can. We get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=4203)|
| 1:10:06| there in different ways, but I share that goals with this body, and again, I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=4206)|
| 1:10:11| thank you for your questions. Thank you. I just wanted to make one other comment, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=4211)|
| 1:10:17| Thank you. I appreciate what you were saying there, Charlie. You know, regardless| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=4217)|
| 1:10:24| of when that happened, I guess in many ways it's water under the bridge. I don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=4224)|
| 1:10:28| want to get into the discussion of why or what needs to change, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=4228)|
| 1:10:32| there's no question that it shifted the balance of two fee offices in kind of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=4232)|
| 1:10:36| like this, and so it's become much more of a challenge to manage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=4236)|
| 1:10:42| the office that you hold, and so in times like this, I think these are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=4242)|
| 1:10:49| measures we need to take. It can be done. It's a thin margin, but it certainly can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=4249)|
| 1:10:52| be done in normal times, and it has been done. So, you know, I'm going to support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=4252)|
| 1:10:57| this. I do think that it is fair that general fund funds are not diminished in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=4257)|
| 1:11:07| any way, so I could support the overnight rate. Thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=4267)|
| 1:11:11| All right. Thank you. All right. You're not done yet. I know Commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=4271)|
| 1:11:15| Gill may have some more follow-up questions. Yes, ma'am. Thank you, Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=4275)|
| 1:11:20| Chairman. Thank you, Charlie, for you and your staff work, but this question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=4280)|
| 1:11:24| actually has Chris Caldwell. I just need to clarify something. Thank goodness. I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=4284)|
| 1:11:30| good. Thank you. I just wanted to know if this is the funding template if other fee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=4290)|
| 1:11:36| offices approach the Commission, and if this is the template we're going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=4296)|
| 1:11:42| follow, and if the federal COVID CARES dollars come to the county, what is the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=4302)|
| 1:11:48| process of our allocation for those, and how will we best deal with those? So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=4308)|
| 1:11:52| that's the point I needed to have some clarification on. So, if this is approved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=4312)|
| 1:11:58| this is the model. If any fee office came to us needing money, we would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=4318)|
| 1:12:03| follow this same model as we have now an avenue to work toward, work from,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=4323)|
| 1:12:08| and we would follow this same model. We have received CARES Act money. It| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=4328)|
| 1:12:19| cannot be used for revenue shortfall, so we couldn't use CARES Act money for his| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=4339)|
| 1:12:26| his shortfall. We have to tie it to an expense, and so, you know, you all have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=4346)|
| 1:12:33| approved CARES, what is known as CARES Act money, some from CDC, for the Health| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=4353)|

| 1:12:51| be receiving. We have an idea, and so, ultimately, though, they've got to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=4371)|
| 1:12:56| tied to expenses, not to revenue, so we'd have to, we have to work with him on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=4376)|
| 1:13:00| that. Thank you. All right. Thank you. All right. Seeing no other lights, I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=4380)|
| 1:13:06| sorry, Commissioner Biggs. Yeah. Given everything that we've heard tonight, is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=4386)|
| 1:13:10| there any way that we can note this for the Legislative Affairs Committee, so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=4390)|
| 1:13:16| that way that we might be able to talk to our state delegation about giving| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=4396)|
| 1:13:20| Mr. Susano some help, and even see the scope of work that it would take to get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=4400)|
| 1:13:24| that changed throughout the state of Tennessee? Just so, for future notes, I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=4404)|
| 1:13:29| mean. Or at least for some of the major metros. I'll look at Mr. Schoonmaker on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=4409)|
| 1:13:34| this one. If we could, we'll, when we transition with the new County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=4414)|
| 1:13:38| Commission body, that'll be a big focus, I know, as we gear up. You know, we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=4418)|
| 1:13:43| gonna, we shouldn't be meeting, that committee should not be meeting in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=4423)|
| 1:13:46| December. That meeting needs to start taking place in September and October to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=4426)|
| 1:13:49| gear up for next year. It's gonna be a big year. So, I'll look to Commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=4429)|
| 1:13:52| Schoonmaker to get that on the agenda. So, yes. Commissioner Smith. Thank you, Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=4432)|
| 1:13:57| Chair. Charlie, Randy, when this shift happened with responsibilities between| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=4437)|
| 1:14:04| the clerk's office, was that something that required state approval, or is it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=4444)|
| 1:14:09| something that we as a county can do? Shift that balance back? I do not have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=4449)|
| 1:14:15| that information, Commissioner. It's a good question. I do not know the answer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=4455)|
| 1:14:19| to that. I can get you the answer to that and be glad to, because I don't know what was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=4459)|
| 1:14:24| involved in that prior to. My understanding is that at one point, Fourth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=4464)|
| 1:14:30| Circuit was going to come under the umbrella of the circuit's office. That| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=4470)|
| 1:14:33| did not happen. So, I don't know the details of how that came about, and it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=4473)|
| 1:14:40| a good question. You know, we can get you an answer for that, though. There's a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=4480)|
| 1:14:44| balance there. We have some giving excess fees and then others struggling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=4484)|
| 1:14:49| If there was a way we could balance this, it might be good for all parties. And| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=4489)|
| 1:14:55| just a point of clarification that my Chief Deputy Randy Cantor told me, there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=4495)|
| 1:14:59| in fact was, in 2012, I believe there was a $2, what was a $2 tech fee increase| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=4499)|
| 1:15:05| across the state. So, we want to just make sure we're giving you accurate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=4505)|
| 1:15:10| information. So, apparently that was a in 2012 that took place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=4510)|
| 1:15:15| Thank you, sir. Obviously, some room for improvement, and hopefully we could get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=4515)|
| 1:15:21| get that on the radar of our Knox County delegation and look at the larger| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=4521)|
| 1:15:25| municipalities to see if that's something that, even if the smaller| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=4525)|
| 1:15:29| counties keep it one way, that could be something based on our volume that the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=4529)|
| 1:15:32| larger metro counties end up dealing with. So, we'll need to move on to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=4532)|
| 1:15:37| vote, but go ahead Commissioner Schoonmaker. Yeah, there's several issues that affect the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=4537)|
| 1:15:42| larger metropolitan areas where legislation may need to be based on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=4542)|
| 1:15:46| populations above 300,000. Yeah, and give other municipalities the option to opt| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=4546)|
| 1:15:52| in if something passes. So, all right, the motion that is on the floor was a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=4552)|
| 1:15:56| substitute motion that was made by Commissioner Schoonmaker and seconded by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=4556)|
| 1:16:00| Commissioner Anders. That motion included the Friendly Amendment from Commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=4560)|
| 1:16:04| Anders. It was in a roughly to utilize the current overnight lending rate that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=4564)|
| 1:16:12| we're receiving from the best rate available. I want to be clear, because at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=4572)|
| 1:16:16| this one final point of clarification for this, at present we have 1% from BB&T.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=4576)|
| 1:16:21| In six months, that could be different. So, the proper verbiage should likely be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=4581)|
| 1:16:28| whatever the our current best available overnight lending rate is that we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=4588)|
| 1:16:36| actually receiving. Is that proper terminology Mr. Caldwell? Okay, is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=4596)|
| 1:16:42| everybody clear on that with the modifications that I made around the at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=4602)|
| 1:16:47| that rate? So, all right, that's the motion that's before us. All in favor of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=4607)|
| 1:16:51| this motion, please say aye. It requires a roll call vote. Yeah, I'm sorry. Yeah, we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=4611)|

| 1:19:21| I think she talked about it a little bit at the work session. I was just curious as to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=4761)|
| 1:19:26| do these Airbnbs have to register? How do we know where they are? Are they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=4766)|

| 1:21:13| little bit of additional discussion on this one. Is there anybody from the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=4873)|
| 1:21:15| Merit Council or the Sheriff's Office here tonight?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=4875)|

| 1:21:33| reiterate from last week, to establish this timeframe will allow us to do the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=4893)|
| 1:21:38| eligibility testing, as in the physicals and the psychologicals, prior, I apologize,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=4898)|
| 1:21:43| after selection and completing those, as opposed to prior. Keeping the language as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=4903)|
| 1:21:49| is, according to the Law Director's Office, we would have to do that testing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=4909)|
| 1:21:54| prior to selection to be on the eligibility list. Over the last few| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=4914)|
| 1:21:59| years, by doing this after selection, has saved Knox County over $90,000 each year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=4919)|

| 1:22:20| approve, then Sir Spangler will get in touch with us. All right, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=4940)|
| 1:22:24| I'll just, a matter, a personal statement about the Merit Council. I've got a lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=4944)|
| 1:22:29| of friends who've served on it. I've known Jim, Jr. for a long time, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=4949)|
| 1:22:35| even knowing what they do, I'll be absolutely honest and say I had no idea| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=4955)|
| 1:22:40| that the Merit Council was involved on the front end of employment decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=4960)|
| 1:22:44| I'd always seen the Merit Council, really, I go back, when I was in my 20s, I had a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=4964)|
| 1:22:49| job. My first job was a union type of job, and we had shop steward that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=4969)|
| 1:22:55| whenever one of my friends or some dummy, somebody might get in trouble, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=4975)|
| 1:22:59| you're gonna get a reprimand or get fired, often the shop steward from the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=4979)|
| 1:23:02| union would step in to try to make sure that you're being treated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=4982)|
| 1:23:06| fairly. And, you know, that's everything that I've learned that is a big| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=4986)|
| 1:23:10| important role with the Merit Council, was to make sure that all of our sheriff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=4990)|
| 1:23:15| guys were being treated fairly, and we're not subject to any political whims| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=4995)|
| 1:23:19| over the years as different sheriffs come in. And so, this whole thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=4999)|
| 1:23:25| that's come up before us is very interesting, because I, frankly, I had no| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=5005)|
| 1:23:29| idea that, really, they're also involved on the front end of it. So, just sort of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=5009)|
| 1:23:35| sort of throwing that one out there. So, as we move forward over the next month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=5015)|
| 1:23:39| it's probably something that I know it could be an opportunity to learn a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=5019)|
| 1:23:42| little bit more. I looked at, I think we, the Commission, first enabled the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=5022)|
| 1:23:48| committee, I think it was around 1977, if that sounds about right, and it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=5028)|
| 1:23:53| really hasn't, I'm not aware if it's changed that much since then. So, in terms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=5033)|
| 1:23:57| of how it's run, or at least the language in the charter that birthed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=5037)|
| 1:24:01| it, so to speak. So, but I'll say, I do agree with my friend, Commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=5041)|
| 1:24:07| Daley, that it's probably the best interest to go ahead and pass it this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=5047)|
| 1:24:09| month. And then, if you all want to visit, learn a little bit more over the next| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=5049)|
| 1:24:13| month, that's probably a pretty good idea. So, that said, I believe we have the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=5053)|
| 1:24:20| motion is properly before us, and we can have, unless, is there anybody from the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=5060)|
| 1:24:25| Sheriff's Department that wanted to speak on this one right now, or we can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=5065)|
| 1:24:28| easily just pass it, and then let everybody meet later. So, okay, not seeing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=5068)|

| 1:44:04| So, before we have a motion on this item, I think the proper motion would be to modify it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=6244)|
| 1:44:10| as written to Senate Board with just Commissioner Carringer's name in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=6250)|

| 1:44:21| So, Commissioner Carringer, would you like to make that motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=6261)|
| 1:44:24| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=6264)|

| 1:45:41| Present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=6341)|
| 1:45:42| All right, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=6342)|
| 1:45:43| All right, Madam Clerk, would you read the first item into the record, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=6343)|
| 1:45:47| This is 5-F-20-RC, request of premise land company for rezoning from A agricultural to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=6347)|
| 1:45:55| PR plan residential up to 5 dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=6355)|
| 1:45:59| Property located 5913 West Emory Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=6359)|
| 1:46:02| Parcel ID 78038, part of Commission District 6.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=6362)|
| 1:46:10| All right, thank you, Madam Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=6370)|
| 1:46:11| Before I call on the Planning Commission staff to go over this one, I am going to call on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=6371)|
| 1:46:17| Daniel, the Law Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=6377)|
| 1:46:19| This is the item that, if you recall from last month's meeting, originally it was item| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=6379)|
| 1:46:24| 71, which we then moved up to the top of the agenda, which, for lack of a better legal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=6384)|
| 1:46:29| term, it was recommended that we do some housekeeping on the resolution from last month| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=6389)|
| 1:46:37| and have another vote on it because it was a negative motion last month that did not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=6397)|
| 1:46:42| pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=6402)|
| 1:46:42| So I am going to ask Mr. Sanders to lead off the discussion on this one, just to, for lack| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=6402)|
| 1:46:48| of a better word, Mr. Sanders, if you could tee this up briefly for the Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=6408)|
| 1:46:52| Sure, thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=6412)|
| 1:46:54| Last month, when you met and voted on this item, there was a motion, a second, and then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=6414)|
| 1:47:03| there weren't sufficient votes to pass the motion, and it was a motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=6423)|
| 1:47:08| And the Commission essentially treated that as a denial and moved on quickly to the next| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=6428)|
| 1:47:16| item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=6436)|
| 1:47:17| We've discussed that in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=6437)|
| 1:47:20| That's not a proper procedure because these applicants are entitled to have their application| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=6440)|
| 1:47:27| acted on by the Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=6447)|
| 1:47:29| And before the Commission acts, it has to have a motion, a second, and six votes in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=6449)|
| 1:47:36| favor of the motion to carry the motion and pass the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=6456)|
| 1:47:39| When a motion fails, for lack of a second or lack of a sufficient number of votes, the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=6459)|
| 1:47:45| motion fails, but the application remains before the Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=6465)|
| 1:47:50| And in a case where you have a motion to approve that fails, it's not really appropriate to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=6470)|
| 1:47:58| translate that into an outright denial because the Commission still has several options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=6478)|
| 1:48:03| It could approve it at a different density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=6483)|
| 1:48:08| It could make other modifications that don't substantially alter the application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=6488)|
| 1:48:17| It could even remand the request back to the Metropolitan Planning Commission for reconsideration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=6497)|
| 1:48:23| and another recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=6503)|
| 1:48:25| So, a lot of options still available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=6505)|
| 1:48:31| The important thing is that you have a motion, whether it's to approve or deny, a second,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=6511)|
| 1:48:38| and six votes in favor of the motion to act on the application and dispose of the application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=6518)|
| 1:48:44| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=6524)|
| 1:48:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=6525)|
| 1:48:48| Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=6528)|
| 1:48:49| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=6529)|
| 1:48:51| Daniel, I just have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=6531)|
| 1:48:53| Is this the same process that is used when an application goes before a Planning Commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=6533)|
| 1:49:00| When they take a vote on Planning Commission, is it treated the same way?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=6540)|
| 1:49:04| Because they're the governing body that comes before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=6544)|
| 1:49:08| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=6548)|
| 1:49:11| Yeah, when the Planning Commission makes a recommendation to the County Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=6551)|
| 1:49:18| the Planning Commission is the applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=6558)|
| 1:49:21| So, if an application goes to Planning Commission and it is voted 7-4, like this one was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=6561)|
| 1:49:33| then is it denied?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=6573)|
| 1:49:35| Or do they have to go through the same process of affirming a denial?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=6575)|
| 1:49:38| Like, do they have to say?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=6578)|
| 1:49:39| Is the vote you're talking about occurring at the Planning Commission or here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=6579)|
| 1:49:44| No, I'm just curious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=6584)|
| 1:49:44| So, like, just take a hypothetical application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=6584)|
| 1:49:48| A person puts in an application to Planning Commission and they go before Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=6588)|
| 1:49:52| Let's say that Planning Commission was four votes for, however many number they're, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=6592)|
| 1:49:58| just make up the numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=6598)|
| 1:50:00| But if they did not receive enough votes in Planning Commission, would that be a denial?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=6600)|
| 1:50:05| Or do they, does Planning Commission then have to do an affirmative vote like we're doing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=6605)|
| 1:50:13| Do they have to follow the same process?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=6613)|
| 1:50:15| I don't advise the Planning Commission, number one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=6615)|
| 1:50:18| And I am not intimately familiar with the voting procedures and the regulations that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=6618)|
| 1:50:22| apply specifically to the Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=6622)|
| 1:50:25| But it's, I don't want to belittle the Planning Commission stage, but one way or another,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=6625)|
| 1:50:32| an application for rezoning will come to the County Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=6632)|
| 1:50:36| If the Planning Commission approves it, it comes here before it's adopted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=6636)|
| 1:50:42| But if they don't approve it, it's denied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=6642)|
| 1:50:44| If they don't approve it, if they don't approve it, and somehow the votes aren't there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=6644)|
| 1:50:49| and they treat it as a denial, well, the application is denied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=6649)|
| 1:50:54| Well, the application is going to be appealed to the County Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=6654)|
| 1:50:58| The County Commission can overrule that decision, and it's not final until we...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=6658)|
| 1:51:03| Yeah, I guess I'm just asking if they have to go through the same affirmative voting as we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=6663)|
| 1:51:09| It's like a two-step process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=6669)|
| 1:51:10| I would, I would prefer, like I said, I'm not, I don't advise the Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=6670)|
| 1:51:14| I'm not familiar with their procedures to talk about them tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=6674)|
| 1:51:18| But I would prefer they do, because then you would know for sure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=6678)|
| 1:51:22| for at least six Planning Commission, or a sufficient number of Planning Commissioners that were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=6682)|
| 1:51:27| saying, here's our motion, here's what our recommendation is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=6687)|
| 1:51:31| If, like you say, there was an, there's an application that there's maybe a motion to approve,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=6691)|
| 1:51:39| just like happened last month here, and that didn't receive a sufficient number of votes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=6699)|
| 1:51:43| you, you really wouldn't know if the Commissioners that voted against the motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=6703)|
| 1:51:50| wouldn't have made some, some different recommendation if they follow that procedure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=6710)|
| 1:51:54| But that's, but you don't know if they do or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=6714)|
| 1:51:57| That, right, that's what I'm saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=6717)|
| 1:51:58| There's not, there's not clarity in that procedure, and there's not certainty in that procedure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=6718)|
| 1:52:02| Okay, could I ask Planning staff if they could offer some,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=6722)|
| 1:52:05| I'm just wondering if we're kind of held to the same legal process as the people that send stuff to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=6725)|
| 1:52:13| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=6733)|
| 1:52:13| I'm Amy Brooks, Knoxville, Knox County Planning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=6733)|
| 1:52:16| I cannot speak to the entire history of the Planning Commission, but it is our general| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=6736)|
| 1:52:21| practice that they would follow the same procedure as what Mr. Sanders had laid out for you all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=6741)|
| 1:52:27| in terms of coming, coming to an affirmative vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=6747)|
| 1:52:31| Okay, thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=6751)|
| 1:52:32| Thank you for the clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=6752)|
| 1:52:34| All right, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=6754)|
| 1:52:35| All right, now, the Chair does recognize the Planning Commission staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=6755)|
| 1:52:40| If you could go ahead and provide a, a caption of this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=6760)|
| 1:52:43| Sure, so the Planning Commission recommended approving PR plan residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=6763)|
| 1:52:50| up to four dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=6770)|
| 1:52:56| Okay, all right, before I look for a motion on this one, I do, and y'all are in the back row,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=6776)|
| 1:53:03| but I believe I see the applicant present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=6783)|
| 1:53:05| Okay, is there any opposition here tonight to this particular one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=6785)|
| 1:53:13| Okay, all right, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=6793)|
| 1:53:16| All right, I do, the Chair recognizes we've got opposition in the back left corner and a few| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=6796)|
| 1:53:20| interspersed through here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=6800)|
| 1:53:23| Really, what I'd like to do is, I'll state a couple of motion opportunities here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=6803)|
| 1:53:28| We did discuss the pros and cons of this one extensively at the original meeting last month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=6808)|
| 1:53:34| and, you know, just as a matter of me personally speaking, more so out of my personal opinion than| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=6814)|
| 1:53:41| just as Chair, I felt like it was deeply debated last month, and I'm seeing this month's meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=6821)|
| 1:53:47| as more of a opportunity to correct based on what Law Director Sanders had said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=6827)|
| 1:53:54| So, if, you know, you could, Commissioner Anders could make a motion similar to what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=6834)|
| 1:54:00| he made last month, and you could have another vote to see if that, you know, fails again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=6840)|
| 1:54:05| or if you want to have a, meet the same standard, a motion that could be made properly would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=6845)|
| 1:54:11| to make a motion for denial of the request, and if that motion for denial passes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=6851)|
| 1:54:19| then effectively it has been denied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=6859)|
| 1:54:23| Is that, am I being clear, Mr. Sanders?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=6863)|
| 1:54:26| So, and then after that, would the, what options would the applicant have if that particular motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=6866)|
| 1:54:34| is denied?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=6874)|
| 1:54:37| They could, they'll have to go back through the process with the Planning Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=6877)|
| 1:54:43| or appeal to the Circuit Court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=6883)|
| 1:54:47| Okay, all right, thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=6887)|
| 1:54:51| Okay, is there any motion on this one to, yes, go ahead, is that Commissioner Smith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=6891)|
| 1:54:57| Yes, thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=6897)|
| 1:55:00| I think the, in the fairness of an open meeting, in the fairness of an open meeting, I think we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=6900)|
| 1:55:07| should let both the applicant and the opposition have five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=6907)|
| 1:55:12| Okay, is that the will of the body?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=6912)|
| 1:55:14| All right, we'll, I'll go ahead and grant the applicant five minutes and the opposition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=6914)|
| 1:55:19| five minutes to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=6919)|
| 1:55:20| It, my eyesight isn't that great, but I can see both the applicant and opposition with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=6920)|
| 1:55:25| paperwork in their hands, so I'm guessing they're both going to want to speak to this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=6925)|
| 1:55:28| and then we'll, it, if necessary, there could be a couple of questions, but I do want to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=6928)|
| 1:55:34| I don't want to drone on this one too long, so the applicant can go first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=6934)|
| 1:55:49| Good evening, Josh Sanderson, 4909 Ball Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=6949)|
| 1:55:52| If it's okay, can I defer to the opposition so I can go ahead and hear their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=6952)|
| 1:55:56| arguments and case points?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=6956)|
| 1:55:59| Sure, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=6959)|
| 1:56:02| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=6962)|
| 1:56:03| Is the opposition present?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=6963)|
| 1:56:05| I think I see you right back there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=6965)|
| 1:56:06| Sir, if you could go ahead and approach them, state your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=6966)|
| 1:56:16| My name is Byron Starkweather.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=6976)|
| 1:56:17| I reside at 7424 Northampton Boulevard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=6977)|
| 1:56:21| Our home is directly adjacent to the- Speak up, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=6981)|
| 1:56:25| Just lean, or pull the microphone, you can pull the microphone a little bit forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=6985)|
| 1:56:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=6987)|
| 1:56:28| My family and I reside directly adjacent to the property that is up for rezoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=6988)|
| 1:56:34| and we are opposed to the rezoning for a handful of reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=6994)|
| 1:56:38| First of all is the safety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=6998)|
| 1:56:40| We don't have sidewalks in our neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=7000)|
| 1:56:42| It's a small neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=7002)|
| 1:56:44| It comprises 40 homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=7004)|
| 1:56:45| It's been a stable neighborhood since about 1970.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=7005)|
| 1:56:49| There's an expectation about the quality of life and an expectation about the amount of noise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=7009)|
| 1:56:56| and traffic that comes through our neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=7016)|
| 1:56:58| My children use the streets for exercise, as do my wife and I.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=7018)|
| 1:57:02| Several of our neighbors are using these streets to walk their dogs and get exercise as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=7022)|
| 1:57:08| Another major concern of ours is the neighborhood pool that's at the corner of Patriot Way and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=7028)|
| 1:57:12| Northampton Boulevard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=7032)|
| 1:57:14| This pool serves several families with small children who park along the side of the road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=7034)|
| 1:57:20| and they've been doing this for years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=7040)|
| 1:57:22| In fact, when I left this evening to come here, there were about five cars parked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=7042)|
| 1:57:26| Well, we have a normal residential street, and this residential street then would serve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=7046)|
| 1:57:32| not just the 40 homes that are in our community, but the additional 96 homes that the developer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=7052)|
| 1:57:37| is planning to put on the property adjacent to us and tie into Patriot Way as entrance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=7057)|
| 1:57:44| and exit to that neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=7064)|
| 1:57:48| A third issue that we're concerned about is the traffic at the Carroll, Emory Road, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=7068)|
| 1:57:53| Carpenter Road exchange.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=7073)|
| 1:57:56| There have been several wrecks over the years at this particular intersection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=7076)|
| 1:58:00| It's a very busy intersection, and even getting out of our neighborhood in the morning is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=7080)|
| 1:58:05| a challenge because of the traffic at this intersection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=7085)|
| 1:58:07| I know that there's been discussion about putting a light at that intersection, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=7087)|
| 1:58:12| we haven't seen any signs of construction that begin, and so we're not sure if a light| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=7092)|
| 1:58:17| is going to be placed there or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=7097)|
| 1:58:20| So, the bottom line is we're opposed to it because of the adverse effects that this development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=7100)|
| 1:58:27| would have on our quality of life in the Northampton Commons subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=7107)|
| 1:58:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=7111)|
| 1:58:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=7112)|
| 1:58:33| All right, you've got a few minutes left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=7113)|
| 1:58:34| Is there anybody else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=7114)|
| 1:58:35| Go ahead and stop the clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=7115)|
| 1:58:37| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=7117)|
| 1:58:37| Please approach the podium and state your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=7117)|

| 1:58:55| is, and our road, our neighbors are going to be also affected by this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=7135)|
| 1:59:03| I know we talked at length last month, and I'll try to make it really quick because I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=7143)|
| 1:59:07| under the pressure of the time clock, but anyway, we did do some research.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=7147)|
| 1:59:11| We sent a report to every member here, and I'll just give you some quick facts out of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=7151)|
| 1:59:17| that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=7157)|
| 1:59:18| Since 1990, there have been 6,660 homes that have been built just in the Carnes area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=7158)|
| 1:59:28| You all have a list of those and also aerial photos of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=7168)|
| 1:59:31| We have talked about the traffic, which is still consistently an issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=7171)|
| 1:59:35| Adding these numbers of cars coming in and out of this new proposed neighborhood will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=7175)|
| 1:59:42| be exponentially worse than what we already have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=7182)|
| 1:59:46| Carpenter Road, Emory, Northampton, and Harrell Road are 0.2 miles from each other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=7186)|
| 1:59:56| All those entrances are, so we compile another mess of traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=7196)|
| 2:00:02| Harrell Road is a main connector to Oak Ridge Highway, coming out of Carpenter, going across| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=7202)|
| 2:00:10| Emory, trying to get across, and then going over to Harrell, and then going to Oak Ridge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=7210)|
| 2:00:14| Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=7214)|
| 2:00:15| A lot of people use that, especially during school hours and business, trying to get to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=7215)|
| 2:00:20| and from work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=7220)|
| 2:00:22| We took measurements of Carpenter Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=7222)|
| 2:00:24| That is also in your report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=7224)|
| 2:00:30| Carnes is not against progress.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=7230)|
| 2:00:34| Carnes is against the amount of development that has occurred and is coming up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=7234)|
| 2:00:41| There are several NPC meetings where new neighborhoods are being planned as we speak| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=7241)|
| 2:00:46| for those meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=7246)|
| 2:00:48| So, to say that, I held a petition drive just to kind of see what the community wanted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=7248)|
| 2:00:55| I have almost 800 online and signed in-person petitions, and I will, if y'all want those,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=7255)|
| 2:01:03| I'll be more than happy to give those to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=7263)|
| 2:01:06| I will add this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=7266)|
| 2:01:08| Everybody's familiar with Farragut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=7268)|
| 2:01:10| We are, let me get the numbers here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=7270)|
| 2:01:17| Our population, as of the report that I got, was 4,736 people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=7277)|
| 2:01:24| The size of Farragut, no, I'm sorry, were 4,736 people less than Farragut itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=7284)|
| 2:01:33| The square miles-| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=7293)|
| 2:01:34| Sam, I'm going to give you one more minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=7294)|
| 2:01:36| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=7296)|
| 2:01:37| I appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=7297)|
| 2:01:38| The square miles of Farragut versus Carnes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=7298)|
| 2:01:40| Carnes is 5.39 miles smaller than Farragut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=7300)|
| 2:01:46| And the housing units are only 1,800 less in Farragut than there is in Carnes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=7306)|
| 2:01:58| And you think of the size of Farragut versus the size of Carnes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=7318)|
| 2:02:02| That's pretty significant numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=7322)|
| 2:02:04| I guess, in closing, I'm a registered nurse, and I think about all these new homes that are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=7324)|
| 2:02:10| being built.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=7330)|
| 2:02:10| I have an elderly mother who's had a stroke, who has all kinds of medical issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=7330)|
| 2:02:15| These homes that are being built right now will not serve that population.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=7335)|
| 2:02:20| These are strictly starter homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=7340)|
| 2:02:24| Elderly people cannot get up and down the steps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=7344)|
| 2:02:26| They have issues, strokes, durable medical equipment, all kinds of issues that they're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=7346)|
| 2:02:32| just not going to be able to use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=7352)|
| 2:02:34| So, in saying that, just a minute, I've got to catch my breath.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=7354)|
| 2:02:43| And I worked in the OR, so I should be used to a mask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=7363)|
| 2:02:45| Keep the mask on, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=7365)|
| 2:02:46| In saying that, we have a population in Carnes that is aging, and we need to also think about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=7366)|
| 2:02:53| them and about what quality of life they're going to have in the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=7373)|
| 2:02:58| So, I appreciate your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=7378)|
| 2:03:00| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=7380)|
| 2:03:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=7381)|
| 2:03:02| Commissioner Anders has a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=7382)|
| 2:03:03| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=7383)|
| 2:03:04| Before you step away, I've got a question about the report that you guys sent us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=7384)|
| 2:03:07| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=7387)|
| 2:03:09| Very extensive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=7389)|
| 2:03:10| Very well done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=7390)|
| 2:03:11| But I think part of this discussion, and I don't disagree with you, Carnes, and we can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=7391)|
| 2:03:17| go to Gibbs, and we can go to Powell, there's insufficient, there's deficient roads all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=7397)|
| 2:03:23| over the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=7403)|
| 2:03:25| But the report lists several homes, Bakertown Road, Pleasant Ridge Road, Amherst.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=7405)|
| 2:03:32| There's several, Ellesmere Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=7412)|
| 2:03:36| So, to get that 6,000 number, we went way out here, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=7416)|
| 2:03:40| Which is fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=7420)|
| 2:03:41| I get it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=7421)|
| 2:03:42| Because that, some of that determines, you know, ball camp sometimes determines Carnes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=7422)|
| 2:03:46| traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=7426)|
| 2:03:46| And that's inclusive with our Carnes area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=7426)|
| 2:03:48| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=7428)|
| 2:03:48| But we failed to mention in the traffic enhancements that we've had, we failed to mention the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=7428)|
| 2:03:53| largest county project ever that we voted on the last two months, and also the red light| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=7433)|
| 2:04:01| at the realignment at Carpenter, about Chaud Road from Lovell all the way to Clinton Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=7441)|
| 2:04:07| I mean, that will alleviate a ton of traffic based on, if we're going to use these houses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=7447)|
| 2:04:13| over here on ball camp, we need to talk about the projects that we put on ball camp.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=7453)|
| 2:04:18| And, and I think that the, we just voted in the last budget, and I believe we're starting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=7458)|
| 2:04:23| to, in regards to realigning Harrell Road and Carpenter Road, we just voted a million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=7463)|
| 2:04:32| dollars to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=7472)|
| 2:04:33| And so that is, and actually the state had put that project off a year ago, and I asked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=7473)|
| 2:04:41| the mayor if he would graciously include that in this next budget, not because of this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=7481)|
| 2:04:45| development or any other development, but because it was needed 10 years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=7485)|
| 2:04:50| And so it's been put off by the state, but we, we spent a million dollars to pick that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=7490)|
| 2:04:56| back up this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=7496)|
| 2:04:57| And so, although this report has a ton of great facts in it, it eliminates about $55| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=7497)|
| 2:05:03| million worth of spending in roads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=7503)|
| 2:05:05| If you're going to use ball camp, it eliminates $55 million in infrastructure spending that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=7505)|
| 2:05:10| we, that we have voted for in the last 18 months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=7510)|
| 2:05:14| And so I think that's important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=7514)|
| 2:05:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=7515)|
| 2:05:16| Can I, can I speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=7516)|
| 2:05:18| Yeah, absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=7518)|
| 2:05:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=7518)|
| 2:05:19| Um, I know last month we had, again, that huge discussion, Mr. Snowden was here, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=7519)|
| 2:05:24| from that information that was spoken about, Mr. Snowden, I'm certainly not putting words| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=7524)|
| 2:05:30| in your mouth, but having taken notes, that project was not going to be started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=7530)|
| 2:05:35| The state was out of money, and the county was out of money too, so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=7535)|
| 2:05:40| We voted, we voted it in the last budget in June, or this last month, and, and I believe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=7540)|
| 2:05:44| uh, Jim, I don't want to put words in Jim's mouth either, I believe we're starting the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=7544)|
| 2:05:48| permit, or the engineering discussion with it right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=7548)|
| 2:05:51| So it's moving forward, hopefully in the last, next 18 to 24 months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=7551)|
| 2:05:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=7555)|
| 2:05:55| Should be on, on the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=7555)|
| 2:05:57| Well, I guess my question would be then, what do we do in 24 months when we take this neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=7557)|
| 2:06:01| and it's not constructed, and it's in the process of being constructed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=7561)|
| 2:06:05| What do we do with the amount of cars that are accessing that now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=7565)|
| 2:06:10| Well, um.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=7570)|
| 2:06:11| That's just a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=7571)|
| 2:06:12| Well, I'm, I'm not following that red light.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=7572)|
| 2:06:15| I mean.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=7575)|
| 2:06:16| But it's going to take a while to do it, but if they go ahead and start and get approved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=7576)|
| 2:06:20| then we've taken already those numbers, put them on that intersection, then we've got a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=7580)|
| 2:06:26| construction area on top of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=7586)|
| 2:06:28| So it's like I said, Karnes is not against Smithville at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=7588)|
| 2:06:32| I mean, we're not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=7592)|
| 2:06:32| We've got other developers at, there as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=7592)|
| 2:06:36| We just want our community fixed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=7596)|
| 2:06:39| I don't, hey, every argument you've made is plausible, and every concern that everybody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=7599)|
| 2:06:44| has is plausible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=7604)|
| 2:06:46| But, and I've, and I've tried to have, and I've had conversations with several people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=7606)|
| 2:06:50| in regards, you know, when, when Patriot Way was developed, it says, you know, for future| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=7610)|
| 2:06:57| development at the end of the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=7617)|
| 2:07:00| We did that with Golden Meadows and Hidden Meadows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=7620)|
| 2:07:04| We've done that off North Shore Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=7624)|
| 2:07:05| We've done that in several locations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=7625)|
| 2:07:07| Gibbs is having a discussion about apartments in the back of a subdivision right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=7627)|
| 2:07:13| But that planning choice was made, and I don't know why it took 50 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=7633)|
| 2:07:16| But that road was, I mean, and I think it'd be better as a subdivision for it to come| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=7636)|
| 2:07:20| off Emory Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=7640)|
| 2:07:21| I really do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=7641)|
| 2:07:22| It would make more sense to have an entry on Emory and possibly enhance Patriot Way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=7642)|
| 2:07:27| to have everybody to have multiple safety exits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=7647)|
| 2:07:31| But the report was very factual, very clean, a lot of great stuff in there, but it failed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=7651)|
| 2:07:38| to mention about $55 million worth of projects that we've put in this district in the last| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=7658)|
| 2:07:43| 18 months, and I think it's important to include that in the discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=7663)|
| 2:07:46| And I can't say that I disagree with you, and that's a very valid point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=7666)|
| 2:07:51| So I know that there's another gentleman right here, Mr. Frazier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=7671)|
| 2:07:54| He spoke last month, and he would like to, if allowed, to have a few moments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=7674)|
| 2:07:59| Yeah, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=7679)|
| 2:07:59| Just a few moments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=7679)|
| 2:08:00| I do want to be fair to the applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=7680)|
| 2:08:03| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=7683)|
| 2:08:05| Go ahead, Mr. Frazier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=7685)|
| 2:08:06| Thank you so much for indulging me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=7686)|
| 2:08:08| My name is Kenneth Frazier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=7688)|
| 2:08:10| I live at 6111 Patriot Way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=7690)|
| 2:08:14| Mr. Andrews, what you just said about the $55 million that we put into the Chaud Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=7694)|
| 2:08:23| expansion, and we see that that will be utilized with, right now there's an ongoing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=7703)|
| 2:08:29| development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=7709)|
| 2:08:30| I guess it's a commercial development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=7710)|
| 2:08:31| I think a new food city is going to go in over there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=7711)|
| 2:08:34| Am I correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=7714)|
| 2:08:34| That's already been improved, but yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=7714)|
| 2:08:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=7717)|
| 2:08:37| This is new money on top of that, but go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=7717)|
| 2:08:40| Exactly, exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=7720)|
| 2:08:42| So in order to have that kind of development be progress, we had to expand Oak Ridge Highway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=7722)|
| 2:08:49| and Chaud Road and improve that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=7729)|
| 2:08:51| What we're looking at is Blacksberry Road, Yonk Road, Carpenter Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=7731)|
| 2:08:56| These roads have been around for more than 50 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=7736)|
| 2:08:59| They have not been improved, and they cannot take the additional downward pressure as far| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=7739)|
| 2:09:08| as the developments that are being put on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=7748)|
| 2:09:11| So it's kind of like gaining 20 pounds, but expecting to fit in the same pair of pants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=7751)|
| 2:09:16| You're going to be busting at the seams, and the busting at the seams is, we have more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=7756)|
| 2:09:22| wrecks, we lose quality of life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=7762)|
| 2:09:27| These things are existential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=7767)|
| 2:09:30| I do believe that it is very easy to see if you just come out and take a look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=7770)|
| 2:09:35| We do need the improvements prior to the development so that we can have true progress.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=7775)|
| 2:09:39| That's all we're saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=7779)|
| 2:09:40| And Mr. Fridge, I don't disagree, but I think to include Amherst Road in this discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=7780)|
| 2:09:47| without including Chaud Road in the discussion is unfair to the county commission who has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=7787)|
| 2:09:52| saw fit to appropriate that amount of money and see how important it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=7792)|
| 2:09:56| I just, I don't disagree with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=7796)|
| 2:09:58| I live on an insufficient road, and I have friends that live just over the county line| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=7798)|
| 2:10:04| of Anderson County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=7804)|
| 2:10:05| I don't disagree with you 100% at all, but I think that the argument for, I mean, this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=7805)|
| 2:10:13| discussion and this report, which again, a ton of facts, really well put together,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=7813)|
| 2:10:22| but if we're going to include Amherst Road and Bakertown, then we need to acknowledge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=7822)|
| 2:10:27| $55 million worth of spending on that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=7827)|
| 2:10:29| Without a doubt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=7829)|
| 2:10:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=7830)|
| 2:10:32| Thanks, Mr. Frazier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=7832)|
| 2:10:35| Chair recognizes the applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=7835)|
| 2:10:37| And I think that's about seven minutes approximately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=7837)|
| 2:10:40| That seems like he spoke for a little more than a minute, and then we extended it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=7840)|
| 2:10:43| Okay, I won't need that long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=7843)|
| 2:10:45| Josh Sanderson, 4909 Ball Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=7845)|
| 2:10:49| I know we talked a lot last month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=7849)|
| 2:10:51| I know we all had a lot of great points, and the opposition always makes great points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=7851)|
| 2:10:56| But again, tonight, we're here for zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=7856)|
| 2:10:58| I'm a landowner, 5913 West Emery Road, and I have rights just like every other landowner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=7858)|
| 2:11:04| in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=7864)|
| 2:11:06| I don't have to get a traffic study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=7866)|
| 2:11:07| I don't have to get an engineer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=7867)|
| 2:11:09| I don't have to do stormwater.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=7869)|
| 2:11:10| I don't have to call the schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=7870)|
| 2:11:11| As a landowner, I don't have to go knock on my neighbor's door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=7871)|
| 2:11:16| That's this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=7876)|
| 2:11:17| As a developer, when I get a chance to meet with the engineers, when I get a chance to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=7877)|
| 2:11:22| meet with traffic study, when I get a chance to meet with the professionals, the educated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=7882)|
| 2:11:28| the people with 10 degrees, when I get to sit down in a room with them and they tell| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=7888)|
| 2:11:32| us what we can and can't do, that's the next step.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=7892)|
| 2:11:34| And the opposition will have a chance to come into the next meeting, which will be held| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=7894)|
| 2:11:38| right here, and see our layout and see what we plan on and see why it's going to better| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=7898)|
| 2:11:44| the community or why they think it's not going to better the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=7904)|
| 2:11:46| But tonight, I know there's concerns about traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=7906)|
| 2:11:49| I know there's concerns about roads, but we're here for zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=7909)|
| 2:11:52| MPC recommended this for four units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=7912)|
| 2:11:55| It was voted on 11 to 1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=7915)|
| 2:11:58| I'm here tonight for this commission to zone this appropriately with MPC recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=7918)|
| 2:12:05| And if a motion for less than four units an acre is made, I would like the record to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=7925)|
| 2:12:11| reflected of why that motion would make less than 40 units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=7931)|
| 2:12:16| And I will yield the rest of my time for comments and questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=7936)|
| 2:12:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=7939)|
| 2:12:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=7940)|
| 2:12:20| Commissioner Anderson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=7940)|
| 2:12:22| Before you sit down too far, I'm not going to ask you a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=7942)|
| 2:12:24| I'll talk to Jim Snowden if he don't mind to come up and talk about the post.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=7944)|
| 2:12:30| I know Josh just said talk about the zoning, but I want to talk about the process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=7950)|
| 2:12:34| of so there's a development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=7954)|
| 2:12:37| Jim, there's a development on, I believe, Carpenter Road, half a mile up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=7957)|
| 2:12:41| And the developer, the owner of that property has said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=7961)|
| 2:12:45| before they develop, they got to make Carpenter County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=7965)|
| 2:12:49| regulation up to their property, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=7969)|
| 2:12:51| Up to their entrance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=7971)|
| 2:12:53| I think Scott, Mr. Davis had that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=7973)|
| 2:12:56| And so if TDOT does not approve and all this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=7976)|
| 2:13:03| do you, is there room to work with the developer on the safety of the surrounding area?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=7983)|
| 2:13:09| Is that part of the requirements?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=7989)|
| 2:13:11| I mean, I know we can't make them do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=7991)|
| 2:13:12| Kate Road, I mean, they joined in and did Kate Road and Emory on their last development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=7992)|
| 2:13:19| They did behind the middle school, they rebuilt the road over there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=7999)|
| 2:13:27| Were those requirements of the developer at that time for that development?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=8007)|
| 2:13:30| Both of those developments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=8010)|
| 2:13:32| Yeah, those were improvements identified in the traffic study| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=8012)|
| 2:13:35| that was completed by the traffic engineer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=8015)|
| 2:13:37| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=8017)|
| 2:13:38| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=8018)|
| 2:13:39| I'm done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=8019)|
| 2:13:41| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=8021)|
| 2:13:42| Thank you, Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=8022)|
| 2:13:43| Mr. Snowden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=8023)|
| 2:13:45| Thank you, Mr. Jim.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=8025)|
| 2:13:48| Is there, is Mr. Snowden, sorry, first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=8028)|
| 2:13:53| Sorry, that's close.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=8033)|
| 2:13:54| Sorry about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=8034)|
| 2:13:55| Closer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=8035)|
| 2:13:57| Are there any improvements to Carpenter Road planned or in any phase in what any iteration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=8037)|
| 2:14:05| whatsoever?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=8045)|
| 2:14:07| There is the development that Commissioner Anders referenced that is pending another| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=8047)|
| 2:14:13| developer that's further to the north.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=8053)|
| 2:14:15| And then obviously some of the comments referenced in regard to the state project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=8055)|
| 2:14:20| that will go back probably four or five hundred feet and align a horizontal curve on Carpenter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=8060)|
| 2:14:28| as part of that project that the county has money in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=8068)|
| 2:14:31| So they are those two projects that are out there in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=8071)|
| 2:14:35| But the only one that's in process is the light realignment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=8075)|
| 2:14:40| Correct, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=8080)|
| 2:14:41| And is that, what phases, what process is that in right now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=8081)|
| 2:14:46| The design plans for the right-of-way are very close to completion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=8086)|
| 2:14:52| And now that this body has granted us that million dollars, we are to start the acquisition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=8092)|
| 2:14:59| process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=8099)|
| 2:15:00| So in the next few months, Knox County will begin the appraisal process of those properties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=8100)|
| 2:15:06| which includes a business and a commercial and a residential relocation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=8106)|
| 2:15:12| And realistically, when is the, what, what is the best case scenario for when that entire| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=8112)|
| 2:15:18| construction project would be done?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=8118)|
| 2:15:20| Just based on your knowledge of how TDOT works and these similar projects?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=8120)|
| 2:15:24| I would think that it could probably get started for construction next summer and probably,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=8124)|
| 2:15:32| you know, around eight to twelve months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=8132)|
| 2:15:34| So I would think worst case, you know, a realistic time frame would be two years from today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=8134)|
| 2:15:39| So two years would be realistic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=8139)|
| 2:15:41| And if any other delays happen, it could be more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=8141)|
| 2:15:43| But it's certainly not going to get any faster than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=8143)|
| 2:15:46| That would be a reasonable guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=8146)|
| 2:15:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=8147)|
| 2:15:47| Thank you, Mr. Snowden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=8147)|
| 2:15:48| If I could keep the mic, Mr. Sanderson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=8148)|
| 2:15:52| I think when we, when we talked about this last week in much detail,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=8152)|
| 2:16:12| everybody on this body is aware of the process and how we start, go from one to the other and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=8172)|
| 2:16:16| how we go through planning and then it comes to commission and all the different routes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=8176)|
| 2:16:21| But I think time and again, we've had the same discussion, which has happened in other zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=8181)|
| 2:16:28| issues, which is when everything works great, it's great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=8188)|
| 2:16:31| It's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=8191)|
| 2:16:32| We understand the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=8192)|
| 2:16:33| We understand zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=8193)|
| 2:16:34| We understand plan and concept use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=8194)|
| 2:16:36| But every once in a while, you know, we come up against a project that some element of that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=8196)|
| 2:16:42| doesn't seem to work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=8202)|
| 2:16:42| And a lot of times it comes down to public safety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=8202)|
| 2:16:45| And I know we've been through other zoning issues on this body where we've said, look,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=8205)|
| 2:16:49| this is just a bad piece of land or it's in a wrong hard spot or it's around a corner or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=8209)|
| 2:16:53| something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=8213)|
| 2:16:54| Sometimes there is something that mitigates that it doesn't just go according to process like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=8214)|
| 2:16:59| you laid out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=8219)|
| 2:17:00| And I think this is one of those issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=8220)|
| 2:17:02| We talked extensively about how we access this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=8222)|
| 2:17:07| And last week, you know, one of my biggest concerns, and I went back out there again| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=8227)|
| 2:17:13| this week for I think about the third time and drove around, is Carpenter Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=8233)|
| 2:17:18| And I drive a pickup truck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=8238)|
| 2:17:20| And when I get to that second corner on Carpenter Road, there's about a foot on each side| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=8240)|
| 2:17:25| before you're in a ditch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=8245)|
| 2:17:26| And based upon everything that we can see in this report that I can see is all the traffic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=8246)|
| 2:17:34| from this 96 home development is either going to come out onto Carpenter Road or onto North| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=8254)|
| 2:17:39| Hampton because there's been no, our own planning engineering team has said they don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=8259)|
| 2:17:47| they don't believe that TDOT would give access to West Emory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=8267)|
| 2:17:52| And I've asked offline, have you talked to TDOT?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=8272)|
| 2:17:56| And you've said no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=8276)|
| 2:17:58| You know, that seems to be the biggest issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=8278)|
| 2:18:00| So when you have a major safety issue, literally right at the bottom of the funnel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=8280)|
| 2:18:05| that's an issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=8285)|
| 2:18:06| And so I guess I was a little concerned when, you know, I asked as we've been here for a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=8286)|
| 2:18:11| month as a concept.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=8291)|
| 2:18:13| I know the concept plan doesn't come to LATO, but has a traffic study of any kind been done?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=8293)|
| 2:18:18| And the answer was no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=8298)|
| 2:18:19| Has any discussion with TDOT about would they give you access to West Emory?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=8299)|
| 2:18:25| And that hasn't been done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=8305)|
| 2:18:26| So the funnel still exists.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=8306)|
| 2:18:28| The safety issue still exists, in my opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=8308)|
| 2:18:31| And I think that's the issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=8311)|
| 2:18:32| So there's times where we get to a point where we're like, you know, everybody understands| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=8312)|
| 2:18:38| it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=8318)|
| 2:18:38| Even the opposition understands land is going to be developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=8318)|
| 2:18:41| But there are circumstances where when you're putting public safety at risk, it's not always| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=8321)|
| 2:18:47| appropriate at the right timing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=8327)|
| 2:18:48| So has any other discussion happened with TDOT?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=8328)|
| 2:18:51| Has any other discussion happened about West Emory?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=8331)|
| 2:18:55| My conversation is with you, but I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=8335)|
| 2:18:59| Rocky Smith, 49 Ball Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=8339)|
| 2:19:05| We have a property that is 20 something acres, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=8345)|
| 2:19:09| 24, approximately going to be 90 something units there, Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=8349)|
| 2:19:19| We have access.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=8359)|
| 2:19:21| I've never had a property that has access to the main collector, access to an adjoining| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=8361)|
| 2:19:27| subdivision, and access to Blacks Ferry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=8367)|
| 2:19:32| And we're being quizzed and questioned about all these accesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=8372)|
| 2:19:37| And I sat and watched back the replays of this last meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=8377)|
| 2:19:42| And two meetings, two properties after us, there was, I mean, MPC recommended two and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=8382)|
| 2:19:53| a half units per acre for Mrs. Rollins' property down in Hardin Valley, which has one access.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=8393)|
| 2:20:01| It can have two if it has a bridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=8401)|
| 2:20:03| And you all took the recommendation that not only go two and a half, to add another 125| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=8403)|
| 2:20:10| housing units to a property, and never questioned traffic studies on a 750 lot development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=8410)|
| 2:20:18| never questioned what their access was, and they had max two entrances and exits, which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=8418)|
| 2:20:25| I've always thought, you can't do over 350 homes on two exits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=8425)|
| 2:20:30| You can't do over 350 homes on two exits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=8430)|
| 2:20:34| This is 80 something lots, 90 something lots, and we're on a major collector.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=8434)|
| 2:20:42| We're on a connector to another subdivision, which you all, the county commission, the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=8442)|
| 2:20:47| planning, everyone makes us put in, which is the purpose of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=8447)|
| 2:20:51| And all we're talking about is Carpenter Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=8451)|
| 2:20:54| And when I looked at this development, I never even thought about Carpenter Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=8454)|
| 2:20:58| I never even put one thought into Carpenter Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=8458)|
| 2:20:59| Why would anybody go to Carpenter Road?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=8459)|
| 2:21:02| Not only the connecting subdivision, it has a boulevard entrance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=8462)|
| 2:21:07| Which in the planning, and that's why the professionals said four units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=8467)|
| 2:21:14| We're requesting four units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=8474)|
| 2:21:15| With all due respect, sir, it's because our planning department, our engineering department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=8475)|
| 2:21:19| said you wouldn't have access to Blacks Ferry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=8479)|
| 2:21:21| There's no way they would grant that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=8481)|
| 2:21:22| We don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=8482)|
| 2:21:24| They, in their opinion, this is-| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=8484)|
| 2:21:25| Why did you-| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=8485)|
| 2:21:27| Excuse me, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=8487)|
| 2:21:28| Let me finish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=8488)|
| 2:21:29| I gave you the respect to let you finish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=8489)|
| 2:21:31| Let me just have a conversation here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=8491)|
| 2:21:32| The reason we're not talking about Emory or Blacks Ferry is because our professional in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=8492)|
| 2:21:38| planning and engineering said there's no way they would give access to Blacks Ferry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=8498)|
| 2:21:42| It's too dangerous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=8502)|
| 2:21:43| They also gave us the opinion that they didn't believe that TDOT would give access directly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=8503)|
| 2:21:48| to West Emory because of the intersection and the blind curve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=8508)|
| 2:21:52| Therefore, in the opinion of our experts in engineering, they said the only viable way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=8512)|
| 2:21:59| to get out is one exit, which is Patriot Way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=8519)|
| 2:22:04| By default, I drove it 48 hours ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=8524)|
| 2:22:07| If you come out of there, you only have two choices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=8527)|
| 2:22:10| You have go down to Northampton's Common or you have straight ahead to Carpenter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=8530)|
| 2:22:14| Now, if there's a brand new light at Carpenter and you've got to go out of that division,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=8534)|
| 2:22:21| I'm going to go to the light because it's easier to turn than to play Frogger across| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=8541)|
| 2:22:25| West Emory with all the traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=8545)|
| 2:22:27| Then Carpenter does become the issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=8547)|
| 2:22:30| Right now, you can barely fit one pickup truck on Carpenter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=8550)|
| 2:22:33| Even with the new light, that doesn't go up to the point where Carpenter becomes an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=8553)|
| 2:22:37| old country road and it's dependent upon another division.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=8557)|
| 2:22:43| The reason this is an issue and it's not the same as every other land use that we've ever| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=8563)|
| 2:22:48| approved is because to me, it's a public safety issue where everything funnels out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=8568)|
| 2:22:53| into one really bad spot with a bad turn lane or a bad traffic access onto West Emory and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=8573)|
| 2:23:00| a Carpenter road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=8580)|
| 2:23:01| I think that's why this is different than every other development you've brought us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=8581)|
| 2:23:05| for at least the last two years I've been here has gone through without a pass, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=8585)|
| 2:23:09| everything's not the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=8589)|
| 2:23:11| Commissioner, the professionals probably took that in consideration and instead of giving| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=8591)|
| 2:23:17| us five, gave us four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=8597)|
| 2:23:20| But why would you all on the rolling piece increase that count when the professionals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=8600)|
| 2:23:26| looked at the traffic, looked at all the access and they got two accesses and you all had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=8606)|
| 2:23:32| no discussion of increasing it 125 units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=8612)|
| 2:23:38| What study did you do about that to increase that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=8618)|
| 2:23:41| Well, I'm not talking about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=8621)|
| 2:23:43| I'm talking about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=8623)|
| 2:23:43| That happened at the last meeting right after we got turned down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=8623)|
| 2:23:46| But wait a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=8626)|
| 2:23:47| This is where I'm just a little confused.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=8627)|
| 2:23:49| Everybody on this stage understands the need for development and the need for more growth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=8629)|
| 2:23:55| People in this community even understand the need for more growth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=8635)|
| 2:23:58| But you all are a sophisticated company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=8638)|
| 2:24:01| You've been here a long time and you build a lot of stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=8641)|
| 2:24:04| So in a month, there are ways to try to fix and find solutions and everybody wants to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=8644)|
| 2:24:09| find a solution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=8649)|
| 2:24:11| The community is not under the assumption this will never be developed and this commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=8651)|
| 2:24:16| understands development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=8656)|
| 2:24:17| But in a month, nothing has been done to show a concept plan, which you guys do all the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=8657)|
| 2:24:22| time and I would really, really question if you look at a piece of land and don't have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=8662)|
| 2:24:26| some idea of what you might want to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=8666)|
| 2:24:27| I know it's not required.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=8667)|
| 2:24:29| I know a traffic study isn't required.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=8669)|
| 2:24:31| But we're talking about an expense of $5,000 to $10,000 to do a traffic study that could| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=8671)|
| 2:24:36| have been done by this point to say here's some solutions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=8676)|
| 2:24:40| There's a hundred things that could have been done in the last 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=8680)|
| 2:24:44| We don't know there's a problem yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=8684)|
| 2:24:45| How do we even know what the solution is when we don't know if there's a problem yet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=8685)|
| 2:24:49| That will be handled at the next phase and they say, guys, you've got to do this, this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=8689)|
| 2:24:52| and this to have these four units of acre or we're going to give you this many.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=8692)|
| 2:24:55| That happens all the time to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=8695)|
| 2:24:57| That's the next step.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=8697)|
| 2:24:59| I hope you all can vote for us for four units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=8699)|
| 2:25:02| I apologize if I got a little angry, but I just, we've got three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=8702)|
| 2:25:07| I've never had a property with this much access for a few units and so many options to get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=8707)|
| 2:25:12| traffic out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=8712)|
| 2:25:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=8713)|
| 2:25:14| I've got another speaker who wants to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=8714)|
| 2:25:16| Mr. J's light is on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=8716)|
| 2:25:18| Thank you for your passion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=8718)|
| 2:25:19| Mr. Fraser.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=8719)|
| 2:25:24| Thank you again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=8724)|
| 2:25:25| I'll just be just a moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=8725)|
| 2:25:28| I think the issue is that, how many units did you say that you were going to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=8728)|
| 2:25:35| Ninety-something, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=8735)|
| 2:25:36| Ninety-something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=8736)|
| 2:25:37| Don't worry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=8737)|
| 2:25:37| If we get four units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=8737)|
| 2:25:38| Eighty-four?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=8738)|
| 2:25:39| Ninety-three?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=8739)|
| 2:25:41| Whatever the, I don't know, whatever the four times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=8741)|
| 2:25:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=8745)|
| 2:25:46| Let's just say 90 units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=8746)|
| 2:25:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=8748)|
| 2:25:49| What we are forgetting are the units already in existence for 50 years in the North Hampton| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=8749)|
| 2:25:56| Commons subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=8756)|
| 2:25:58| We are being forgotten.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=8758)|
| 2:26:00| So if you're going to bring, what they're trying to do is they're trying to access| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=8760)|
| 2:26:04| Patriot Way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=8764)|
| 2:26:05| That is a community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=8765)|
| 2:26:09| That never meant, it was never meant to have that kind of traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=8769)|
| 2:26:14| We're bearing a complete, another whole community on a road that was only meant to bear| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=8774)|
| 2:26:21| 40 houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=8781)|
| 2:26:23| So please don't forget about us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=8783)|
| 2:26:26| We don't mind development as long as the development is progress.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=8786)|
| 2:26:32| If there's so much access, then you guys don't need Patriot Way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=8792)|
| 2:26:37| You have Blacksberry and you have Emory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=8797)|
| 2:26:40| If you can't get it done with those two, I say let's wait until we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=8800)|
| 2:26:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=8804)|
| 2:26:45| Thank you, Mr. Frazier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=8805)|
| 2:26:46| The chair is going to recognize, we've got Commissioner Gill and Commissioner Bussler| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=8806)|
| 2:26:50| have, both have got questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=8810)|
| 2:26:52| Commissioner Gill, you're recognized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=8812)|
| 2:26:53| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=8813)|
| 2:26:55| The gentleman just said exactly what needed to be said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=8815)|
| 2:26:58| It is the access that is not needed on Patriot Way and the level of opposition here because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=8818)|
| 2:27:04| they do not want that street to be the primary road to access this development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=8824)|
| 2:27:15| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=8835)|
| 2:27:15| Thank you, Commissioner Gill, Commissioner Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=8835)|
| 2:27:19| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=8839)|
| 2:27:21| Mr. Smith, I got to ask you a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=8841)|
| 2:27:26| You've done a lot of development in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=8846)|
| 2:27:29| Have you ever gone to one of your properties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=8849)|
| 2:27:32| and you got it rezoned and the professionals came in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=8852)|
| 2:27:37| Have they ever told you, you can't do it this way, you got to do it some other way?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=8857)|
| 2:27:41| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=8861)|
| 2:27:43| After you got the zoning?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=8863)|
| 2:27:44| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=8864)|
| 2:27:45| And they took in consideration safety, they took in consideration of access| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=8865)|
| 2:27:50| and probably utilities and things of that sort, probably, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=8870)|
| 2:27:53| There's many processes that we go through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=8873)|
| 2:27:56| But as the professionals will tell you exactly what you can and cannot do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=8876)|
| 2:28:02| you can't tell them what you're going to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=8882)|
| 2:28:03| They will tell you what you have to do, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=8883)|
| 2:28:06| They're trained and that's why we hire them and use them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=8886)|
| 2:28:09| and that's why the county hires them and uses them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=8889)|
| 2:28:11| They may come in and say you can't get four units an acre, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=8891)|
| 2:28:15| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=8895)|
| 2:28:16| They may say you have to do this, this and this before you could even start, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=8896)|
| 2:28:20| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=8900)|
| 2:28:21| Okay, Mr. Snowden, can I ask you a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=8901)|
| 2:28:27| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=8907)|
| 2:28:31| We, Mr. Snowden, we rely on professionals to tell us what we can and cannot do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=8911)|
| 2:28:37| If they say, Mr. Smith, you cannot do this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=8917)|
| 2:28:41| you cannot access that, that's a dangerous street, you can't access it, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=8921)|
| 2:28:46| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=8926)|
| 2:28:47| My staff and the professionals on my staff would never allow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=8927)|
| 2:28:50| any development to do anything unsafe to the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=8930)|
| 2:28:53| So you would hold his feet to the fire, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=8933)|
| 2:28:55| That's correct, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=8935)|
| 2:28:56| And it has to do with safety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=8936)|
| 2:28:58| But as of right now, all we've got before us is zoning, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=8938)|
| 2:29:03| That is correct, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=8943)|
| 2:29:04| We get to this next step, it's going to tell him what he can and cannot do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=8944)|
| 2:29:08| And what we're at is a rezoning phase right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=8948)|
| 2:29:11| And I think that's what we need to work on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=8951)|
| 2:29:15| and let the professionals decide what else could be done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=8955)|
| 2:29:18| and cannot do on that piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=8958)|
| 2:29:20| And that's just my opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=8960)|
| 2:29:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=8961)|
| 2:29:24| All right, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=8964)|
| 2:29:25| My opinion on this one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=8965)|
| 2:29:28| I'm going to look to Commissioner Biggs, you don't have a light back there, but I was checking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=8968)|
| 2:29:34| I guess my issue is this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=8974)|
| 2:29:36| Last month, under the advice of our friend, the law director,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=8976)|
| 2:29:41| he said, you guys need to bring this back up to curate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=8981)|
| 2:29:44| to make sure that we have a proper motion and vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=8984)|
| 2:29:47| And I said before, this body, while I realize as chair,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=8987)|
| 2:29:51| to a large extent, I am working for the body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=8991)|
| 2:29:54| And it was the, I believe my read of the room is everyone did want to hear,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=8994)|
| 2:29:59| you know, more information on this one, and I'll let it happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=8999)|
| 2:30:02| However, I also believe that the intent of the body| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=9002)|
| 2:30:06| was fairly clear last month with the vote that happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=9006)|
| 2:30:09| And guess what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=9009)|
| 2:30:10| I was one of the ones that voted in favor of this particular development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=9010)|
| 2:30:14| However, I also respect the fact that that was not how it went through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=9014)|
| 2:30:20| And I never looked at this hearing tonight as an opportunity to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=9020)|
| 2:30:24| excuse the cliche, to get another bite at the apple.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=9024)|
| 2:30:28| So I want to be clear, I will be voting against it tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=9028)|
| 2:30:32| because the intent on that this session is not a second appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=9032)|
| 2:30:39| This is a opportunity to curate based on what the advice was from the law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=9039)|
| 2:30:47| That, hey, that's Hugh Nystrom's opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=9047)|
| 2:30:50| And I'm just, I'm speaking just as a commissioner from the fourth district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=9050)|
| 2:30:54| not as the chair, but that is where I stand on this particular matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=9054)|
| 2:30:58| And if our friends dismiss, if they choose to appeal this to the court, that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=9058)|
| 2:31:02| I don't even know what will pass, but I'm just making it very clear my intent on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=9062)|
| 2:31:07| I voted last week in favor, excuse me, last month because I did want to see a plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=9067)|
| 2:31:13| but I respect the process and I am going to be voting against it this month| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=9073)|
| 2:31:18| merely because of what we stated at last month's meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=9078)|
| 2:31:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=9082)|
| 2:31:23| So that said, I can make a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=9083)|
| 2:31:27| The proper, I'm going to look back to the law director on this one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=9087)|
| 2:31:30| but a motion that could be made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=9090)|
| 2:31:32| And as chair, I'll make this motion just to get the vote going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=9092)|
| 2:31:36| And then if we need to do something else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=9096)|
| 2:31:39| But the issue was last time we voted, it was voted to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=9099)|
| 2:31:44| The vote that did not, was not, did not pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=9104)|
| 2:31:49| So if we want to get a flip that would be the second follow-up motion would be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=9109)|
| 2:31:54| the motion would be to deny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=9114)|
| 2:31:56| And if the positive motion to deny passes, then that has accomplished what the intent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=9116)|
| 2:32:02| of the vote at last month's meeting was by the voters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=9122)|
| 2:32:06| And I look to the law director to either nod or tell me I'm an idiot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=9126)|
| 2:32:14| I did not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=9134)|
| 2:32:16| You don't have to tell me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=9136)|
| 2:32:17| I've never used the word cure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=9137)|
| 2:32:18| Yeah, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=9138)|
| 2:32:20| Unless you're talking about hams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=9140)|
| 2:32:22| This matter of business is still before the county commission and it can do whatever it will,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=9142)|
| 2:32:27| as long as you get a motion to second and six votes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=9147)|
| 2:32:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=9151)|
| 2:32:31| I'll make a motion to deny this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=9151)|
| 2:32:33| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=9153)|
| 2:32:34| There's a second from Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=9154)|
| 2:32:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=9156)|
| 2:32:37| The motion that's been made by Commissioner Nystrom and seconded by Commissioner Jay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=9157)|
| 2:32:41| is to deny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=9161)|
| 2:32:42| All in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=9162)|
| 2:32:44| All opposed, please say nay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=9164)|
| 2:32:46| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=9166)|
| 2:32:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=9167)|
| 2:32:48| Roll call vote, Madam Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=9168)|
| 2:32:52| And we'll be starting with Commissioner Carringer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=9172)|
| 2:32:55| So if you vote yes, I'll just have to restate this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=9175)|
| 2:32:59| If you're voting yes, you're voting to deny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=9179)|
| 2:33:01| So okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=9181)|

| 2:35:25| And is the applicant present?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=9325)|
| 2:35:27| All right, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=9327)|
| 2:35:28| And is there any opposition present?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=9328)|
| 2:35:32| Okay, what I'd like to do is, first of all, I never| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=9332)|
| 2:35:38| assume everybody's got, this has two particular motions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=9338)|
| 2:35:41| If you guys have been following this one closely, I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=9341)|
| 2:35:44| see a whole lot of folks are in opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=9344)|
| 2:35:45| I know the last group had kind of been through it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=9345)|
| 2:35:47| So there's a vote for a sector amendment change, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=9347)|
| 2:35:50| then there's an actual vote for zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=9350)|
| 2:35:53| This first vote is related to the sector plan change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=9353)|
| 2:35:57| However, as we always do on these things, probably| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=9357)|
| 2:35:59| everything will probably end up getting put on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=9359)|
| 2:36:01| table during the first vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=9361)|
| 2:36:03| So what I'd like to do is ask the applicant to step| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=9363)|
| 2:36:07| forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=9367)|
| 2:36:08| I'm going to give the applicant five minutes, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=9368)|
| 2:36:10| then I'll allow the opposition to speak for five| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=9370)|
| 2:36:13| minutes, and then we'll begin debate on this matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=9373)|
| 2:36:16| Can I have a point of order, Mr. Chairman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=9376)|
| 2:36:18| When was the sector plan last approved on this one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=9378)|
| 2:36:24| 2016, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=9384)|

| 2:36:40| opposition to state the case first, if you don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=9400)|
| 2:36:42| mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=9402)|

| 2:36:52| time, I would like you to go ahead and present it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=9412)|
| 2:36:54| first this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=9414)|
| 2:36:55| So go ahead, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=9415)|
| 2:36:57| Well, I really don't know what they're opposing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=9417)|
| 2:37:00| sir, because I had a meeting with the neighbors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=9420)|
| 2:37:05| on Wednesday this week, and we discussed what the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=9425)|
| 2:37:09| concerns were.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=9429)|
| 2:37:11| And I told them what I was planning on doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=9431)|
| 2:37:16| They told me what their concerns were, and I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=9436)|
| 2:37:20| that I answered the questions and told them what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=9440)|
| 2:37:24| I was going to do in order to have them accept| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=9444)|
| 2:37:30| this change in zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=9450)|
| 2:37:33| And I had their approval at that time and their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=9453)|
| 2:37:38| support, and I just now find out that they have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=9458)|
| 2:37:43| changed their mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=9463)|
| 2:37:44| So I really don't know why they have changed their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=9464)|
| 2:37:46| mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=9466)|
| 2:37:47| I would like to hear what they have to say, if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=9467)|
| 2:37:48| you don't mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=9468)|
| 2:37:49| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=9469)|
| 2:37:49| So basically, your statement and the application| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=9469)|
| 2:37:52| speaks for itself, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=9472)|
| 2:37:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=9474)|
| 2:37:54| Excuse me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=9474)|
| 2:37:55| The application of what you've just said, I get it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=9475)|
| 2:37:57| And after they speak, we'll allow you to rebuttal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=9477)|
| 2:38:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=9480)|
| 2:38:00| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=9480)|
| 2:38:01| So if there's a spokesperson from the opposition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=9481)|
| 2:38:03| that spokesperson, I'll give you five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=9483)|
| 2:38:06| And if you could please state your name and address| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=9486)|
| 2:38:08| for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=9488)|
| 2:38:09| And if I can't hear, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=9489)|
| 2:38:10| I was going to say, pull the microphone forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=9490)|
| 2:38:13| My name is Ruth Ann Millsaps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=9493)|
| 2:38:15| I live at 9305 Dutchtown Road, Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=9495)|
| 2:38:19| Thank you all for your dedication and your hard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=9499)|
| 2:38:21| work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=9501)|
| 2:38:22| First of all, I'd like to say we did meet, three or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=9502)|
| 2:38:25| four of us did meet with him, and we did find| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=9505)|
| 2:38:27| exactly what he was planning and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=9507)|
| 2:38:30| And then we had to take it back to the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=9510)|
| 2:38:33| It was just a few of us that met with him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=9513)|
| 2:38:35| And there was not a consensus as to that we had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=9515)|
| 2:38:39| agreed or not agreed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=9519)|
| 2:38:40| We just looked at his plan to see that basically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=9520)|
| 2:38:44| the biggest thing that we had to do was take it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=9524)|
| 2:38:46| back to our neighborhood people and confer with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=9526)|
| 2:38:49| him, which we did do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=9529)|
| 2:38:51| And I would, I have a large amount of things to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=9531)|
| 2:38:54| say, but I'm not going to say all of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=9534)|
| 2:38:55| Most of you got my email, I hope, and it told you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=9535)|
| 2:38:59| a lot about the density and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=9539)|
| 2:39:02| I'm going to, you know, the property in question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=9542)|
| 2:39:04| is the two acre property on the corner of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=9544)|
| 2:39:06| Dutchtown and Bob Kirby Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=9546)|
| 2:39:08| The property is currently zoned neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=9548)|
| 2:39:10| commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=9550)|
| 2:39:12| The applicant has requested the property be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=9552)|
| 2:39:14| changed from neighborhood commercial zoning to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=9554)|
| 2:39:16| medium density residential zoning at a density| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=9556)|
| 2:39:20| of 12 units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=9560)|
| 2:39:22| If this change takes place, medium density would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=9562)|
| 2:39:24| allow 20 to 24 apartments to build on two acres| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=9564)|
| 2:39:29| of land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=9569)|
| 2:39:31| MPC meeting Commissioner Scott Smith mentioned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=9571)|
| 2:39:33| that the county growth and sector plan did not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=9573)|
| 2:39:35| call for this type of zoning and would have to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=9575)|
| 2:39:38| be changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=9578)|
| 2:39:39| He and five other commissioners voted against| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=9579)|
| 2:39:42| changing the sector plan and the zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=9582)|
| 2:39:44| There's multiple, multiple, which we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=9584)|
| 2:39:47| listed Nottingham Forest, Hampton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=9587)|
| 2:39:50| Everyone is in the neighborhood of four to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=9590)|
| 2:39:52| five to five units per the density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=9592)|
| 2:39:56| There are other residential properties that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=9596)|
| 2:39:58| are one and two up and down North Dutchtown| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=9598)|
| 2:40:02| Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=9602)|
| 2:40:02| So, but this area is primarily residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=9602)|
| 2:40:07| okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=9607)|
| 2:40:07| There's no need for us to have too much| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=9607)|
| 2:40:09| commercial and I agree with him that the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=9609)|
| 2:40:12| commercial process in this area doesn't need,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=9612)|
| 2:40:15| we don't need it because Dutch, Cedar Bluff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=9615)|
| 2:40:17| Road is like down the street right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=9617)|
| 2:40:20| And so we have all the commercial that basically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=9620)|
| 2:40:21| we do need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=9621)|
| 2:40:23| Residential is what it is primarily for all of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=9623)|
| 2:40:25| it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=9625)|
| 2:40:26| So the biggest thing I can say is if there's a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=9626)|
| 2:40:29| change from neighborhood commercial, I would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=9629)|
| 2:40:31| prefer it to be LDR.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=9631)|
| 2:40:34| This is more compatible with the existing land| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=9634)|
| 2:40:36| use on the north side of Dutchtown Road, west| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=9636)|
| 2:40:38| of Cedar Bluff Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=9638)|
| 2:40:40| I am opposed to MDR zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=9640)|
| 2:40:43| I would request that the zoning be LDR at five| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=9643)|
| 2:40:48| units per acre, which is more compatible to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=9648)|
| 2:40:50| surrounding neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=9650)|
| 2:40:52| If we go to medium density, this opens the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=9652)|
| 2:40:55| door for anybody anywhere in that area that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=9655)|
| 2:40:59| has an acre or two of ground to come in and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=9659)|
| 2:41:02| put a large amount of apartments on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=9662)|
| 2:41:04| And I just don't think that our community can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=9664)|
| 2:41:07| handle that type of growth in that matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=9667)|
| 2:41:10| We're not against him building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=9670)|
| 2:41:12| We just like the density changed and not so much| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=9672)|
| 2:41:16| instead of 10 units per acre, five units per| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=9676)|
| 2:41:21| acre would be more compatible and more better| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=9681)|
| 2:41:24| for the area of where we're at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=9684)|
| 2:41:26| And I'm going to yield to one of my others that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=9686)|
| 2:41:29| want to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=9689)|
| 2:41:32| And do you want to come forward?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=9692)|
| 2:41:34| My name is Stan Atkins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=9694)|
| 2:41:35| I'm at 1508 Scottsdale Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=9695)|
| 2:41:37| I represent Webb School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=9697)|
| 2:41:39| We're not opposed to good neighbors, and we like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=9699)|
| 2:41:42| land improvements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=9702)|
| 2:41:43| The number of units that is being requested, we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=9703)|
| 2:41:47| feel like it's going to add to the traffic that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=9707)|
| 2:41:49| already overloaded on Dutchtown as it comes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=9709)|
| 2:41:51| from west to east.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=9711)|
| 2:41:54| We have two schools on Dutchtown Road, one on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=9714)|
| 2:41:57| Cedar Bluff Road, one on Cedar Bluff Road, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=9717)|
| 2:42:00| one on Cedar Bluff Road east.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=9720)|
| 2:42:02| We have two schools within a mile there, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=9722)|
| 2:42:05| traffic is already a problem, and to add more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=9725)|
| 2:42:08| units to that would just add more hazards to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=9728)|
| 2:42:12| our students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=9732)|
| 2:42:13| And we have 1,000 students that come from that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=9733)|
| 2:42:15| exit every day, 180 adults, faculty, and staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=9735)|
| 2:42:19| that work there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=9739)|
| 2:42:20| So we're not opposed to good neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=9740)|
| 2:42:22| We like land improvements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=9742)|
| 2:42:25| But we are opposed to this amount, this change,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=9745)|
| 2:42:28| increasing the number of units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=9748)|
| 2:42:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=9750)|
| 2:42:32| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=9752)|
| 2:42:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=9753)|
