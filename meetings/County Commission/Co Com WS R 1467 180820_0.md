| 0:00:30| This August meeting of the Knox County Commission Work Session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=30)|
| 0:00:38| Commissioner Carrington, would you please lead us in the pledge?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=38)|
| 0:00:42| Yes, my pleasure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=42)|
| 0:00:44| Everyone stand please and salute our flag.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=44)|
| 0:00:50| I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the republic for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=50)|
| 0:01:13| Next on the agenda is public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=73)|
| 0:01:16| Mr. Herbert Monsier, would you like to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=76)|
| 0:01:20| I appreciate being up front.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=80)|
| 0:01:21| My name is Herbert Monsier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=81)|
| 0:01:23| My address is 550 West Main Street, Bank of America Center, Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=83)|
| 0:01:29| And you have up to five minutes to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=89)|
| 0:01:31| 9-1-0-2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=91)|
| 0:01:34| I represent somebody I think many of you probably know, Captain James Carson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=94)|
| 0:01:39| He is in charge of the court services of the city county building and all of the courts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=99)|
| 0:01:45| I believe also the security of the county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=105)|
| 0:01:49| You may not be aware or you may be aware that the Knox County Law Director Armstrong has recused himself in a lawsuit that has been brought for Knox County and you by a private law firm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=109)|
| 0:02:07| that is acting as the Knox County Law Director and is suing the Knox County Retirement Board and is suing all of the current and retired members of your uniformed services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=127)|
| 0:02:26| Previously, I believe in July, some retirees came before you and asked you to approve counsel for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=146)|
| 0:02:35| And it was the advice of your law director, Mr. Armstrong, who had recused himself, that the Knox County Charter did not provide for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=155)|
| 0:02:45| You voted five to five, as I recall, against approving the legal counsel for the retired officers and that they were not current employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=165)|
| 0:02:59| Now, I have filed today that is self-explanatory a detailed rendition of what has taken place for Captain Carson, who is a current employee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=179)|
| 0:03:15| and who has been sued by the Knox County to take away his benefits under the retirement plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=195)|
| 0:03:27| I state in that petition why it is that it is necessary for Captain Carson to be funded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=207)|
| 0:03:36| And the main reason is that Knox County is required through their private attorney to join in the lawsuit all people who have an interest,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=216)|
| 0:03:52| which is every employee of the Knox County Sheriff's Department and every retired employee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=232)|
| 0:04:03| And they are trying to do this through what's known as a class action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=243)|
| 0:04:08| That is that the court appoint a class to represent the sum 600 people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=248)|
| 0:04:17| There's just one problem, and that is none of these people have the financial ability to be able to mount a defense for 600 employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=257)|
| 0:04:32| through a class action to accommodate the private attorney and for you, Knox County, suing your employees in the Sheriff's Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=272)|
| 0:04:44| It's as simple as that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=284)|
| 0:04:48| So what we have done with the concurrence of Sheriff Jones and with the concurrence of incoming Sheriff Spangler,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=288)|
| 0:04:57| we've requested the law director pro tem. Pro tem means temporary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=297)|
| 0:05:02| A private attorney for members of his firms are being paid by the treasury of Knox County to sue 600 employees of your Sheriff's Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=302)|
| 0:05:17| It's as simple as that. You can't cut it any other way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=317)|
| 0:05:20| But more importantly, I want to throw this out, and I hadn't had a chance to talk to the law director about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=320)|
| 0:05:28| In my work on this matter, I also realized that if this private attorney prevails in denying these 600 members of your Uniformed Services benefits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=328)|
| 0:05:43| it's going to affect every single employee of Knox County that is a participant in a pension plan that has similar provisions as to the Uniformed Pension Services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=343)|
| 0:06:02| Now, I tell you that not to say that that is the case or that isn't the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=362)|
| 0:06:08| What I'm telling you that is that there is a mammoth, when I say mammoth, lawsuit that has been brought without your permission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=368)|
| 0:06:20| by your law director who has recused himself and a private law firm who is paying four attorneys out of your treasury to sue your employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=380)|
| 0:06:34| There's no other way to cut the dice, folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=394)|
| 0:06:38| Now, Captain Carson has stepped up to be what's known as a representative,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=398)|
| 0:06:44| that if you approve the funds for him and the attorneys necessary to provide full and adequate representation to 600 members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=404)|
| 0:06:59| with the potential that it could pour over to every single employee of Knox County in this massive litigation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=419)|
| 0:07:09| There are three attorneys that are currently representing retirees who you have denied legal assistance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=429)|
| 0:07:21| One of those attorneys is a renowned pension expert by the name of Al Holifield.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=441)|
| 0:07:28| The other attorney represents a widow of one of the retired members who is receiving the benefits and then myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=448)|
| 0:07:36| Three attorneys are asking that pursuant to the charter, you authorize Captain Carson as a current employee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=456)|
| 0:07:50| to hire the legal attorneys to be able to provide representation to the class to where Mr. Carson or Captain Carson would be the class representative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=470)|
| 0:08:03| In the long run, it's going to save you a lot of money to keep 600 different employees coming in and suing Knox County individually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=483)|
| 0:08:14| So it's to your benefit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=494)|
| 0:08:16| Now, I'm here today only for one reason, realizing this is a workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=496)|
| 0:08:22| And I'm here today only to alert you to the fact that I have filed these papers today to let you study them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=502)|
| 0:08:31| And I'm here today to offer myself and my telephone number to anybody that has any questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=511)|
| 0:08:38| because somehow I remember in the past that you all can't talk among yourselves about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=518)|
| 0:08:45| That was a joke, if you didn't get it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=525)|
| 0:08:48| Seriously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=528)|
| 0:08:50| I offer myself to discuss it with you anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=530)|
| 0:08:53| It's not a political issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=533)|
| 0:08:56| It's a legal issue as to someone, a private attorney, has taken upon itself to represent you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=536)|
| 0:09:08| I question that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=548)|
| 0:09:10| However, that's not the decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=550)|
| 0:09:12| But that private attorney has placed your employees in this county in a tremendously serious position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=552)|
| 0:09:23| And your employees in this county need to have the semblance or some semblance of equality in fighting this law firm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=563)|
| 0:09:35| and their four attorneys that you're paying for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=575)|
| 0:09:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=579)|
| 0:09:43| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=583)|
| 0:09:44| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=584)|
| 0:09:45| Mr. Monsir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=585)|
| 0:09:47| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=587)|
| 0:09:49| We got these pretty late this afternoon, Mr. Monsir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=589)|
| 0:09:52| What is the status of the motion to dismiss?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=592)|
| 0:09:55| Currently, on August the 1st, there was a meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=595)|
| 0:10:01| We sat down, and of course Law Director Armstrong was being consulted with what I call the attorney's pro tem,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=601)|
| 0:10:10| to apply or to create an expedited, that means quick, proceeding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=610)|
| 0:10:18| For some reason, and I'll never understand why they did it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=618)|
| 0:10:21| but the private attorneys are insisting that a motion to dismiss be heard before they are asking for the class certification to take place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=621)|
| 0:10:32| My position is that they're putting the cart before the horse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=632)|
| 0:10:36| The motion to dismiss is based upon the fact that the interested parties in this case,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=636)|
| 0:10:42| that is the 495 current employees plus the, I think the number is 145 retired employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=642)|
| 0:10:52| I might be off on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=652)|
| 0:10:53| Please don't hold me to that figure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=653)|
| 0:10:55| But they're asking for the class to be certified after the motion to dismiss.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=655)|
| 0:11:01| The motion to dismiss is based upon the fact that they haven't joined all of the parties that need to be before the court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=661)|
| 0:11:09| Now, why they're doing it that way, that's the way they're doing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=669)|
| 0:11:14| So the status to answer your question of the motion to dismiss is that it is set to be heard expeditiously on 9 o'clock a.m. on September the 7th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=674)|
| 0:11:25| and if time permitting after that, and if the court doesn't dismiss the case, then the court will take up the class certification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=685)|
| 0:11:32| But here's the problem with the class certification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=692)|
| 0:11:36| Assume that the court were to appoint one of these retirees and say you're going to be the class representative for all these people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=696)|
| 0:11:46| Where are they going to get the money to do it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=706)|
| 0:11:50| And the law is very clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=710)|
| 0:11:52| For a class representative to represent a class, that class representative must be able to fully and adequately represent the interest of the class.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=712)|
| 0:12:05| That can't happen until somebody finances it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=725)|
| 0:12:10| And the person that should finance this is the person that brought this mammoth lawsuit to begin with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=730)|
| 0:12:15| and asked for the class to be forced upon your employees, and that's not the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=735)|
| 0:12:21| And the charter provides you the authority to provide this current employee, current employee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=741)|
| 0:12:29| Counsel?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=749)|
| 0:12:31| So has the current employee been brought in already?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=751)|
| 0:12:34| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=754)|
| 0:12:35| The law, the private attorney has selectively brought in only retired employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=755)|
| 0:12:43| I think there's a total of nine of them at the present time, but they don't have any representation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=763)|
| 0:12:49| The law director has not brought in the people that are going to be affected by it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=769)|
| 0:12:54| and when I say the law director, I'm talking about the private attorney,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=774)|
| 0:12:57| and that's 486 employees and potentially every employee in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=777)|
| 0:13:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=783)|
| 0:13:04| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=784)|
| 0:13:05| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=785)|
| 0:13:07| I'll leave you all to work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=787)|
| 0:13:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=790)|
| 0:13:11| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=791)|
| 0:13:17| It's time to set the agenda and amendments to the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=797)|
| 0:13:22| I have two items to be added.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=802)|

| 0:21:40| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=1300)|
| 0:21:43| Mark Brown handled this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=1303)|
| 0:21:46| I'm not trying to blame him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=1306)|
| 0:21:47| I just don't know the answer to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=1307)|
| 0:21:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=1309)|
| 0:21:50| I didn't think you would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=1310)|
| 0:21:51| Chris, do you know?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=1311)|
| 0:21:53| Nobody from Procurement here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=1313)|
| 0:21:55| They're at a conference in Nashville, so if you'll just defer until Monday, then they'll be here then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=1315)|
| 0:22:00| Mr. Chairman, the law department worked on that contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=1320)|
| 0:22:03| There are no real problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=1323)|
| 0:22:05| The one that did that, there was an original problem because of the lease.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=1325)|
| 0:22:09| We've got everything worked out with the purchasing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=1329)|
| 0:22:13| The contract looks good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=1333)|
| 0:22:15| So insofar as I'm speaking for purchasing, we're on the same table on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=1335)|
| 0:22:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=1342)|
| 0:22:24| It's budgeted in the enterprise fund, so as far as budgeting, it's not an issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=1344)|
| 0:22:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=1351)|
| 0:22:32| So we have a motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=1352)|
| 0:22:34| Do you want to change it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=1354)|
| 0:22:35| Do you feel more comfortable changing it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=1355)|
| 0:22:36| No, I feel fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=1356)|
| 0:22:39| Well, I had my light on because I serve on Three Ridges Golf Board as well as Commissioner Bessler,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=1359)|
| 0:22:47| and as far as I know from our last board meeting, everything was good to go, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=1367)|
| 0:22:54| I just wanted to add that if that helps any.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=1374)|
| 0:22:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=1378)|
| 0:22:59| We have a motion to approve and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=1379)|
| 0:23:02| Any further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=1382)|
| 0:23:04| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=1384)|

| 0:23:06| Opposed say no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=1386)|
| 0:23:07| The motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=1387)|
| 0:23:10| Item number 43 is a resolution approving three offers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=1390)|
| 0:23:15| to acquire real property along Alcoa Highway from the Tennessee Department of Transportation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=1395)|

| 0:23:53| Commissioner Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=1433)|
| 0:23:54| I'd like to make a motion for no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=1434)|
| 0:23:57| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=1437)|
| 0:23:58| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=1438)|
| 0:23:59| The reason for this, Mr. Snowden and I met with PBA Parks and anybody else, Jim?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=1439)|
| 0:24:08| I can't remember.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=1448)|
| 0:24:09| Anyway, this piece of property is there at the I.C. King Park Alcoa Highway expansion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=1449)|
| 0:24:16| and we're wanting to look at maybe not closing both entrances there at northbound Alcoa Highway to I.C. King Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=1456)|
| 0:24:26| So there was a question brought up, and Mr. Snowden is going to clarify that, and we'll have an answer Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=1466)|
| 0:24:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=1473)|
| 0:24:35| Any further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=1475)|
| 0:24:38| The motion is to approve without recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=1478)|
| 0:24:41| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=1481)|

| 0:24:44| The motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=1484)|

| 0:25:07| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=1507)|
| 0:25:08| One of the items that I need to disclose is that I recommended is my husband works for the Knoxville Museum of Art| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=1508)|
| 0:25:15| and specifically to the program that is the Live After Five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=1515)|
| 0:25:19| I'm in support of what is being recommended, but I just need to make sure I make disclosure that he works for the KMA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=1519)|
| 0:25:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=1526)|
| 0:25:29| Commissioner Dowd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=1529)|
| 0:25:32| Commissioner Nystrom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=1532)|
| 0:25:34| I've just got a couple of questions for Mr. Caldwell about a couple of these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=1534)|
| 0:26:01| Can you hear me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=1561)|
| 0:26:02| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=1562)|
| 0:26:03| I leaned into the button and nuked it there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=1563)|
| 0:26:04| Sorry, everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=1564)|
| 0:26:06| Chris, there were just a couple of things on here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=1566)|
| 0:26:08| I know that, generally speaking, most of the appropriations on here are through defined service contracts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=1568)|
| 0:26:14| Some of these are more capital expenses that other Knox County partners that maybe they put their request in before the budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=1574)|
| 0:26:23| got initially declined and we were going to put it off until right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=1583)|
| 0:26:27| But there are a couple that the finance guy in me just had a question on, if you could please clarify.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=1587)|
| 0:26:36| Some of these are things that I would describe as things that you normally expense as part of an ongoing business cycle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=1596)|
| 0:26:44| There's an ongoing theme through here with multiple departments of AT&T billing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=1604)|
| 0:26:50| I think I know what that's related to, but if you could clarify that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=1610)|
| 0:26:55| And then I've got a couple of others just to ask for clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=1615)|
| 0:27:00| I think the public would want to know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=1620)|
| 0:27:02| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=1622)|
| 0:27:03| AT&T is fairly easy, although it's been difficult to resolve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=1623)|
| 0:27:06| It's an issue where they failed to bill us for about a year, and we've been working for about a year to get that cleaned up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=1626)|
| 0:27:14| and they still haven't got it rectified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=1634)|
| 0:27:17| Since we do not encumber funds for things like AT&T billings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=1637)|
| 0:27:22| we have to move the unspent budget over to the next year because we didn't get it rectified in fiscal year 18.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=1642)|
| 0:27:30| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=1650)|
| 0:27:31| So what you're saying is they didn't send us a bill this past year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=1651)|
| 0:27:35| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=1655)|
| 0:27:36| And now we've got to carry over money for this year's phone bill into next year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=1656)|
| 0:27:41| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=1661)|
| 0:27:42| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=1662)|
| 0:27:43| Cool.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=1663)|
| 0:27:44| The other one I noticed under parts and rec is we've got overtime, which is more of what I would describe as probably a labor cost,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=1664)|
| 0:27:51| and that's usually expensed on an ongoing basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=1671)|
| 0:27:55| If you could help just clarify what's going on with overtime winding up on this type of appropriation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=1675)|
| 0:28:01| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=1681)|
| 0:28:02| Happy to do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=1682)|
| 0:28:03| The previous director failed to ask for overtime during the budget process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=1683)|
| 0:28:09| and that was noticed after the budget got approved and they asked for funding for overtime.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=1689)|
| 0:28:14| So in order for them not to overspend their budget for 19,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=1694)|
| 0:28:19| we feel it's appropriate to estimate and appropriate additional funding for overtime that was not asked for in the budget process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=1699)|
| 0:28:27| That makes sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=1707)|
| 0:28:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=1708)|
| 0:28:29| I'm done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=1709)|
| 0:28:30| Commissioner Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=1710)|
| 0:28:31| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=1711)|
| 0:28:34| My favorite chief of the volunteer fire, Seymour Volunteer Fire Department is here, John Linson Bigler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=1714)|
| 0:28:40| And I'd like to thank Mr. Caldwell, the mayor, for giving us the $50,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=1720)|
| 0:28:47| And we're there in South Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=1727)|
| 0:28:50| We are growing, and not only growing business-wise, we're growing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=1730)|
| 0:28:55| We've got 100-unit apartment complexes coming into the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=1735)|
| 0:28:59| And the Seymour Volunteer Fire Department, they work hard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=1739)|
| 0:29:02| They're hardworking people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=1742)|
| 0:29:03| They're all volunteers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=1743)|
| 0:29:05| And we're trying, I don't know if you've been out at Chapman Highway, Station Number 2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=1745)|
| 0:29:10| We're trying, and hopefully everybody got the drawing, the picture of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=1750)|
| 0:29:13| We're trying to renovate that department out there, and it's going to be like a $225,000 project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=1753)|
| 0:29:22| Chief Linson Bigler has raised $119,000 of that, if I'm correct, Chief?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=1762)|
| 0:29:29| Yes, through grants as well, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=1769)|
| 0:29:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=1771)|
| 0:29:32| And thankfully for Knox County, we've got the $50,000 here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=1772)|
| 0:29:36| And I just wanted to introduce Chief if he wanted to come up and say just a few things about the fire department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=1776)|
| 0:29:42| If he can, if he wants to, if he don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=1782)|
| 0:29:44| Is that all right, Mr. Chair?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=1784)|
| 0:29:45| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=1785)|

| 0:30:19| So South Knoxville is kind of my love.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=1819)|
| 0:30:22| I was the president of the Seymour South Knox Chamber of Commerce for the past three years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=1822)|
| 0:30:29| Enjoyed businesses and in the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=1829)|
| 0:30:31| And it is growing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=1831)|
| 0:30:34| I think between Johnsonville Highway and the Knox Blount County, the Blount Severe County line, you will see continued growth in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=1834)|
| 0:30:42| You're at the foothills of the Great Smoky Mountain National Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=1842)|
| 0:30:46| It's a great place to live.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=1846)|
| 0:30:48| Growth of the call volume that we were starting to run in Knox County has continued to increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=1848)|
| 0:30:55| We have a FEMA grant from SAFER called Staffing Adequate Fire Resources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=1855)|
| 0:30:59| We've had that for several years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=1859)|
| 0:31:01| We got a request from them to move money over to do staffing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=1861)|
| 0:31:06| So right now we have a person on call at that South Knoxville station on Tipton Station Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=1866)|
| 0:31:11| And right now they're sleeping on a couch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=1871)|
| 0:31:13| Going this morning, you open the door, there they are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=1873)|
| 0:31:16| So we're trying to get them adequate quarters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=1876)|
| 0:31:19| Well, in order to do that, we need to build an expanding bay, 2200 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=1879)|
| 0:31:23| If you saw the information that was in front of you, we can remodel the existing bay using FEMA money that's already been appropriated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=1883)|
| 0:31:29| But that money will expire August, September of 2019.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=1889)|
| 0:31:35| So that's where we're needing the additional total of $125,000 from Knox County to knock this whole project out and get this project going and completed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=1895)|
| 0:31:43| Hopefully this time next year is my goal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=1903)|
| 0:31:46| We've never been in the 47 years of the fire department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=1906)|
| 0:31:50| I've never been before this county commission asking for money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=1910)|
| 0:31:53| This is our first asking for a one-time lump sum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=1913)|
| 0:31:56| We do get defined service money from that office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=1916)|
| 0:32:01| We've been getting that for the last several years, and that's continuing to help us to grow and respond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=1921)|
| 0:32:06| You have the details about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=1926)|
| 0:32:08| Anything else you'd like me to add?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=1928)|
| 0:32:10| No, I just wanted to say thank you for every police officer, fire department, rescue squad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=1930)|
| 0:32:17| I see the rescue squad here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=1937)|
| 0:32:19| You know, I had an accident.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=1939)|
| 0:32:21| I had an issue a couple weeks in my family, and when I dialed 911, I wanted somebody there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=1941)|
| 0:32:29| And you don't know what you need until you're in that need, and I was in that need a couple weeks ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=1949)|
| 0:32:37| And I want to personally thank each one of our first responders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=1957)|
| 0:32:42| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=1962)|
| 0:32:43| You're welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=1963)|
| 0:32:44| I don't know that they say think Seymour, you think strictly Seward County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=1964)|
| 0:32:47| but we do cover up all the way up to the IM's Nature Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=1967)|
| 0:32:49| Anything that wasn't finger annexed by Victor Asch, unless you go up Chapman Highway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=1969)|
| 0:32:53| it's kind of like city, county, city, county, city, county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=1973)|
| 0:32:56| So we travel all the way up there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=1976)|
| 0:32:57| This station is right at the five-mile mark, almost all the way up to Meade's Quarry,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=1977)|
| 0:33:02| and that gives that whole area community about a five ISO or public protection class,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=1982)|
| 0:33:08| which usually saves about four to six percent of their property insurance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=1988)|
| 0:33:11| depending on what insurance company they're carrying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=1991)|
| 0:33:14| That's all. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=1994)|
| 0:33:15| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=1995)|
| 0:33:16| Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=1996)|
| 0:33:17| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=1997)|
| 0:33:18| I just wanted a little bit of piggyback off of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=1998)|
| 0:33:20| I would also talk about the Carnes a lot in here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=2000)|
| 0:33:23| Carnes was not in the process for the defined.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=2003)|
| 0:33:26| The reason Carnes is in here is because they were in the transition of administration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=2006)|
| 0:33:30| when the defined services contract started,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=2010)|
| 0:33:32| and so Chris and the mayor have been gracious enough to allow Seymour and Carnes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=2012)|
| 0:33:37| to stay compatible in their numbers over the years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=2017)|
| 0:33:40| But on the rescue squad side, I think the chairman of the board is here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=2020)|
| 0:33:44| or somebody is here if anybody had any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=2024)|
| 0:33:47| But if you remember a few years back, probably it looks like from the timeline,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=2027)|
| 0:33:54| probably around 2013, 2014, they really started to, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=2034)|
| 0:33:58| the age of volunteerism is kind of dwindling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=2038)|
| 0:34:02| So we're trying to find a new format,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=2042)|
| 0:34:05| and we also have a study hopefully coming in the next month or so from CTAS| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=2045)|
| 0:34:11| that will talk about our emergency services outside the city limits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=2051)|
| 0:34:14| And so it will get us to a talking point of where we're at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=2054)|
| 0:34:17| But with the funding in the budget that we approved, and then plus this funding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=2057)|
| 0:34:21| we'll have increased the rescue squad another 50,000 up to 550 for the total year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=2061)|
| 0:34:27| So we both, all three departments have seen great improvements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=2067)|
| 0:34:30| but we're going to need a long-term sustainable plan to maintain service outside the city limits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=2070)|
| 0:34:35| So we need to talk about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=2075)|
| 0:34:36| If you all had any questions for them, they're here, and I appreciate them being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=2076)|
| 0:34:46| Any further discussion amongst the commissioners?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=2086)|
| 0:34:51| Commissioner Skinner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=2091)|
| 0:34:52| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=2092)|
| 0:34:53| Mr. Caldwell, what was the total for the AT&T billing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=2093)|
| 0:34:57| Was that like $34,000, or is it more than that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=2097)|
| 0:35:05| I'm just going to do this as I go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=2105)|
| 0:35:07| $17,000 for county clerk, $10,000 for juvenile court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=2107)|
| 0:35:16| There was another one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=2116)|
| 0:35:17| ITs is mixed in with something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=2117)|
| 0:35:19| ITs is $20,000, and then medical examiner is another $10,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=2119)|
| 0:35:23| So that's $30,000, $40,000, $57,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=2123)|
| 0:35:26| Okay, $57,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=2126)|
| 0:35:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=2127)|
| 0:35:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=2128)|

| 0:41:24| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=2484)|
| 0:41:25| Jim Snowden, 205 West Baxter Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=2485)|
| 0:41:27| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=2487)|
| 0:41:29| I was looking at this map, and is this the property owner that's sitting with you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=2489)|
| 0:41:34| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=2494)|
| 0:41:35| It's the representative of the property owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=2495)|
| 0:41:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=2496)|
| 0:41:37| The only thing I want to make sure is that by closing down any of these roads,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=2497)|
| 0:41:40| we do not deny any access for any emergency or if a bridge goes out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=2500)|
| 0:41:45| We don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=2505)|
| 0:41:46| There is one other property owner minus the property owner representative here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=2506)|
| 0:41:51| and that person will be provided access prior to the road closure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=2511)|
| 0:41:55| So the only closure affected will be Mrs. Cox and her estate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=2515)|
| 0:42:00| Now, all this land is owned by the same family?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=2520)|
| 0:42:02| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=2522)|
| 0:42:03| It's all actually one contiguous piece of property separated by the roadway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=2523)|
| 0:42:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=2527)|
| 0:42:10| Is it her nephew?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=2530)|
| 0:42:12| Mr. Bussler?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=2532)|
| 0:42:13| Is it her nephew?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=2533)|
| 0:42:14| I'm sorry?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=2534)|
| 0:42:15| Is it her nephew from Florida?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=2535)|
| 0:42:17| This is Vernon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=2537)|
| 0:42:18| He's the gentleman that manages the farm for Mr. Fetzer that lives in Florida.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=2538)|
| 0:42:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=2542)|
| 0:42:30| I guess my question was if this family decides to split this land up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=2550)|
| 0:42:34| will this create any access problems in the future?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=2554)|
| 0:42:38| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=2558)|
| 0:42:39| They have actually improved access with the new roadway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=2559)|
| 0:42:42| so I would think if they do want to subdivide at some point in the future,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=2562)|
| 0:42:45| their access is actually improved due to the new roadway construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=2565)|
| 0:42:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=2568)|
| 0:42:50| We have a motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=2570)|

| 0:42:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=2574)|
| 0:42:55| Mr. Bussler?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=2575)|
| 0:42:56| Where that road was at, has that asphalt been taken up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=2576)|
| 0:43:00| A portion of it has, Commissioner Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=2580)|
| 0:43:03| The portion near the cemetery was removed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=2583)|
| 0:43:07| We coordinated the removal of that limits with the property owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=2587)|
| 0:43:10| They wanted some of it to be retained so that they could still access their barns and farm equipment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=2590)|
| 0:43:20| We have a motion and a second to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=2600)|

| 0:44:59| I really enjoyed reading these numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=2699)|
| 0:45:02| It's a good thing to put me to sleep at night, but I was looking at all the numbers and spaces that you need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=2702)|
| 0:45:09| This is a 2015 study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=2709)|
| 0:45:12| It says it's 211,168 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=2712)|
| 0:45:18| I was just wanting to know, have you all been actively looking for a place?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=2718)|
| 0:45:22| Because I think you wanted to combine all three of your different facilities under one, not one roof, but in one particular area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=2722)|
| 0:45:32| Have you all been in the process of looking for anything?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=2732)|
| 0:45:36| Mr. Chairman, members of the Commission, Bob Thomas, 912 South Gay Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=2736)|
| 0:45:41| We have been in conversation with the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=2741)|
| 0:45:44| Obviously, for the efficiency, the more we could get under one roof and on one space, the better it would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=2744)|
| 0:45:51| But, really, the county has been sort of leading the way in this search,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=2751)|
| 0:45:55| so Chris Caldwell really has more information than I would have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=2755)|
| 0:46:00| But, obviously, for efficiency purposes, getting our maintenance and getting our central office all under one roof| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=2760)|
| 0:46:10| or on one plot of property would be the most efficient.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=2770)|
| 0:46:14| But, again, Mr. Caldwell has been sort of leading the charge with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=2774)|
| 0:46:19| Well, I was asking that, too, Chris, if you could give me some information, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=2779)|
| 0:46:23| If we're going to go to this way where we're going to try to get everything under one, not one roof, but in the same area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=2783)|
| 0:46:31| do we have any cost estimates of what that would be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=2791)|
| 0:46:36| Yeah, I guess since we've started this process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=2796)|
| 0:46:40| we've probably looked at 10 or 15 different options as far as places that would work for centralizing schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=2800)|
| 0:46:48| Some would be more than just schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=2808)|
| 0:46:50| Sometimes it's just schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=2810)|
| 0:46:52| And so we look at things like that, and we get price estimates and price them out, sometimes because of cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=2812)|
| 0:46:58| Then those options are not feasible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=2818)|
| 0:47:04| That's very true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=2824)|
| 0:47:06| Other times they work, and we explore them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=2826)|
| 0:47:08| So I think for us, we've narrowed it down to less than five that could potentially work and keep on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=2828)|
| 0:47:19| We try to narrow that approach and come back to a cost of what it would cost to move schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=2839)|
| 0:47:26| and maybe other things as well and try to determine if that's the best course of action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=2846)|
| 0:47:33| And so to answer your question probably as vaguely as possible, we continue to look,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=2853)|
| 0:47:40| but I don't feel comfortable sitting here telling you where we're looking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=2860)|
| 0:47:44| so those places will know that they can raise their rates on us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=2864)|
| 0:47:48| Well, I wouldn't want that, but as a cost range, is there some number out there that we're looking at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=2868)|
| 0:47:54| or would be looking at what it would cost?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=2874)|
| 0:47:59| I mean, just a number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=2879)|
| 0:48:02| It's going to depend on whether you lease or whether you buy and the amount of space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=2882)|
| 0:48:07| Chris?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=2887)|
| 0:48:08| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=2888)|
| 0:48:09| I guess what he's going at, and he's going at the all-inclusive one place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=2889)|
| 0:48:13| and I guess that site that we could talk about because it is our own site would be Rural.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=2893)|
| 0:48:18| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=2898)|
| 0:48:19| What was that figure?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=2899)|
| 0:48:21| Rural, we actually had a price for Rural High School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=2901)|
| 0:48:26| This has been three or four years ago where if we centralized all of school administration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=2906)|
| 0:48:34| and maintenance and everything at Rural High School, it was about $40 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=2914)|
| 0:48:39| And so you say, well, that's a big number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=2919)|
| 0:48:42| It is a big number, but that would be centralizing everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=2922)|
| 0:48:45| And so maintenance, Sarah Simpson, I mean, that was everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=2925)|
| 0:48:50| That was a big number, and so we backed away from that number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=2930)|
| 0:48:53| And so have we explored looking at just administration up there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=2933)|
| 0:48:59| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=2939)|
| 0:49:00| And so you could do what it is, the cost of a square foot for a new building, and do that number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=2940)|
| 0:49:07| It's probably $15 million if you just build an admin building at Rural because we own it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=2947)|
| 0:49:12| So we could just build new and do the cost per square foot and get to that number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=2952)|
| 0:49:18| So the question is, what is a number that we feel is feasible?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=2958)|
| 0:49:25| That option did allow for probably four or five properties to be liquidated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=2965)|
| 0:49:30| Some did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=2970)|
| 0:49:31| We have looked at a few options that would liquidate a few parcels, some that are interest to the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=2971)|
| 0:49:41| I think there's a number of options on the table,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=2981)|
| 0:49:45| and so you just continue to look to see what is best.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=2985)|
| 0:49:54| I would encourage you, you can call me if you want to talk about specifics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=2994)|
| 0:49:59| We can go over those because I get that occasionally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=2999)|
| 0:50:03| What I'm asking about, an old term you use is the juice worth the squeezing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=3003)|
| 0:50:08| I mean, you're going to sell a property for what it looks like right now for $6 million,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=3008)|
| 0:50:12| and then we're going to go $40 million in another area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=3012)|
| 0:50:18| I don't think we're going to go $40.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=3018)|
| 0:50:20| I mean, that's not going to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=3020)|
| 0:50:21| I mean, if something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=3021)|
| 0:50:24| What I'm saying is I'm trying to get in my mind what's the best for the taxpayers of Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=3024)|
| 0:50:32| and you have one on one hand where we're at, and then we're going to someplace else| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=3032)|
| 0:50:37| that's going to be quite a bit more expensive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=3037)|
| 0:50:39| I think that's something we really need to do the research and be looking at now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=3039)|
| 0:50:44| and be getting ready to move.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=3044)|
| 0:50:47| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=3047)|
| 0:50:48| I can tell you, we've done the research for over a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=3048)|
| 0:50:50| I mean, it's not like we've not been doing it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=3050)|
| 0:50:52| and so it is trying to find the number that we feel is reasonable in selling of the AJ| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=3052)|
| 0:50:59| and moving somewhere else, and is that just schools, or is that just the administration?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=3059)|
| 0:51:06| Is it other things?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=3066)|
| 0:51:07| And so we look at those, and we continue to look at them, and as of now, it's just exploration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=3067)|
| 0:51:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=3075)|
| 0:51:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=3076)|
| 0:51:17| Commissioner Skidmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=3077)|
| 0:51:18| Mr. Chairman, Mr. Caldwell, of the five parcels that you've identified,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=3078)|
| 0:51:22| how many of those are leased options, and how many are purchase options?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=3082)|
| 0:51:32| One we own, so we can go ahead and get that one off the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=3092)|
| 0:51:37| One for sure would be we would buy, and one would want us to lease,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=3097)|
| 0:51:44| but we never would want to lease.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=3104)|
| 0:51:45| We'd want to buy that one, and then one is a lease.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=3105)|
| 0:51:48| Okay, and then the school system is requiring how much square footage total| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=3108)|
| 0:51:55| and how many parking spaces?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=3115)|
| 0:51:58| So, yeah, so what we have done through a contract is we have gotten their square footage number down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=3118)|
| 0:52:06| I think it's about 95,000 square foot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=3126)|
| 0:52:09| Is that about right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=3129)|
| 0:52:10| And so that number is about 90 parking spaces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=3130)|
| 0:52:12| I can't remember what that's down to, Russ.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=3132)|
| 0:52:14| 400?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=3134)|
| 0:52:15| And so 400 parking spaces, 90,000 square feet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=3135)|
| 0:52:20| and so that's assuming the space is efficient and not cut up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=3140)|
| 0:52:26| so that's very important to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=3146)|
| 0:52:28| And that's just for administration only, or is that for combining?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=3148)|
| 0:52:31| That's administration only.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=3151)|
| 0:52:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=3152)|
| 0:52:33| Now, what if you combined all departments under one roof?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=3153)|
| 0:52:36| Because he says a report says 211,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=3156)|
| 0:52:40| Is that what you said?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=3160)|
| 0:52:41| That's if you have Sarah Simpson and everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=3161)|
| 0:52:43| That's warehouse space, everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=3163)|
| 0:52:45| Yes, and the reason why I asked for that, what are they needing for offices and things like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=3165)|
| 0:52:51| so we know what we're looking for, because if they're going to combine all of it together,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=3171)|
| 0:52:56| it's going to be a pretty massive undertaking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=3176)|
| 0:53:00| That's what I'm trying to determine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=3180)|
| 0:53:01| So are we in the 220,000 square feet, or are we ñ nobody wants to say anything?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=3181)|
| 0:53:07| Russ Oaks will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=3187)|
| 0:53:10| I'll take a shot at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=3190)|
| 0:53:11| We've looked at this over several years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=3191)|
| 0:53:14| and the Great Schools Partnership paid to have McCarty-Holzheim do a study for us several years ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=3194)|
| 0:53:23| to look at our space needs, and if we consolidated our administration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=3203)|
| 0:53:28| and our training facility at the Sarah Simpson facility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=3208)|
| 0:53:34| and then our warehouse space and put all of that together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=3214)|
| 0:53:38| And if you look at all of the administrative space, the warehouse space,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=3218)|
| 0:53:42| the training space from Sarah Simpson, it works out to about 211,000 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=3222)|
| 0:53:48| That does nothing with our maintenance facility that's currently located over at 5th Avenue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=3228)|
| 0:53:54| between 5th Avenue and Magnolia, where it currently sits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=3234)|
| 0:53:58| That's untouched.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=3238)|
| 0:54:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=3240)|
| 0:54:01| And that facility, you're still leasing the maintenance facility?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=3241)|
| 0:54:03| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=3243)|
| 0:54:04| We own the majority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=3244)|
| 0:54:05| We own the maintenance facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=3245)|
| 0:54:07| We're currently leasing several acres of parking over there on an annual basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=3247)|
| 0:54:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=3253)|
| 0:54:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=3254)|
| 0:54:16| Commissioner Thomas?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=3256)|
| 0:54:19| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=3259)|
| 0:54:20| Just a quick question for you, gentlemen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=3260)|
| 0:54:24| In this consolidation, if you will, of as many people as possible, how many people are we talking about?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=3264)|
| 0:54:37| In the A.J., about 234, I believe, in the A.J.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=3277)|
| 0:54:42| I'm not sure on Simpson facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=3282)|
| 0:54:46| I don't know if Russ has got that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=3286)|
| 0:54:48| There's only half a dozen or so people that work directly out of the Simpson Center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=3288)|
| 0:54:52| but there are dozens and sometimes hundreds that go through there every day for various meetings and training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=3292)|
| 0:54:59| We're looking at, say, 250 or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=3299)|
| 0:55:03| For the Simpson Center and training, we sometimes have 300 to 500 people in there a day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=3303)|
| 0:55:11| Gotcha.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=3311)|
| 0:55:12| You've been to the principal for a day thing, Mr. Thomas?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=3312)|
| 0:55:15| That's there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=3315)|
| 0:55:16| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=3316)|
| 0:55:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=3317)|
| 0:55:18| In the studies that have been done, has there been any consideration where most of those people live?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=3318)|
| 0:55:26| I'm sorry, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=3326)|
| 0:55:27| I'm not sure I understood the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=3327)|
| 0:55:28| All these employees that will be driving in or coming in to work every day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=3328)|
| 0:55:33| I just wonder if any consideration was given to what part of town they actually live in, the majority of them, as the search goes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=3333)|
| 0:55:41| We have not done that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=3341)|
| 0:55:43| Our consideration and what we had asked the county to look at was to have a centrally located facility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=3343)|
| 0:55:52| that would be equidistant from most areas of the county and that would also be accessible by CAT bus so that we can both serve our constituents and our employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=3352)|
| 0:56:05| I think the other challenge with looking at where all the employees live is that the location of our facility rarely changes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=3365)|
| 0:56:14| but where our employees live is a moving target on any given day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=3374)|
| 0:56:19| Just like the schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=3379)|
| 0:56:20| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=3380)|
| 0:56:21| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=3381)|
| 0:56:22| I just wonder if it was part of the study whatsoever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=3382)|
| 0:56:23| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=3383)|
| 0:56:24| Russ?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=3384)|
| 0:56:25| The employees that are at Lincoln Park also, they would be, I guess, be consolidated in this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=3385)|
| 0:56:30| Are there any other facilities like that that we would have a building where we have several employees that would be relocated?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=3390)|
| 0:56:36| You're asking me to remember something that's in a document I haven't looked at in a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=3396)|
| 0:56:45| Let me say, Lincoln Park, I don't recall being part of those facilities that we looked at being consolidated under the work that was done by McCarty-Holesapple.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=3405)|
| 0:56:56| It was where it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=3416)|
| 0:56:59| We're making much greater use of Lincoln Park today than we were six months ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=3419)|
| 0:57:04| We've done a lot of work over there, and it has shown to be a valuable facility for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=3424)|
| 0:57:12| If we were to consolidate Lincoln Park, and the superintendent and I haven't said a word about this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=3432)|
| 0:57:19| we would have to look very carefully at that and the investment that we've already made in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=3439)|
| 0:57:27| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=3447)|
| 0:57:28| Commissioner Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=3448)|
| 0:57:29| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=3449)|
| 0:57:30| Do we have any continued footprints in the old Sears Tower building that's on Central other than the closed closet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=3450)|
| 0:57:40| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=3460)|
| 0:57:41| That's our warehouse space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=3461)|
| 0:57:42| We've got that over there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=3462)|
| 0:57:43| We've got an information technology computer repair and distribution that's over there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=3463)|
| 0:57:50| And our mail room is also located over there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=3470)|
| 0:57:54| Those facilities were considered in that 211,000 square feet that McCarty-Holesapple put together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=3474)|
| 0:58:01| And I just wanted to, thank you, Mr. Chairman, briefly ask about Eastport.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=3481)|
| 0:58:05| Do we still have continuing services under the old Eastport location?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=3485)|
| 0:58:13| There are probably a dozen or more folks that work out of Eastport or work at Eastport on a daily basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=3493)|
| 0:58:19| It's about 10,000 square feet and mostly used for short-term or long-term storage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=3499)|
| 0:58:30| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=3510)|
| 0:58:32| The report that I've got right here has three categories.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=3512)|
| 0:58:36| It says administrative office, professional development is another one, and then the warehousing requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=3516)|
| 0:58:42| And now you're telling me there's more things out there than just under these three categories.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=3522)|
| 0:58:48| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=3528)|
| 0:58:51| We have a number of different what is out there beyond what's in those categories that you look at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=3531)|
| 0:58:59| or what I would call our industrial operations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=3539)|
| 0:59:02| And that's everything that's over at our Fifth Avenue facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=3542)|
| 0:59:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=3549)|
| 0:59:14| Any further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=3554)|
| 0:59:18| Thank you, gentlemen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=3558)|
| 0:59:21| Madam Clerk, next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=3561)|
| 0:59:23| Item number 56 is discussion item on telecommunication tax revenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=3563)|
| 0:59:30| Commissioner Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=3570)|
| 0:59:32| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=3572)|
| 0:59:34| We received a note from County Technical Assistance Services of a new way of looking at this tax revenue that we've got.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=3574)|
| 0:59:44| And what I've got from Perry or Chris's office that gave me information here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=3584)|
| 0:59:51| we are now receiving, it started in July, a fund of $4,000 a month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=3591)|
| 0:59:58| With this new way of figuring things, they're going to start getting $69,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=3598)|
| 1:00:04| That's an extra $65,000 a month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=3604)|
| 1:00:07| However, this fund is going to be shrinking just like hauls, taxes, and things of that sort going down the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=3607)|
| 1:00:15| Right now, we are not, well, it's started to be putting in the general fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=3615)|
| 1:00:23| We as a commission every now and then have some initiatives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=3623)|
| 1:00:26| One of the ones we were looking at was sports complexes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=3626)|
| 1:00:29| and there could be some other things that we look to enhance the whole county that would benefit the whole county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=3629)|
| 1:00:36| My suggestion on this fund right here, since we're looking to do things to enhance the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=3636)|
| 1:00:43| now here comes Chris, but he's going to tell me things I can't do with it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=3643)|
| 1:00:47| but here's what I'd like to do with it, with the commissions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=3647)|
| 1:00:51| is to set that $65,000, still leave the $4,000 in there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=3651)|
| 1:00:56| and put it in a fund that will go in that was a separate fund that would be hard to draw out of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=3656)|
| 1:01:06| but would fit our initiatives to where we would have two-thirds vote or three-fourths vote| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=3666)|
| 1:01:11| if we have something comes up and we all agree that it's going to benefit the whole county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=3671)|
| 1:01:17| that this fund would be there that we could use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=3677)|
| 1:01:20| and not being into the general fund that when that fund finally goes away,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=3680)|
| 1:01:26| we're going to have a hole there, just like the haul tax, to fill back up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=3686)|
| 1:01:31| But it would be initiatives that would be beneficial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=3691)|
| 1:01:34| and that would be for the commission to decide which way to go with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=3694)|
| 1:01:39| And if we don't use the fund, then we put it right back in the general fund| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=3699)|
| 1:01:43| and distribute however it should be distributed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=3703)|
| 1:01:48| And that was one thing that I was thinking about this telecommunication tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=3708)|
| 1:01:54| Now, we can create funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=3714)|
| 1:01:58| We can put some things in here as a commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=3718)|
| 1:02:03| I've tried to look through our charter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=3723)|
| 1:02:07| but how to not use it like a drunken sailor on shore leave,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=3727)|
| 1:02:12| but use it for the benefit of the county would be a great option for us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=3732)|
| 1:02:16| to do some of these initiatives you all talked about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=3736)|
| 1:02:20| So anyway, if you want to discuss it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=3740)|
| 1:02:22| I know Chris is going to tell me some ways that we could set the fund up, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=3742)|
| 1:02:27| My point is really simple.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=3747)|
| 1:02:29| That funding is not there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=3749)|
| 1:02:30| You approved that appropriation in the budget for 19,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=3750)|
| 1:02:34| and that money is already accounted for in the general fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=3754)|
| 1:02:38| The time to set up such a fund would be during the budget process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=3758)|
| 1:02:41| That would be correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=3761)|
| 1:02:42| And that fund, we knew about the change in that telecommunications tax revenue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=3762)|
| 1:02:48| and that was budgeted in the general fund in the budget you all approved for FY19.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=3768)|
| 1:02:53| So the fund that just came out in July that we found about the rescheduling| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=3773)|
| 1:02:58| had already been figured into your budget for next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=3778)|
| 1:03:01| We was getting it before July, actually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=3781)|
| 1:03:03| Yeah, but I think what this says right here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=3783)|
| 1:03:07| and what I got from the lady from the state said you could use it any way that you wanted to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=3787)|
| 1:03:18| but I just got the information there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=3798)|
| 1:03:20| And I'm sorry if you already budgeted in there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=3800)|
| 1:03:22| but I thought it would be a way that we could fund some of our initiatives| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=3802)|
| 1:03:26| that kind of came to us in a roundabout way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=3806)|
| 1:03:33| So I'm through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=3813)|
| 1:03:37| Mr. Skidmark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=3817)|
| 1:03:38| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=3818)|
| 1:03:39| Chris, this is not additional tax that's off of mobile telecommunications devices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=3819)|
| 1:03:47| Where is this big increase coming from then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=3827)|
| 1:03:50| The state changed how they distributed telecommunications tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=3830)|
| 1:03:54| I don't know the specifics behind the change,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=3834)|
| 1:03:58| but it led to an increase of what we were receiving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=3838)|
| 1:04:00| We received about $65,000 in FY18,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=3840)|
| 1:04:04| and we budgeted, of course, the increase in 19 of about $625,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=3844)|
| 1:04:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=3849)|
| 1:04:10| So we actually received a couple of months in 18 that was the increase| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=3850)|
| 1:04:15| and made the call to the state, and they told us what the increase was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=3855)|
| 1:04:18| And so as we prepared the budget for 19, we included that in the general fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=3858)|
| 1:04:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=3863)|
| 1:04:24| But we're also going to then see a decrease in the tax that's collected on the landlines,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=3864)|
| 1:04:31| the existing poles and the right-of-ways, going from a 55% assessment down to a 40%?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=3871)|
| 1:04:40| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=3880)|
| 1:04:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=3881)|
| 1:04:46| Any further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=3886)|
| 1:04:48| Seeing none, Madam Clerk, next item, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=3888)|
| 1:04:52| Discussion item of zoning ordinance for storage units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=3892)|
| 1:04:56| Commissioner Busser.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=3896)|
| 1:05:00| We have a VCA that does a great job, but every now and then things come up that are new.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=3900)|
| 1:05:05| And what happens is they do a zoning appeal and they approve it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=3905)|
| 1:05:12| We've got an issue on some things, and I'm just throwing this out here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=3912)|
| 1:05:15| When we have a reoccurring zoning issue, which this will cause,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=3915)|
| 1:05:22| once we start looking at it after it goes two or three times,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=3922)|
| 1:05:25| then we say we've got to change the zoning ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=3925)|
| 1:05:27| But this kind of storage unit is not a regular roll-up door storage unit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=3927)|
| 1:05:34| It does not fit within the confines of what our zoning ordinance says about those storage units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=3934)|
| 1:05:43| My question to the VCA, and it was a point to the VCA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=3943)|
| 1:05:47| was we should get some recommendations from them to say here's the recurring problem that we face| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=3947)|
| 1:05:54| instead of having it have to come back and somebody has to file a zoning variance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=3954)|
| 1:06:01| since this is going to be in now on in our communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=3961)|
| 1:06:06| In fact, we've got two that goes within the two-acre requirement that's already in the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=3966)|
| 1:06:12| and ours still has the two-acre requirement, and that land use can be better utilized| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=3972)|
| 1:06:17| and we can get a little bit better tax revenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=3977)|
| 1:06:20| But we should have those come to us and say we need to take a look at it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=3980)|
| 1:06:24| our recommendation to add to our zoning ordinance to take care of these new issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=3984)|
| 1:06:31| sort of like we did with the Airsoft and some of the other things we've done here lately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=3991)|
| 1:06:36| So my question is we need to charge the VCA when we get like two or three of these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=3996)|
| 1:06:41| that could be coming up in the future, go ahead and take care of it now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=4001)|
| 1:06:46| to where that individual, if it's a mom and pop,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=4006)|
| 1:06:49| that they don't have to go back months to get things started in their business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=4009)|
| 1:06:53| So we just need a recommendation when they see this to come to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=4013)|
| 1:06:58| I have spoke with Director Green of MPC, and there will be an ordinance change coming to us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=4018)|
| 1:07:04| I believe, next month on this very issue of the lot size| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=4024)|
| 1:07:08| as it deals with indoor versus outdoor storage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=4028)|
| 1:07:12| I'm not sure if VCA is the place to do this kind of monitoring and recommendation as much as MPC is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=4032)|
| 1:07:20| They see it more, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=4040)|
| 1:07:23| It all goes through their office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=4043)|
| 1:07:27| Does he have something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=4047)|
| 1:07:29| No, I don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=4049)|
| 1:07:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=4051)|
| 1:07:34| Commissioner Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=4054)|
| 1:07:35| Sitting on VCA for about eight years, we had come to two front lots issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=4055)|
| 1:07:42| that we brought before MPC and the county commission changed the codes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=4062)|
| 1:07:47| We had an issue with swimming pools that kept coming before VCA variances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=4067)|
| 1:07:53| We went to MPC, the county commission has changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=4073)|
| 1:07:56| So, yes, VCA is a good place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=4076)|
| 1:07:59| If they see something every month or every two or three months, they need to mention that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=4079)|
| 1:08:04| Codes needs to say, hey, law department, we need to look at changing this code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=4084)|
| 1:08:08| So it is a good starting point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=4088)|
| 1:08:10| I agree with Commissioner Bussler that when I first started, John and I were there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=4090)|
| 1:08:17| I bet you we had three swimming pools a month for variances,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=4097)|
| 1:08:20| and then we got it changed and we have zero swimming pool variances basically now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=4100)|
| 1:08:24| So that is a great place to start.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=4104)|
| 1:08:27| Was that a fencing issue or a setback?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=4107)|
| 1:08:31| Setback issue, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=4111)|
| 1:08:34| And two front, you know, if you're in subdivision, you've got A road and B road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=4114)|
| 1:08:38| You've got two front.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=4118)|
| 1:08:40| You've got two fronts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=4120)|
| 1:08:41| So we got that issue settled, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=4121)|
| 1:08:50| Madam Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=4130)|
| 1:08:53| Discussion item regarding chair of county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=4133)|
| 1:08:57| Commissioner Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=4137)|
| 1:08:59| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=4139)|
| 1:09:01| Since I've been on this board, this commission, we do not discuss what we see in a chairman's responsibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=4141)|
| 1:09:14| To give you an example, the chair, when he's elected, will have seven chair positions that he will hold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=4154)|
| 1:09:21| We have six standing committees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=4161)|
| 1:09:24| We have 13 other committees that will be appointed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=4164)|
| 1:09:28| And that's the power of the chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=4168)|
| 1:09:30| We also have things in here that they can create subcommittees like the legislative committee we talked about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=4170)|
| 1:09:39| But we ought to have some things to look into other items that comes up and be brought before you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=4179)|
| 1:09:45| For instance, we looked at doing ballparks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=4185)|
| 1:09:51| And, you know, these baseball parks generates quite a bit of money for the people that run the event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=4191)|
| 1:10:00| And I've got a park from Knox County Parks and Rec facility reservation policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=4200)|
| 1:10:10| And in here it does something that kind of ties up the park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=4210)|
| 1:10:18| Let's just put it that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=4218)|
| 1:10:20| Between October the 3rd and October the 31st of this year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=4220)|
| 1:10:25| they will open the period to reserve facilities for the ballparks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=4225)|
| 1:10:32| After that, it gives you instructions that they have up until January the 1st| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=4232)|
| 1:10:36| to pay their deposit on those park facilities of $250.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=4236)|
| 1:10:41| We've had instances in here where a large organization comes in here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=4241)|
| 1:10:47| and buys up all those uses of those parks and they're sitting there sometimes not being used just to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=4247)|
| 1:10:57| they can sublease these ballparks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=4257)|
| 1:11:00| If they run out and don't have an activity going, say a group coming in to play that weekend or two weekends,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=4260)|
| 1:11:09| they sublease it and they sublease it out and they make money off the parks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=4269)|
| 1:11:14| Now, we're not in here to hold down building the economy up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=4274)|
| 1:11:21| but some of those fields go in there and make anywhere from $11,000, $12,000, $14,000 a vent just running it for a weekend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=4281)|
| 1:11:31| Looked into it and it in some ways can affect some parts of our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=4291)|
| 1:11:36| If I wanted to run a, say next year, say May or June,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=4296)|
| 1:11:42| somebody comes up and said we've got some people that we need to help,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=4302)|
| 1:11:47| say in some of the inner cities or some of the low income areas that want to start some ball teams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=4307)|
| 1:11:54| Well, if we wanted to run a weekend tournament| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=4314)|
| 1:12:01| and we wanted to buy some rec leagues out of Campbell County or Union County and some of these others,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=4321)|
| 1:12:07| not these big, you know, diamond facilities or whatever they're called, some of these big name organizations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=4327)|
| 1:12:16| They've already got this tied up, but if we could run something here and build just one weekend,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=4336)|
| 1:12:21| we could build enough money to where we could fund these kids in these inner cities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=4341)|
| 1:12:26| But as of right now, if they tie this up for next year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=4346)|
| 1:12:31| and we decide we're going to do our facilities and expand the facilities and they still come in and tie it up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=4351)|
| 1:12:38| then we cannot get to the young people that we really need to get to that plays ball| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=4358)|
| 1:12:43| in some of these economic challenge places.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=4363)|
| 1:12:49| And it would just take one weekend, but you couldn't do that now because I'd have to sublease it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=4369)|
| 1:12:55| And when you sublease it, you would pay an additional fee and then plus fees on top of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=4375)|
| 1:13:01| And how are the fields taken care of?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=4381)|
| 1:13:06| The biggest places that they go out of town, there's other places they need funding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=4386)|
| 1:13:10| but anyway, I could go down the line of funding that this could generate if we could use those fields.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=4390)|
| 1:13:15| Also, you look into it of the chair and the committees that you'll be on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=4395)|
| 1:13:23| The new people that are coming in need to know what committees are available,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=4403)|
| 1:13:29| but the chair has the ability to appoint to those chairs, you know, once they're elected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=4409)|
| 1:13:34| That's the chairman's job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=4414)|
| 1:13:37| And who's the best to fill some of those positions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=4417)|
| 1:13:40| Now, having said that, we're going to come in on the fourth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=4420)|
| 1:13:48| Put that on your calendar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=4428)|
| 1:13:49| Yeah, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=4429)|
| 1:13:51| On the fourth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=4431)|
| 1:13:53| And there's going to be a nomination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=4433)|
| 1:13:57| Now, we're going to choose among ourselves one person that's going to decide who's the best to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=4437)|
| 1:14:06| Who's the best to be in that position?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=4446)|
| 1:14:07| Who's the best to be in that position?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=4447)|
| 1:14:09| And ask them to do that from the chair position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=4449)|
| 1:14:13| And that's the way the chair is set up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=4453)|
| 1:14:20| And I just want people to know that when you select a chairman, how are you going to select that chairman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=4460)|
| 1:14:27| Is it because somebody says that's what they want to do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=4467)|
| 1:14:33| Have you been talked to to vote a certain way?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=4473)|
| 1:14:36| Have you been done all this other thing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=4476)|
| 1:14:38| Or is it we're going to do something that makes sure that everybody here has an equal voice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=4478)|
| 1:14:45| and can do the job in which they're placed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=4485)|
| 1:14:49| There are some people that are better at finance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=4489)|
| 1:14:50| There are some people better at looking at facts and figures and going through laws| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=4490)|
| 1:14:58| and things of that sort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=4498)|
| 1:15:00| So when we go in and we select that chairman next year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=4500)|
| 1:15:06| think of who would be the best that would point the best people to the right jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=4506)|
| 1:15:14| And we don't do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=4514)|
| 1:15:15| We don't really vet our own chairman that we look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=4515)|
| 1:15:18| We come in and we hear from outside who's going to be chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=4518)|
| 1:15:22| And that's all I'm about to say about electing the chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=4522)|
| 1:15:27| We can go forward really fast or we can play the politics inside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=4527)|
| 1:15:32| So just remember that when we're voting for that chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=4532)|
| 1:15:36| And I just want to put that out to you all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=4536)|
| 1:15:39| and look at your responsibilities that you have in here as a commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=4539)|
| 1:15:46| and also look at the charter and read the charter what your responsibilities are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=4546)|
| 1:15:53| Chris came up to us about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=4553)|
| 1:15:55| We put that funding already in there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=4555)|
| 1:15:58| and the TCA code says right now that we could have put it in where we wanted to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=4558)|
| 1:16:06| And that hole is going to start a big hole,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=4566)|
| 1:16:10| and it's going to shrink down to where we have to fill it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=4570)|
| 1:16:12| So let's take a look at some of the things that we're doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=4572)|
| 1:16:15| and what we're doing to protect the counties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=4575)|
| 1:16:17| And that's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=4577)|
| 1:16:18| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=4578)|
| 1:16:19| Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=4579)|
| 1:16:21| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=4581)|
| 1:16:22| I was just going to bring to attention the paperwork that the commission office distributed to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=4582)|
| 1:16:28| Jill, not Jill, Drew had done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=4588)|
| 1:16:31| but it has the current members of each committee plus open slots| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=4591)|
| 1:16:35| so everybody can see what opportunities they are open and available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=4595)|
| 1:16:43| Also, I'd like to suggest, Mr. Chairman,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=4603)|
| 1:16:46| that you send these on to Commissioner-Elect Jay and Commissioner-Elect Biggs as well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=4606)|
| 1:16:53| so they have this for advance notice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=4613)|
| 1:17:01| Any further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=4621)|
| 1:17:04| Madam Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=4624)|
| 1:17:07| Discussion item for review of the commissioner's term of service on the audit committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=4627)|
| 1:17:13| Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=4633)|
| 1:17:15| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=4635)|
| 1:17:17| On your desk you should have a copy of a document that just says composition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=4637)|
| 1:17:23| And where there's been a little bit of confusion in regards to the commission members that serve on the audit committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=4643)|
| 1:17:33| is the audit committee charter says that the commissioners serve a four-year term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=4653)|
| 1:17:41| However, when a commissioner is voted on by this body to serve on that term, that doesn't necessarily happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=4661)|
| 1:17:50| And I'll use Commissioner Nystrom as an example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=4670)|
| 1:17:54| Commissioner Nystrom was elected in August of 2016 and took office on September 1st of 2016.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=4674)|
| 1:18:03| At the commission reorganization meeting, he was given the opportunity to serve on the audit committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=4683)|
| 1:18:11| However, when the resolution is presented from the law director's office with guidance from the commission office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=4691)|
| 1:18:19| he's not assigned a four-year term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=4699)|
| 1:18:22| He's actually now filling the term of former Commissioner Mike Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=4702)|
| 1:18:30| So in this case, instead of serving what would be a normal commission four-year term, he started in 2016.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=4710)|
| 1:18:41| He's now up again in 2018 instead of 2020 when he should have been.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=4721)|
| 1:18:47| Does it say a term of a commissioner or the commissioner serves a four-year term?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=4727)|
| 1:18:54| A commissioner serves a four-year term currently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=4734)|
| 1:18:57| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=4737)|
| 1:18:58| Okay, but he's not given that opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=4738)|
| 1:19:03| It would be like he's just following in line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=4743)|
| 1:19:08| And I don't think we do anything that way now where it's not spelled out to say, hey, this is a four-year term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=4748)|
| 1:19:17| Once you're elected, you should be able to serve your four years, four-year term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=4757)|
| 1:19:22| And he does not have that opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=4762)|
| 1:19:24| And I'm also in the same situation as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=4764)|
| 1:19:27| And Commissioner Wright, I'm not sure exactly your four-year term is up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=4767)|
| 1:19:36| Correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=4776)|
| 1:19:39| Excuse me, my four-year term on commission is not up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=4779)|
| 1:19:42| No, no, on audit committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=4782)|
| 1:19:45| I do not know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=4785)|
| 1:19:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=4787)|
| 1:19:48| I think it is because you weren't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=4788)|
| 1:19:53| I know, but is he filling the balance of somebody else's term?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=4793)|
| 1:19:56| I guess the point is, is once a commissioner leaves, he's out of here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=4796)|
| 1:20:01| If a new commission reorganization says, okay, Commissioner Daley, you're assigned a four-year term, you get to do your four years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=4801)|
| 1:20:11| You don't get to do just two years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=4811)|
| 1:20:13| And with the audit committee, I think everybody knows how important that is to have continuity so that you do have that experience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=4813)|
| 1:20:21| And just recently we had a charter amendment authorizing our external auditor not to be term limited because we wanted to have continuity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=4821)|
| 1:20:32| And I think right now we've got a problem on the audit committee where everybody's leaving because they didn't get their appropriate four-year term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=4832)|
| 1:20:43| Not everybody's leaving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=4843)|
| 1:20:44| There's got to be some of them that are doing the end of a four-year term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=4844)|
| 1:20:49| I mean, on the audit committee you've got myself, John, and Dave Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=4849)|
| 1:20:54| We're the three representatives from county commission on this committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=4854)|
| 1:20:58| Then you have citizen representatives serving on that committee as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=4858)|
| 1:21:03| You look at, when you come on to that, at least on all of our documents got on the committee, it says it's a four-year term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=4863)|
| 1:21:10| I guess what I might ask on this is, and John, you may have already done this, is get the opinion from the law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=4870)|
| 1:21:18| Is this being caused by kind of our windows and drapes not matching with the audit committee charter and the county charter?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=4878)|
| 1:21:26| I mean, to simplify it, it sounds like it's a windows and drapes don't match.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=4886)|
| 1:21:30| Is that the case, Mr. Law Director?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=4890)|
| 1:21:33| Technically, yes, because you end up with a vacancy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=4893)|
| 1:21:37| That's by an expiration of a term, and they have a four-year term, and it's vacated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=4897)|
| 1:21:43| So whoever's appointed has to fill that term the way it's currently written.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=4903)|
| 1:21:48| Not what is proposed before you, but the way we're currently operating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=4908)|
| 1:21:54| I guess my point, to get us kind of in jive, is it better for the audit committee to amend our document| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=4914)|
| 1:22:01| or for this to amend it through the charter?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=4921)|
| 1:22:03| What would be the best way?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=4923)|
| 1:22:06| When I say it, that's what I was referring to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=4926)|
| 1:22:08| Is that something the audit charter should be amending?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=4928)|
| 1:22:11| That's what we have before you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=4931)|
| 1:22:13| Can I just answer that real quickly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=4933)|
| 1:22:14| Yeah, and we did not present a resolution that would amend the audit charter until after this discussion item,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=4934)|
| 1:22:21| so it's something that we could look at this next week and then possibly add it to the agenda next Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=4941)|
| 1:22:29| But the citizen members of the audit committee have also been furnished all the documents as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=4949)|
| 1:22:37| I guess it comes back to intent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=4957)|
| 1:22:39| Which was the intent of the audit charter setup?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=4959)|
| 1:22:42| Was it that a term is four years regardless of who fills it or not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=4962)|
| 1:22:49| It's kind of like when Dave gets elected here in November, and we appoint somebody to his position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=4969)|
| 1:22:58| That person doesn't get four years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=4978)|
| 1:23:00| They get the rest of Dave's term, and our charter is set up that way for a reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=4980)|
| 1:23:04| I guess the question is, can we find out, if the audit committee, which way it actually intended it to be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=4984)|
| 1:23:11| Can I just add?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=4991)|
| 1:23:14| This probably happened when we changed our commission, went to a smaller number,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=4994)|
| 1:23:20| and now we've got four commissioners off and on where four there used to be all at the same time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=5000)|
| 1:23:29| So a four-year was a term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=5009)|
| 1:23:31| So because of Mike Brown and some of them, that kind of left partial appointments there when we reorganized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=5011)|
| 1:23:39| So I think this all came about and has become a problem now because of when we did that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=5019)|
| 1:23:47| Me and Mike both had six-year terms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=5027)|
| 1:23:50| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=5030)|
| 1:23:51| So that's what started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=5031)|
| 1:23:53| It wasn't an issue until we kind of changed on that in terms of our terms of electing our commissioners and all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=5033)|
| 1:24:00| So will it correct itself?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=5040)|
| 1:24:03| It seems like when you look at, say, the Audit Committee and the Pension and Retirement Committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=5043)|
| 1:24:07| both of those, it seems like our intent was to try to have some continuity on those, service on those committees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=5047)|
| 1:24:14| just year over year consistently dealing with these issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=5054)|
| 1:24:18| That was at least my take on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=5058)|
| 1:24:21| And what does the pension say?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=5061)|
| 1:24:22| Is it a four-year term or is it the term of a commissioner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=5062)|
| 1:24:28| Term of a commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=5068)|
| 1:24:30| I think it's the term of a commissioner and then the employees are elected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=5070)|
| 1:24:33| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=5073)|
| 1:24:34| So I don't remember what their term is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=5074)|
| 1:24:35| Is it a four-year term?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=5075)|
| 1:24:36| It would seem like it makes sense to have those two committees have similar structure in terms of appointment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=5076)|
| 1:24:43| Or are there services in terms of office?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=5083)|
| 1:24:48| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=5088)|
| 1:24:50| The current document or the current charter of the Audit Committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=5090)|
| 1:24:56| it specifically says members of the Audit Committee shall serve terms of four years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=5096)|
| 1:25:03| So in Commissioner Nystrom's case, he is a new member of the Audit Committee in 2016,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=5103)|
| 1:25:10| but he is not allowed to serve four years because of the way the commission office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=5110)|
| 1:25:18| and the law office has generated the resolution that authorized him to serve on that committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=5118)|
| 1:25:26| And that's why we brought this paperwork before you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=5126)|
| 1:25:31| Either way we go on this, on September 4th, we're appointing five people to that position, to those positions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=5131)|
| 1:25:43| Or is your intent to keep the board intact the way it is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=5143)|
| 1:25:48| Well, are you then denying Commissioner Nystrom his opportunity to serve four years as it's stated?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=5148)|
| 1:25:56| It says the term is four years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=5156)|
| 1:25:58| It doesn't necessarily say that Commissioner Nystrom's term is four years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=5158)|
| 1:26:02| It says members and him being a new member.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=5162)|
| 1:26:05| He's appointed a member to fill a term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=5165)|
| 1:26:08| So direction from the law director?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=5168)|
| 1:26:13| I don't know what direction you're wanting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=5173)|
| 1:26:15| I don't know what you're trying to accomplish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=5175)|
| 1:26:17| Currently a term is four years, and if a commissioner can't finish it, then you fill the vacancy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=5177)|
| 1:26:22| That's the current situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=5182)|
| 1:26:24| If you want to change it, you can change it to a commissioner who is appointed shall be appointed throughout their term,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=5184)|
| 1:26:35| which means if they appointed Commissioner Nystrom today in September, you're two years away from your next election,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=5195)|
| 1:26:44| then he would have a two-year term going forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=5204)|
| 1:26:48| And if he's reelected and you want to reappoint him, then he'd have a four-year term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=5208)|
| 1:26:53| Currently it's whoever is appointed originally has a four-year term, and if they vacate it for any reason,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=5213)|
| 1:27:00| they may just come to the chairman and say, I've served here six months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=5220)|
| 1:27:04| This is beyond me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=5224)|
| 1:27:05| It's not something I feel comfortable with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=5225)|
| 1:27:07| You may appoint somebody to finish that term, and that's where the oddity comes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=5227)|
| 1:27:12| So I think we're looking to appoint to coincide with the term of office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=5232)|
| 1:27:20| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=5240)|
| 1:27:21| If Mr. Nystrom was appointed in September, then he would have two years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=5241)|
| 1:27:27| It wouldn't be a four-year term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=5247)|
| 1:27:29| The years wouldn't matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=5249)|
| 1:27:30| It would coincide with your term of office, and then the next year that it's appointed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=5250)|
| 1:27:36| it would coincide with whoever replaced that position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=5256)|
| 1:27:40| It could be Commissioner Nystrom again, and at that point, it would be a four-year term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=5260)|
| 1:27:45| So one way to, for lack of a better word, fix this could be if we have everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=5265)|
| 1:27:50| The problem is our terms on this committee and our elected terms are not jobbed up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=5270)|
| 1:27:56| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=5276)|
| 1:27:57| Yeah, and that's why I put the change in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=5277)|
| 1:28:01| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=5281)|
| 1:28:02| That way, whoever is appointed, it will go with their term of office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=5282)|
| 1:28:05| and then it gives you a clean break, and whoever is appointed again has a term of office, whatever it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=5285)|
| 1:28:11| So the commissioners would not necessarily have four-year terms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=5291)|
| 1:28:16| They would be appointed for the duration of their term of office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=5296)|
| 1:28:20| and the other citizens would have four-year terms because they're not subject to coming and going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=5300)|
| 1:28:27| They will be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=5307)|
| 1:28:28| In other words, if Mr. Nystrom were to stay on after we reorganize, he would have a two-year term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=5308)|
| 1:28:36| He couldn't have a four-year term because we cannot go into the future knowing the results of his election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=5316)|
| 1:28:42| Because we're not guaranteed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=5322)|
| 1:28:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=5324)|
| 1:28:45| However, when Commissioner Nystrom was put on there, he wasn't appointed to that, to fill somebody's vacancy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=5325)|
| 1:28:53| He was selected by this body to serve on the Audit Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=5333)|
| 1:28:57| So since he was selected to serve on the Audit Committee, it should follow the guidelines of the four years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=5337)|
| 1:29:03| I think, actually, that we appointed someone to fill the term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=5343)|
| 1:29:06| We appointed it for Brown's term, and they appointed one for Ms. Amy Brawls' term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=5346)|
| 1:29:12| It was you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=5352)|
| 1:29:13| So you all fill the balances of a four-year term because that's the way it's written.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=5353)|
| 1:29:18| What I'm saying is that if we go with this amendment, then it will tie to a commissioner's term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=5358)|
| 1:29:25| And then when you appoint the next one, whatever their term is, they may be four years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=5365)|
| 1:29:30| It may be two years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=5370)|
| 1:29:31| It depends what cycle you're on currently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=5371)|
| 1:29:35| Then it will be what it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=5375)|
| 1:29:40| Commissioner Skinner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=5380)|
| 1:29:44| I mean, I disagree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=5384)|
| 1:29:46| I think if it says four years, that Commissioner Nystrom should have that option to serve four years unless he wants to vacate at some point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=5386)|
| 1:29:56| I didn't agree with John.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=5396)|
| 1:29:58| Let's let him give you a scenario.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=5398)|
| 1:30:01| We've done a good job in our Rules Committee trying to update some of our regulations where we found errors and things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=5401)|
| 1:30:07| and this was just the opportunity to bring the Audit Committee updated is the whole idea behind that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=5407)|
| 1:30:15| And I appreciate the help of the Law Director's Office with the paperwork.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=5415)|
| 1:30:21| I want to address the other ramification of that definition because it's going to be in conflict with what commissioner is and what term is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=5421)|
| 1:30:32| Because when a commissioner who is no longer a commissioner leaves, then he didn't get a four-year term or she didn't get a four-year term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=5432)|
| 1:30:40| That's why it is because it is a commissioner's appointment of a commissioner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=5440)|
| 1:30:45| and it is tied with that elected official's balance of their term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=5445)|
| 1:30:49| If they appointed you next year to reorganization and they appointed you, he's got one year left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=5449)|
| 1:30:55| He can't serve four years because he won't be a commissioner unless he's reelected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=5455)|
| 1:31:01| Let's say he decides not to run again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=5461)|
| 1:31:03| Well, if you go with just the pure four years, that means you would have a non-commissioner in a commissioner's seat for three more years by definition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=5463)|
| 1:31:11| And we can't do that because it is a commissioner's seat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=5471)|
| 1:31:14| So you have a conflict between term or conflict between commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=5474)|
| 1:31:18| So if we did it coinciding with the balance of a term, whether it's a four-year term or a two-year term,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=5478)|
| 1:31:24| the commissioner serves in that position the remainder of their term or coinciding with their term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=5484)|
| 1:31:31| So you have a clean break and you either appoint a four-year term person or a two-year term person depending where they are at the time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=5491)|
| 1:31:38| and that's the chairman who does that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=5498)|
| 1:31:40| So I don't know how you get away from the two-year terms even if you have four years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=5500)|
| 1:31:44| because going away as a commissioner, you could be appointed in the middle of your term,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=5504)|
| 1:31:51| and then you're not a commissioner, especially if you're term limiting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=5511)|
| 1:31:54| So that's the real conflict.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=5514)|
| 1:31:56| I mean, John's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=5516)|
| 1:31:58| Mr. Schoonmaker's right in his approach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=5518)|
| 1:32:01| Then there's the other side where it doesn't fit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=5521)|
| 1:32:03| And if you go with the other side where it doesn't fit, it throws your four years off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=5523)|
| 1:32:07| That's the legal conflict.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=5527)|
| 1:32:11| Mr. Carringer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=5531)|
| 1:32:12| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=5532)|
| 1:32:13| Just, I mean, and I completely understand where John is going and the whole thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=5533)|
| 1:32:17| But, for instance, like Commissioner Runt is coming off this next reorganization,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=5537)|
| 1:32:23| so there's six of us commissioners that are up for reelection in 2020.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=5543)|
| 1:32:30| So if one of the six of us were appointed at this reorganization meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=5550)|
| 1:32:39| six of us could only serve for two years because that is all that we have left as commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=5559)|
| 1:32:47| So we would have to get reelected to be able to serve the next two years of our four years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=5567)|
| 1:32:54| So that's, I think, the easiest way to put it in terms of seeing how we're going to have this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=5574)|
| 1:33:02| Since we changed and went to this smaller commission and our county commission elections are now off,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=5582)|
| 1:33:09| then we're going to always have this probably appointing someone to fill out the rest of a term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=5589)|
| 1:33:17| So that was just my easy take on we're going to have to appoint somebody to fill in commissioner rights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=5597)|
| 1:33:26| And if it's one of us six, we're only going to know for sure we're going to serve two years of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=5606)|
| 1:33:36| By the way, I'm happy with everybody that's serving on the audit committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=5616)|
| 1:33:43| Is there any further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=5623)|
| 1:33:45| Commissioner Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=5625)|
| 1:33:46| I mean Brantley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=5626)|
| 1:33:47| Is it Brantley or Thomas?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=5627)|
| 1:33:48| Brantley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=5628)|
| 1:33:50| I think that the rules committee could solve this just by setting the guidelines for two years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=5630)|
| 1:33:57| Each commissioner on the rules committee serves two years and they can be reelected or be reappointed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=5637)|
| 1:34:04| but just changing the wording will solve that problem, two years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=5644)|
| 1:34:09| That's all you have to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=5649)|
| 1:34:11| That commission doesn't have to do anything to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=5651)|
| 1:34:20| Any further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=5660)|
| 1:34:24| Well, that's too simple.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=5664)|
| 1:34:25| You've got to do something more complex than that before you leave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=5665)|
| 1:34:30| Commissioner Skinnecker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=5670)|
| 1:34:31| I can't wait until the next discussion item comes up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=5671)|
| 1:34:35| So at this point, do not submit a resolution next Monday night to be added to the commission agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=5675)|
| 1:34:43| Is that the feeling I get from?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=5683)|
| 1:34:51| Actually, I thought it should.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=5691)|
| 1:34:52| Me personally, John, I think it should have went through the rules committee first,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=5692)|
| 1:34:55| approached the rules committee to discuss it and see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=5695)|
| 1:34:58| But it's actually the audit charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=5698)|
| 1:35:01| That's the reason it didn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=5701)|
| 1:35:03| Why can't you fix the audit charter and solve the problem?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=5703)|
| 1:35:08| That's what we're attempting to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=5708)|
| 1:35:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=5710)|
| 1:35:11| I thought you were trying to do the commission's charter or the commission's committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=5711)|
| 1:35:16| Is there anything in the commission's rules or charter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=5716)|
| 1:35:18| the commission rules that would have to be changed to coincide with this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=5718)|
| 1:35:21| No?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=5721)|
| 1:35:27| John, if you want to, we can think about this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=5727)|
| 1:35:29| and then we can come back at our meeting and possibly add it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=5729)|
| 1:35:34| We can always add things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=5734)|
| 1:35:36| I didn't get enough time to really look at this and study it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=5736)|
| 1:35:39| I got hit with a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=5739)|
| 1:35:40| I had a really rough week last week, for one thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=5740)|
| 1:35:43| And then I got hit with a lot of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=5743)|
| 1:35:46| It seems like we got more things handed to us tonight than we ever get up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=5746)|
| 1:35:52| Does everybody wish to do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=5752)|
| 1:35:54| Would that be okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=5754)|
| 1:35:55| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=5755)|
| 1:35:56| I mean, I understand John's concern here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=5756)|
| 1:35:59| This is something that if we want to do this, we need to do it before we reorganize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=5759)|
| 1:36:05| We definitely need to do that if we're going to make a change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=5765)|
| 1:36:08| I just hate things coming at me at the last minute,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=5768)|
| 1:36:11| and usually, John, you're the person that hates it as much as I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=5771)|
| 1:36:15| And Carson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=5775)|
| 1:36:17| Carson, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=5777)|
| 1:36:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=5781)|
| 1:36:22| Is there any other items?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=5782)|
| 1:36:29| Discussion regarding the Retirement and Pension Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=5789)|
| 1:36:32| Commissioner Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=5792)|
| 1:36:35| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=5795)|
| 1:36:37| Just, again, I said I was going to be brief and I will be on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=5797)|
| 1:36:42| And going back a little bit of what you're talking here on terms and stuff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=5802)|
| 1:36:48| when I came on commission and was appointed to some of these committees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=5808)|
| 1:36:59| I'd assumed each one of these was a year-to-year changing thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=5819)|
| 1:37:05| And the way I understand, for example, Retirement and Pension Board and a couple of others,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=5825)|
| 1:37:10| it's while you're a commissioner, you're on that board, period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=5830)|
| 1:37:14| But it's never really written down here on this sheet, for example,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=5834)|
| 1:37:19| that if you're an incoming commissioner and the first time you've ever seen this sheet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=5839)|
| 1:37:24| you'd think, well, it's just every year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=5844)|
| 1:37:26| It's year-to-year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=5846)|
| 1:37:27| But it's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=5847)|
| 1:37:29| It's actually four years, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=5849)|
| 1:37:32| I mean, if you had ran for re-election, you'd see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=5852)|
| 1:37:35| No, I'm talking about like a cable committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=5855)|
| 1:37:38| I haven't been on that for four years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=5858)|
| 1:37:41| No, no, no, the Pension Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=5861)|
| 1:37:43| Well, I'm talking about all the boards right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=5863)|
| 1:37:46| I'm warming up to get to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=5866)|
| 1:37:52| Here's my point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=5872)|
| 1:37:57| And the Retirement and Pension Board is a great example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=5877)|
| 1:38:01| When all of you gather together with the new commissioners September 4th, 5 o'clock,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=5881)|
| 1:38:09| I would put careful attention on the Retirement and Pension Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=5889)|
| 1:38:19| And we've got members here that are on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=5899)|
| 1:38:22| Hugh and I, Mr. Schoonmaker, Ed and I, Tracy behind me, Zach sitting over here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=5902)|
| 1:38:30| And the reason I'm saying is if you're going to be on that board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=5910)|
| 1:38:35| you should bring all your facilities with you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=5915)|
| 1:38:37| because you're going to have to be sharp,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=5917)|
| 1:38:39| and it's going to take you three months to get caught up with the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=5919)|
| 1:38:42| It did that just four years ago when I came in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=5922)|
| 1:38:45| It took you three months to figure out which way is up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=5925)|
| 1:38:48| It's an important board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=5928)|
| 1:38:50| It's a difficult board to be on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=5930)|
| 1:38:52| But at this time, it is so important that whoever you all appoint| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=5932)|
| 1:38:57| really is going to put the time in to look very closely at that board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=5937)|
| 1:39:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=5944)|
| 1:39:11| I'm looking at this page, John.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=5951)|
| 1:39:13| Retirement and Pension Board, it says four-year terms or term as commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=5953)|
| 1:39:17| Audit Committee says four-year terms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=5957)|
| 1:39:19| Maybe that's the language we need to use, four-year terms or as commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=5959)|
| 1:39:29| Anything else, Bob?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=5969)|
| 1:39:32| Anybody have anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=5972)|
| 1:39:39| Is there anybody that wishes to speak at public forum?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=5979)|
| 1:39:45| We have public announcements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=5985)|
| 1:39:48| Commissioner Karen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=5988)|
| 1:39:49| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=5989)|
| 1:39:50| I just wanted to offer publicly our condolences to your wife| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=5990)|
| 1:39:57| and to you in losing your father-in-law, Sharon's husband, this past week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=5997)|
| 1:40:03| I'm sure I can speak for all of our commissions that you all have been in our prayers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=6003)|
| 1:40:07| and our thoughts and will continue to be in the days ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=6007)|
| 1:40:12| Pass that along to Sharon also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=6012)|
| 1:40:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=6015)|
| 1:40:16| And thank you all for the flowers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=6016)|
| 1:40:20| We're on to announcements, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=6020)|
| 1:40:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=6022)|
| 1:40:23| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=6023)|
| 1:40:24| We're going to be social on the 25th at Tank Strickland Park, so we would love to see you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=6024)|
| 1:40:31| And on the 31st, come shake a tail feather.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=6031)|
| 1:40:34| I've seen Commissioner Thomas dance moves at the Knoxville Museum of Art,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=6034)|
| 1:40:39| and I just want to say you're looking good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=6039)|
| 1:40:46| Commissioner Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=6046)|
| 1:40:47| First order of business, Chief of Staff, Dean Rice, is this your last day?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=6047)|
| 1:40:53| Last day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=6053)|
| 1:40:54| Last minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=6054)|
| 1:40:55| I heard him say it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=6055)|
| 1:40:56| Come on down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=6056)|
| 1:40:57| You got to stick out your farewell speech together and all that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=6057)|
| 1:41:01| or are you going to cry like I would?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=6061)|
| 1:41:03| Do we have a PowerPoint?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=6063)|
| 1:41:06| Dean Rice, 1-836 Rogers Island Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=6066)|
| 1:41:08| For the past seven years and 50 weeks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=6068)|
| 1:41:11| I've had the privilege of serving as Mayor Burch's Chief of Staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=6071)|
| 1:41:14| and working with each of you and your colleagues before you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=6074)|
| 1:41:17| And I can say without equivocation that you, each of you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=6077)|
| 1:41:20| serve this county in a tremendous way, bring different skill sets to the table,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=6080)|
| 1:41:25| and make Knox County proud every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=6085)|
| 1:41:27| And I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=6087)|
| 1:41:29| As a resident of Knox County and planning to live and grow old,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=6089)|
| 1:41:33| I'm aging in dog years already, so that's not far off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=6093)|
| 1:41:36| This is my home, and I'm proud to have a commission such as yours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=6096)|
| 1:41:41| And the incoming mayor will continue where Mayor Burch's leaves off| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=6101)|
| 1:41:45| and will do a tremendous job as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=6105)|
| 1:41:47| And his Chief of Staff, Brian Hare, will do a tremendous job,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=6107)|
| 1:41:52| and he will be great in that role.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=6112)|
| 1:41:55| And I appreciate each of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=6115)|
| 1:41:57| And call me if you need me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=6117)|

| 1:42:19| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=6139)|

| 1:42:58| and I know he's going to do an incredible job for the county as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180820?start=6178)|
