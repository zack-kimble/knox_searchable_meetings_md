| 2:48:39| He said that he made a motion to approve and you seconded it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=10119)|
| 2:48:44| Now he wishes to change his motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=10124)|
| 2:48:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=10126)|
| 2:48:47| I thought that was a substitute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=10127)|
| 2:48:48| No, that was the original motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=10128)|
| 2:48:50| When you didn't concur, it stays.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=10130)|
| 2:48:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=10133)|
| 2:48:56| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=10136)|
| 2:48:59| I had the pleasure of having a conversation with both separate meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=10139)|
| 2:49:03| Alvin Nance with KCDC and then Bill Lyons with the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=10143)|
| 2:49:09| and very good conversations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=10149)|
| 2:49:13| And came up with, you know, we talked about this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=10153)|
| 2:49:18| and some of the things that you have been talking about, Commissioner Moore,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=10158)|
| 2:49:22| was, you know, I know that John Troyer has been included in on the discussions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=10162)|
| 2:49:32| and I think that's a good idea for John and the administration to be included.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=10172)|
| 2:49:37| And maybe it's just me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=10177)|
| 2:49:39| But I'll find out about these TIFs when I receive my agenda package.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=10179)|
| 2:49:46| And both gentlemen felt like that we should be included sooner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=10186)|
| 2:49:53| and so they have told me that in the future,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=10193)|
| 2:49:59| that they're going to be getting us in the pipeline| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=10199)|
| 2:50:02| or into the conversation about these upcoming TIFs sooner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=10202)|
| 2:50:08| I think it's very important that when a developer is going to be asking for public funds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=10208)|
| 2:50:17| that they have to go through the same scrutiny that we have to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=10217)|
| 2:50:20| If we're going to talk about transparent government, open meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=10220)|
| 2:50:26| that instead of a lot of this going on behind the scenes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=10226)|
| 2:50:35| that it now be more public what projects are coming forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=10235)|
| 2:50:41| And I think that this commission needs to be informed of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=10241)|
| 2:50:44| I think the public should be informed of it before it's just placed on the monthly agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=10244)|
| 2:50:51| And so Mr. Lyons and Mr. Nance have agreed to do that in the future,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=10251)|
| 2:51:00| and I think that's mighty noble of them to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=10260)|
| 2:51:05| They came and they apologized for not doing that sooner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=10265)|
| 2:51:10| So I accept it, and I'm going to vote for this here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=10270)|
| 2:51:16| I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=10276)|
| 2:51:17| I don't like 20-year TIFs, but I would prefer to max them out at 15, if shorter possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=10277)|
| 2:51:25| But I think if we do the 15, try to force it to 15 years tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=10285)|
| 2:51:30| Mr. Craig here is probably going to say then the project doesn't work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=10290)|
| 2:51:34| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=10294)|
| 2:51:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=10297)|
| 2:51:38| If I could address the 20-year piece of all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=10298)|
| 2:51:40| First of all, there have been previous TIFs that this body has approved for 20 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=10300)|
| 2:51:45| The decision of 15 versus 20 years is driven purely by the math.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=10305)|
| 2:51:49| As we were trying to come up with the overall financial package| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=10309)|
| 2:51:52| and the number of dollars that we needed to fill the gap that Ms. Weil talked about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=10312)|
| 2:51:55| the only way to make that work at the current interest rates is doing 20 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=10315)|
| 2:52:01| As we talked at previous committee meetings, in the current economic environment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=10321)|
| 2:52:06| the banks are as skittish as they've ever been.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=10326)|
| 2:52:10| Many are worried they're not going to be here next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=10330)|
| 2:52:14| And having the 20 years simply gives them an extra five years to recoup the same amount of money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=10334)|
| 2:52:22| that they are advancing up front.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=10342)|
| 2:52:24| So what it does is give additional security to make sure that the lender.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=10344)|
| 2:52:29| Our financing package right now, which I talked about before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=10349)|
| 2:52:32| we have a lender who's willing to commit contingent upon the TIF.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=10352)|
| 2:52:35| The TIF is contingent upon the 20 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=10355)|
| 2:52:38| So you start plucking at this thread and it starts to unravel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=10358)|
| 2:52:42| I guess what I would add to that is that a TIF provides a certain amount each year to go towards a payment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=10362)|
| 2:52:53| If you're going to reduce the number of years that you can have the TIF,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=10373)|
| 2:52:59| then you have to reduce the amount of the TIF loan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=10379)|
| 2:53:04| And I don't know if you could go back and compute what the new TIF loan would be on a 15-year basis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=10384)|
| 2:53:09| versus the 20-year basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=10389)|
| 2:53:11| It would be substantially less, I would assume.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=10391)|
| 2:53:13| It would be substantially less.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=10393)|
| 2:53:14| The other issue that I just want to address is this is, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=10394)|
| 2:53:18| each of these projects you have to evaluate on its own merits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=10398)|
| 2:53:21| And that's obviously what you all are doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=10401)|
| 2:53:23| This one is special because it's going to be a difficult one to appraise and to assess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=10403)|
| 2:53:30| And that's not going to happen until the end of the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=10410)|
| 2:53:33| And in the current environment with property values up in the air,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=10413)|
| 2:53:36| this one is not your plain vanilla shell that you can go in and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=10416)|
| 2:53:39| oh, it's this many square feet and this location, therefore it's this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=10419)|
| 2:53:43| We're going to have a new property assessor in the fall,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=10423)|
| 2:53:47| and it will fall to them to figure out exactly how to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=10427)|
| 2:53:50| We're basing the entire calculation on an estimate that may not hold true a year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=10430)|
| 2:53:56| 18 months from now when they go to assess it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=10436)|
| 2:53:58| And so if they come in significantly below on the assessment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=10438)|
| 2:54:01| then that takes down the amount of dollars that are available to service the TIF.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=10441)|
| 2:54:05| So that's why.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=10445)|
| 2:54:06| And you get to pick up the difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=10446)|
| 2:54:08| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=10448)|
| 2:54:09| Personally guaranteed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=10449)|
| 2:54:10| And if there is even one dollar more, that doesn't go to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=10450)|
| 2:54:14| It goes to pay off the TIF loan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=10454)|
| 2:54:16| It does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=10456)|
| 2:54:17| I'm personally and my development partners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=10457)|
| 2:54:19| we are personally guaranteeing this for the full 20 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=10459)|
| 2:54:21| And then hopefully it actually brings in more than,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=10461)|
| 2:54:24| and it will pay off the TIF sooner, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=10464)|
| 2:54:26| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=10466)|
| 2:54:27| Because every dollar that the funds that come in will go towards paying off the TIF| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=10467)|
| 2:54:34| so that hopefully you're paying off the TIF quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=10474)|
| 2:54:37| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=10477)|
| 2:54:38| If the rate goes up or if the assessment goes up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=10478)|
| 2:54:40| then that would end up paying off shortening the maturity of the overall TIF note.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=10480)|
| 2:54:45| All you all are authorizing is the maximum amount and the maximum time frame,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=10485)|
| 2:54:50| but the actual payment is expected to be much less.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=10490)|
| 2:54:57| My only comment is that to KCDC and whoever else is that I don't like to see 20-year TIFs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=10497)|
| 2:55:09| and that hopefully in the future when you, KCDC, is looking at them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=10509)|
| 2:55:14| and they involve us in the process, that we have a chance to say, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=10514)|
| 2:55:19| we don't want to give the max.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=10519)|
| 2:55:23| I know that puts you, you know, between a rock and a hard place right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=10523)|
| 2:55:28| because you've gotten this far.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=10528)|
| 2:55:31| But hopefully with Mr. Lyons and Mr. Nance saying that they'll come to us sooner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=10531)|
| 2:55:38| then we can express our concerns about always going to the max on these TIFs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=10538)|
| 2:55:43| because I don't want to have to do it again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=10543)|
| 2:55:46| And I would just request that's certainly a valid policy decision that you all may want to make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=10546)|
| 2:55:51| in consultation with the city and the finance director and all the rest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=10551)|
| 2:55:54| I would just ask that you not make it on this particular vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=10554)|
| 2:55:58| I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=10558)|
| 2:56:01| Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=10561)|
| 2:56:05| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=10565)|
| 2:56:08| I've looked at this TIF, and I want to say I'm much like the other commissioners here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=10568)|
| 2:56:14| I don't want to give away any taxpayer money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=10574)|
| 2:56:18| But when I look at this TIF and when I've looked at a lot of other TIFs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=10578)|
| 2:56:21| I don't see us giving away any taxpayer money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=10581)|
| 2:56:24| because the money that is going to pay the TIF loan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=10584)|
| 2:56:28| is money that would never exist without the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=10588)|
| 2:56:33| Now, I think in Knoxville and Knox County, we are on the right track.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=10593)|
| 2:56:39| Several years ago, you didn't see a vibrant downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=10599)|
| 2:56:43| You know, me and a couple of friends were riding our bicycles downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=10603)|
| 2:56:47| I'm a little more active than I look.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=10607)|
| 2:56:51| And one of my friends said, you know, and she hadn't been downtown in a few years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=10611)|
| 2:56:55| She was from Maryville, wasn't a Knox County citizen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=10615)|
| 2:56:58| And she said, oh, my, this is like a little Asheville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=10618)|
| 2:57:02| She made frequent trips to Asheville to their revitalized downtown area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=10622)|
| 2:57:06| And I said, no, this is Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=10626)|
| 2:57:08| And I said, this is what this whole area is going to look like in a few years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=10628)|
| 2:57:14| because we're on the right track.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=10634)|
| 2:57:16| And part of that right track is using tax increment financing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=10636)|
| 2:57:20| to restore these old properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=10640)|
| 2:57:23| We're not giving money away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=10643)|
| 2:57:24| We're not writing people checks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=10644)|
| 2:57:26| All we're saying is that if you'll take the risk,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=10646)|
| 2:57:30| then we'll let our taxing authority stand behind this loan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=10650)|
| 2:57:36| And we're not giving away anything that would exist if the project didn't exist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=10656)|
| 2:57:43| So it's a wash.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=10663)|
| 2:57:45| Technically it's taxpayer money because the money comes into the county coffers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=10665)|
| 2:57:50| but it's money we would never, ever see were it not for the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=10670)|
| 2:57:55| And I'll tell you, the proof of the pudding, my grandmother used to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=10675)|
| 2:57:58| the proof of the pudding is in the tasting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=10678)|
| 2:58:02| I think you all should go and taste downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=10682)|
| 2:58:05| It's beautiful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=10685)|
| 2:58:06| We have beautiful parks with fountains.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=10686)|
| 2:58:09| We have really nice restaurants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=10689)|
| 2:58:11| And I think we need to continue that growth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=10691)|
| 2:58:14| And that's why I'm supporting this TIF tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=10694)|
| 2:58:18| Commissioner Moore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=10698)|
| 2:58:20| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=10700)|
| 2:58:21| Just to add a little bit, you know, out of the last 14 TIFs, only two of them have gone 20 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=10701)|
| 2:58:28| And the TIF tonight before us, Gay Street, 500 block, city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=10708)|
| 2:58:33| and county TIF as a percentage of the total capital,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=10713)|
| 2:58:38| the TIF tonight is the most with the exception of one given back in 2004 at 16.6%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=10718)|
| 2:58:53| So, you know, you want to comment on being a percentage?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=10733)|
| 2:58:58| This is what the project is going to look like when it's done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=10738)|
| 2:59:02| This is expensive to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=10742)|
| 2:59:04| It's more expensive than some of the other ones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=10744)|
| 2:59:06| And the reason why this TIF is needed is because the gap is a little bit greater.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=10746)|
| 2:59:12| And that's why we've had to ask for the maximum that we possibly could get.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=10752)|
| 2:59:17| We're going to have to go through and reproduce all of these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=10757)|
| 2:59:20| Luckily, as part of the process, we found the original architectural plans of the SNW.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=10760)|
| 2:59:25| We've found a lot of local craftsmen who are going to be able to work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=10765)|
| 2:59:29| and help to reproduce these things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=10769)|
| 2:59:31| We've got ornamental plaster work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=10771)|
| 2:59:33| We've got special molding and millwork that's going to have to be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=10773)|
| 2:59:37| The facing on the mezzanine is made out of sliced abalone shells.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=10777)|
| 2:59:42| And we've had to find suppliers for all of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=10782)|
| 2:59:44| We've got to recreate the lighting from scratch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=10784)|
| 2:59:46| So all of that that you see is very, very expensive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=10786)|
| 2:59:49| And this is a tough project to pull off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=10789)|
| 2:59:52| But I think given the investment you've already made in the cinema| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=10792)|
| 2:59:56| and given the investment that we've already made in downtown,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=10796)|
| 2:59:59| this is a really good downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=10799)|
| 3:00:03| Just something on a side note, I had on the agenda an update from tax management| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=10803)|
| 3:00:08| looking at doing the audit of the pilots and TIFs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=10808)|
| 3:00:11| And some of them on this list are on the ones that we were getting updates on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=10811)|
| 3:00:16| And I had a conversation with somebody in the property assessor's office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=10816)|
| 3:00:19| and also with tax management.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=10819)|
| 3:00:21| And the problem they say with the three that they've got now is there's exhibits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=10821)|
| 3:00:27| that companies came in here and said they're going to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=10827)|
| 3:00:32| And they're exhibits, but they're not in the contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=10832)|
| 3:00:35| So they're unenforceable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=10835)|
| 3:00:37| So here we've got millions and millions of public funds going out that we have no way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=10837)|
| 3:00:43| if the people don't do what they say, there's no way to recoup public funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=10843)|
| 3:00:51| Not when they're not in the contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=10851)|
| 3:00:52| And they're not written by the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=10852)|
| 3:00:56| I guess the question is, Commissioner Moore,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=10856)|
| 3:00:58| than ask the law director if we can add that language.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=10858)|
| 3:01:03| I mean, I guess who draws it up, Don?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=10863)|
| 3:01:07| Is it you all or the city?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=10867)|
| 3:01:10| Who draws the contract to what they promised us here tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=10870)|
| 3:01:14| and what they promised you all and the city IDB?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=10874)|
| 3:01:18| Who makes them accountable?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=10878)|
| 3:01:20| Once this is approved, the developer's agreement will be drawn up by our lawyers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=10880)|
| 3:01:25| But then we don't get to see it anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=10885)|
| 3:01:27| So if there's things that's omitted or left out, then there's no way to enforce the contract| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=10887)|
| 3:01:32| because that's what the company that's doing the audits now are saying, like on three of them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=10892)|
| 3:01:37| that the contracts are written so poorly and have left out exhibits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=10897)|
| 3:01:41| that there's no way to enforce what they do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=10901)|
| 3:01:47| Or are we just giving the developer the money?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=10907)|
| 3:01:50| If there's provisions that you would like to see in the developer's agreement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=10910)|
| 3:01:53| we'll certainly take that back and share it and see if it's possible to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=10913)|
| 3:01:56| Well, if he says he's going to create 300 jobs, we need to have in there he creates 300 jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=10916)|
| 3:02:01| If he creates 200, then it looks like we would go back and take back some of our money or make him pay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=10921)|
| 3:02:09| Well, as he said, Commissioner, in no disrespect, but those are just estimates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=10929)|
| 3:02:15| We can't hold him to estimates unless he's given us solid numbers to base that on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=10935)|
| 3:02:20| I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=10940)|
| 3:02:21| But tonight we're sitting here going to create a half million in new sales tax, 300 new jobs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=10941)|
| 3:02:25| and at the end of the day we create 20 jobs and we swap just money with other retailers in downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=10945)|
| 3:02:30| How does that benefit the public on public financing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=10950)|
| 3:02:34| I mean, it's almost an argument against it if we start auditing these people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=10954)|
| 3:02:39| and we find out that they've not done what they said they're going to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=10959)|
| 3:02:42| They've swapped money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=10962)|
| 3:02:43| There's no real growth in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=10963)|
| 3:02:45| Again, the authorization is simply for the tax revenues to be generated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=10965)|
| 3:02:50| If the tax revenues are not generated, then we're on the line for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=10970)|
| 3:02:55| We're signing personal guarantees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=10975)|
| 3:02:57| Yeah, but part of the ----| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=10977)|
| 3:02:59| And the ancillary information that's requested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=10979)|
| 3:03:01| If they had asked us how many, you know, electricians we were going to use, we'd provide an estimate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=10981)|
| 3:03:08| That information is provided to help evaluate the overall,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=10988)|
| 3:03:12| but the specifics of what you're authorizing is simply allowing those dollars to flow through,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=10992)|
| 3:03:17| and the bank funds that specifically based on the development and what it thinks it can generate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=10997)|
| 3:03:23| and whether the numbers make sense to the bank.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=11003)|
| 3:03:25| And it's not based if we put a restaurant in the S&W and we think they're going to hire 50 people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=11005)|
| 3:03:31| and they end up hiring 45 because they just happen to be more efficient, that's a good thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=11011)|
| 3:03:36| It means the restaurant is more viable and it potentially will be there for many, many years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=11016)|
| 3:03:40| So as it exists right now, if you want to, again, revise the policy decision to say that it's based on the number of jobs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=11020)|
| 3:03:48| it produces, then, you know, that's certainly within your all's purview.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=11028)|
| 3:03:51| But that's not, we're just simply asked to provide an estimate, which is what we provided.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=11031)|
| 3:03:55| It's not a guarantee of how much those are going to pay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=11035)|
| 3:03:57| It's not a guarantee that it'll even be that number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=11037)|
| 3:04:00| It's information to help you all make an overall decision about the potential ancillary benefits of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=11040)|
| 3:04:07| Would it be a guarantee, like you've got here, I guess you're talking about total investment of 4.9 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=11047)|
| 3:04:13| Say you do a heck of a deal somewhere and get good, cheap contractors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=11053)|
| 3:04:17| and you come in at, say, 3.8 instead of 4.9.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=11057)|
| 3:04:26| I would tell you that the risk that we're taking on is the entire development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=11066)|
| 3:04:33| Our estimate is that it's going to take just under $5 million to get this project done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=11073)|
| 3:04:38| It may take less than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=11078)|
| 3:04:39| It may take more than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=11079)|
| 3:04:41| But we're on the hook for all of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=11081)|
| 3:04:47| Mr. Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=11087)|
| 3:04:49| On your cafeteria, I have an affinity for that because I grew up in Hawkins County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=11089)|
| 3:04:55| and I came down for a 4-H meeting, and the very first restaurant I ever ate at was that cafeteria.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=11095)|
| 3:05:01| And I'll never forget it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=11101)|
| 3:05:02| It was just wonderful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=11102)|
| 3:05:03| It's pleasing to me to see what you're going to do with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=11103)|
| 3:05:06| So I'm going to vote in favor of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=11106)|
| 3:05:07| But I have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=11107)|
| 3:05:08| When you think of cafeteria, you know, you think of cafeteria.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=11108)|
| 3:05:11| But I'm thinking that your plan for this is going to be a bit more upscale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=11111)|
| 3:05:15| Are you going to have like a liquor license and that type of thing with that, or is it going to be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=11115)|
| 3:05:19| We're in discussion with a couple of potential tenants for this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=11119)|
| 3:05:23| and I think it may have potentially gotten misreported in the paper that we were coming back specifically with cafeteria.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=11123)|
| 3:05:28| Frankly, there would be nothing that would please me more if we could pull that off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=11128)|
| 3:05:31| But the folks that we're talking to want to put in restaurants probably, you know, on a little bit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=11131)|
| 3:05:39| if you put it between the brew pub and Ruth's Chris, somewhere in that level of finish,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=11139)|
| 3:05:46| that's the most likely tenant for that space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=11146)|
| 3:05:52| Mr. Pinkston?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=11152)|
| 3:05:53| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=11153)|
| 3:05:54| Sir, is this a corporation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=11154)|
| 3:05:56| I'm sorry?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=11156)|
| 3:05:57| Are you a corporation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=11157)|
| 3:05:59| 500 Block LLC is a partnership, limited liability corporation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=11159)|
| 3:06:03| Well, the longer we make this TIF, the more danger Knox County is in not getting their money back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=11163)|
| 3:06:09| Would that not be correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=11169)|
| 3:06:10| Because there could be a possibility 20 years down the road or 10 years down the road this corporation could go bankrupt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=11170)|
| 3:06:18| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=11178)|
| 3:06:19| Then who is left holding the bag?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=11179)|
| 3:06:21| Well, again, the note that the bank writes is secured first and foremost by the tax, the incremental tax revenues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=11181)|
| 3:06:31| So as long as the businesses are functioning and the property taxes are being paid,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=11191)|
| 3:06:36| then that's where it would be secured first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=11196)|
| 3:06:38| We are simply backstopping that with personal guarantees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=11198)|
| 3:06:41| and the fact is if we're out 10 years or 15 years and the tax revenues are coming in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=11201)|
| 3:06:49| it means that the businesses are functioning, things are going the way that they're intended to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=11209)|
| 3:06:54| So you actually, I think, in my opinion, have less risk as you go along,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=11214)|
| 3:06:59| because once the tracker gets established of the assessment and what revenues are coming in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=11219)|
| 3:07:05| it actually improves the security of the note overall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=11225)|
| 3:07:08| But if you can't get the tenants in here, this project could fail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=11228)|
| 3:07:13| It could, absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=11233)|
| 3:07:15| And then who is going to be responsible?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=11235)|
| 3:07:17| You're looking at him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=11237)|
| 3:07:21| And the bank won't make the loan if they don't feel that I'm going to be good for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=11241)|
| 3:07:25| Again, once you all vote, I still have to go get the bank to fulfill its commitment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=11245)|
| 3:07:30| I understand that, but the bank is loaning you that money based on this tax increment financing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=11250)|
| 3:07:35| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=11255)|
| 3:07:36| But is this the only venture you're in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=11256)|
| 3:07:38| What I'm trying to get at is you're LLC, I believe you say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=11258)|
| 3:07:41| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=11261)|
| 3:07:42| Y'all bet if you belly up and there's no tenants up there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=11262)|
| 3:07:47| something falls through here in the next five years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=11267)|
| 3:07:50| The Knox County taxpayers are not on the hook for any dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=11270)|
| 3:07:54| They're not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=11274)|
| 3:07:55| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=11275)|
| 3:07:56| Who is on the hook?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=11276)|
| 3:07:57| We are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=11277)|
| 3:07:58| If you're bellied up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=11278)|
| 3:07:59| If we're bellied up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=11279)|
| 3:08:01| Because it's secured by the tax revenues, but if you don't have the tenants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=11281)|
| 3:08:04| and the tax revenues are not there, the citizens of Knox County are not out any dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=11284)|
| 3:08:11| Everything has to be generated within the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=11291)|
| 3:08:15| We have to pay this bank note back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=11295)|
| 3:08:17| You all don't have to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=11297)|
| 3:08:19| We have to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=11299)|
| 3:08:21| That means my house, my car.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=11301)|
| 3:08:23| You've got it personally guaranteed as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=11303)|
| 3:08:25| Personally guaranteed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=11305)|
| 3:08:26| Is your wife signing on to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=11306)|
| 3:08:28| My wife will have to sign on to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=11308)|
| 3:08:29| Let me tell you, if you all think you're tough, she is tougher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=11309)|
| 3:08:32| You know, I don't like these deals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=11312)|
| 3:08:33| You know, you see you're going, you know, I think we ran into that with the butcher boys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=11313)|
| 3:08:36| They ran down to Florida and bought a house, you know, because of the bankruptcy laws.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=11316)|
| 3:08:40| Well, she doesn't like Florida.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=11320)|
| 3:08:43| Well, I mean, I'm not trying to, I just want to be sure our taxpayers, I just don't like the 20 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=11323)|
| 3:08:47| I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=11327)|
| 3:08:48| I don't like that at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=11328)|
| 3:08:49| I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=11329)|
| 3:08:50| In this case, in this environment, I mean, you know, while I was sitting here, a lot of things happened outside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=11330)|
| 3:08:54| But one of the things that happened is the stock market went down another 250 points,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=11334)|
| 3:08:58| in part because FDIC closed another couple of banks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=11338)|
| 3:09:02| So, I mean, we've got a lot of uncertainty out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=11342)|
| 3:09:06| There's a lot of uncertainty about what's going to happen with real estate values and everything else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=11346)|
| 3:09:09| And so the little extra of maximum time gives extra security to the bank to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=11349)|
| 3:09:16| it doesn't increase the amount they're going to get, it just says we've got a little extra time if the values aren't there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=11356)|
| 3:09:21| or if the tax rate's not there to try and recoup our loan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=11361)|
| 3:09:27| Commissioner Luthor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=11367)|
| 3:09:28| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=11368)|
| 3:09:33| Following up with Commissioner Moore and what they've said about the attorneys writing up the contracts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=11373)|
| 3:09:40| I think that whatever contracts that they draw up, that KCDC draws up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=11380)|
| 3:09:47| I think they should have to confer with our attorneys since it's our tax dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=11387)|
| 3:09:52| It's the people's tax dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=11392)|
| 3:09:55| And I think the people's attorney should have something to do with drawing up these TIF papers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=11395)|
| 3:10:02| And I would hope that the maker of the motion would accept that as an amendment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=11402)|
| 3:10:09| that the contracts must be approved by our law department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=11409)|
| 3:10:19| As a maker of the substitute motion, I will take that if the second, whoever seconded it would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=11419)|
| 3:10:29| Because if they're writing up a contract that doesn't hold muster and we can't enforce it, then what good is it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=11429)|
| 3:10:39| So I think the law department should give their stamp of approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=11439)|
| 3:10:43| I don't think that should not hinder the process at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=11443)|
| 3:10:49| In fact, it might even help it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=11449)|
| 3:10:55| They do have some certain expertise in this, in contracts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=11455)|
| 3:11:01| And I would hope that the substitute motion and possibly if that doesn't pass,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=11461)|
| 3:11:06| if we have to go back to the original motion, which is the 20-year, I would hope that they would accept that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=11466)|
| 3:11:14| Do you accept that, Commissioner Smith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=11474)|
| 3:11:17| That's a good point, Commissioner Luther.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=11477)|
| 3:11:18| I'll get back with you on that Thursday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=11478)|
| 3:11:21| No, that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=11481)|
| 3:11:22| I agree with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=11482)|
| 3:11:24| Is that okay with you, Don?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=11484)|
| 3:11:29| We certainly will share that again with our legal advice or legal attorneys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=11489)|
| 3:11:36| The developer's agreement doesn't get into that much specific at this time, but we can go back and ask them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=11496)|
| 3:11:44| and then we can share that with the county's law department and see if it's acceptable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=11504)|
| 3:11:51| I think what we want them to do is to sign off before we're on the hook.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=11511)|
| 3:11:55| My understanding, too, is that it's a very technical agreement that just talks about basically how the bank loan is serviced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=11515)|
| 3:12:06| Yeah, but if there's exhibits that should be in there saying that we're going to have this many jobs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=11526)|
| 3:12:12| and we're going to do this and this is how we're going to perform it, why do you even tell us that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=11532)|
| 3:12:18| if at the end of the day we're going to give you $814,000 and, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=11538)|
| 3:12:21| if you come in and your project from 4.9 came in at 1.9, it doesn't matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=11541)|
| 3:12:26| I think that Don used the right word when he said that those are ancillary benefits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=11546)|
| 3:12:30| It's really like the icing on the cake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=11550)|
| 3:12:33| It's part of our application process just because we're interested in getting estimates based on those things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=11553)|
| 3:12:42| The redevelopment area and tax increment financing through the redevelopment area is really a blight removal tool.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=11562)|
| 3:12:49| It's to get these buildings back on the tax rolls and to get them restored.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=11569)|
| 3:12:54| A pilot is a different tool, a different economic development tool that really is focused on jobs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=11574)|
| 3:13:00| but that's not what this one is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=11580)|
| 3:13:02| This one's about getting the buildings back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=11582)|
| 3:13:06| So we ask for additional information that the developers give us as estimates,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=11586)|
| 3:13:12| but that's not information that is intended to go into a contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=11592)|
| 3:13:18| We can't hold the developer to hiring 50 workers at the S&W cafeteria, you know, for instance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=11598)|
| 3:13:26| because at this point, you know, there are no tenants for that project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=11606)|
| 3:13:30| These are all estimates, and so it was never the intention to hold the developer to those kinds of numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=11610)|
| 3:13:37| So I'm having a hard time now understanding why we even asked the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=11617)|
| 3:13:41| It would be like coming to me and saying, Scott, we're going to build.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=11621)|
| 3:13:45| I want this land rezoned for four units an acre, but, you know, I may build 20 or 30.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=11625)|
| 3:13:53| It just kind of depends.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=11633)|
| 3:13:54| If you'll give me the money, I'll build whatever I can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=11634)|
| 3:13:56| The concrete things about the proposal have to do with the buildings getting refinished,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=11636)|
| 3:14:03| them having retail, them having office space, them having commercial use on Gay Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=11643)|
| 3:14:11| As I said, sort of closing that gap that currently exists on Gay Street, bringing life back to downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=11651)|
| 3:14:17| So those are the concrete reasons why we have reviewed and recommended that this TIF be approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=11657)|
| 3:14:25| The ancillary benefits, maybe we're to be faulted for asking for too much information, and we could be guilty of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=11665)|
| 3:14:33| I often am guilty of faulted of asking for too much information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=11673)|
| 3:14:36| You're asking for information, but you don't even know if it's true because you don't even know what's going to be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=11676)|
| 3:14:41| So what you're telling me is really we're just giving them the money to fix the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=11681)|
| 3:14:45| Well, we're very clear that those really are estimates when we ask for those things in the application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=11685)|
| 3:14:51| We're giving them the money to fix the building and bring it back to life and put uses in that building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=11691)|
| 3:15:01| So those are the things that we're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=11701)|
| 3:15:04| And again, the TIF is really just about those increased property taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=11704)|
| 3:15:11| It's not about anything but that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=11711)|
| 3:15:13| It's a very, in a sense, simple mechanism that's limited to using those increased tax revenues to pay off a development loan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=11713)|
| 3:15:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=11725)|
| 3:15:26| But I think we want something built in where the county attorneys sign off on whatever you all come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=11726)|
| 3:15:31| Because we need something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=11731)|
| 3:15:32| I think next month when we see some of the audits, if what I'm hearing is true,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=11732)|
| 3:15:38| the way they're written, they may be the pilots, but certainly they're on this list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=11738)|
| 3:15:43| No, these actually, this does not include pilots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=11743)|
| 3:15:47| This just includes the tax increment financing projects that the city and the county have run through KCDC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=11747)|
| 3:15:53| that you all and city council have approved in the last, dates back to, as you can see, September.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=11753)|
| 3:15:58| So all these TIFs, do you all audit them on a yearly basis or anything?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=11758)|
| 3:16:03| Do you, once you provide, once you do your deal, then you don't look back?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=11763)|
| 3:16:08| Well, the bank audits them in a sense because the bank needs that tax revenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=11768)|
| 3:16:13| You know, they're looking for their loan to be repaid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=11773)|
| 3:16:16| And so it happens that since the county, the taxpayers, the city taxpayers, as John explained, are not on the hook.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=11776)|
| 3:16:26| The developers are on the hook.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=11786)|
| 3:16:28| And so that relationship between the bank and the developers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=11788)|
| 3:16:32| I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=11792)|
| 3:16:33| But, like, we've given $20 million, $20 million in downtown on Gay Street, it looks like, or Jackson, Brown Low School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=11793)|
| 3:16:44| And you're saying after this is done, nobody ever goes back for these guys that promised us jobs, sales tax revenue, or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=11804)|
| 3:16:54| Nobody ever goes back and looks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=11814)|
| 3:16:55| So we have no clue if we've created new jobs or just switched jobs or a construction company just moves their people from here to there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=11815)|
| 3:17:03| And there's really no jobs, but nobody cares because what you're telling me is it's just about getting the buildings fixed up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=11823)|
| 3:17:09| Well, Commissioner Moore, as I said, jobs are an ancillary benefit to TIFs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=11829)|
| 3:17:14| PILOT is a separate tool where jobs are primary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=11834)|
| 3:17:17| For this tool, the restoration of the buildings and bringing those buildings back to life and on the tax rolls is primary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=11837)|
| 3:17:24| So what this chart tells you is not so much, as Commissioner Lambert said, what's been given up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=11844)|
| 3:17:32| These numbers were never possible without the TIFs that made the projects possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=11852)|
| 3:17:38| And so, you know, the other way to look at it, which I think is the more correct way to look at it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=11858)|
| 3:17:43| is to look at the increasing numbers in these three gray columns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=11863)|
| 3:17:48| The pre-development county taxes, the taxes that the county received during the TIF period,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=11868)|
| 3:17:54| and then those post-TIF period taxes that the county will receive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=11874)|
| 3:18:00| So as you can see, there's no negative slope there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=11880)|
| 3:18:03| It goes from one period, then it goes up, and then it goes up again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=11883)|
| 3:18:10| Commissioner Pinkston?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=11890)|
| 3:18:12| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=11892)|
| 3:18:13| Who is the 500 block LLC?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=11893)|
| 3:18:17| That's four individuals, me, my partner Mike Hatcher, Tim Hill, and Dane Baker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=11897)|
| 3:18:22| Well, that's what I thought, but I keep hearing putting it on the tax rolls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=11902)|
| 3:18:26| Why aren't you paying taxes on this property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=11906)|
| 3:18:28| We just acquired it July 11th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=11908)|
| 3:18:31| Who owned it before that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=11911)|
| 3:18:33| The city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=11913)|
| 3:18:34| The city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=11914)|
| 3:18:35| What did they pay for this, Mr. Peterson, the city, when they bought the property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=11915)|
| 3:18:41| Actually, the county actually purchased this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=11921)|
| 3:18:46| This is the site that was going to be the Justice Center many moons ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=11926)|
| 3:18:51| Oh, this is part of the State Street property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=11931)|
| 3:18:53| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=11933)|
| 3:18:54| This is the one before when it was going to be up on Gay Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=11934)|
| 3:18:56| I mean, but it was in that, all for the Justice Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=11936)|
| 3:18:59| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=11939)|
| 3:19:02| Commissioner Pinkston, this property was actually traded to the city in exchange for the new Sentinel site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=11942)|
| 3:19:09| Oh, this is a property we traded for the new Sentinel site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=11949)|
| 3:19:15| You've lost me there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=11955)|
| 3:19:16| I thought the new Sentinel site, I thought, was traded to the city for the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=11956)|
| 3:19:22| This is part of the Justice Center site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=11962)|
| 3:19:24| We traded the S&W.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=11964)|
| 3:19:27| The city took the S&W.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=11967)|
| 3:19:29| Then we took the old new Sentinel site, which we put the RFP out for, for the new project development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=11969)|
| 3:19:39| Follow that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=11979)|
| 3:19:44| Where the new Sentinel used to be was a city-owned site when they cut the pilot to send the new Sentinel on the Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=11984)|
| 3:19:53| Knox County had purchased a block of property for the new Justice Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=11993)|
| 3:19:57| We traded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=11997)|
| 3:19:59| We still have a big piece of that property, which we now refer to the State Street site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=11999)|
| 3:20:04| which is now we have a temporary parking lot and, I think, some recycling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=12004)|
| 3:20:09| But the piece that was on Gay Street, where the S&W, we had purchased that as part of the Justice Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=12009)|
| 3:20:15| We flipped.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=12015)|
| 3:20:17| We gave the city and the County Commission approved this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=12017)|
| 3:20:20| We gave the city the S&W site, and we took the old new Sentinel site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=12020)|
| 3:20:25| Then we put an RFP out for the new Sentinel, which you approved a couple years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=12025)|
| 3:20:30| that I think Rajon Talbot and a bunch of them put together a package for a tower with some residential piece.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=12030)|
| 3:20:37| So the piece of property we had that was the old new Sentinel site was put out in RFP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=12037)|
| 3:20:43| What did we pay for this property when we bought it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=12043)|
| 3:20:45| Do you remember?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=12045)|
| 3:20:49| It was about eight years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=12049)|
| 3:20:52| I don't know how much we paid specifically for that property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=12052)|
| 3:20:55| but I know we put together a whole we bought property from four or five different property owners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=12055)|
| 3:21:01| to put together enough property for the Justice Center site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=12061)|
| 3:21:04| We could find that out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=12064)|
| 3:21:05| What did we sell the Sentinel property for?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=12065)|
| 3:21:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=12068)|
| 3:21:14| I think that was right at $800,000, but it was part of the RFP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=12074)|
| 3:21:19| It was part of the RFP process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=12079)|
| 3:21:26| Are you finished, Commissioner Pinkston?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=12086)|
| 3:21:28| I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=12088)|
| 3:21:29| The more I talk, the more confused I get.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=12089)|
| 3:21:32| Commissioner Campion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=12092)|
| 3:21:33| I wanted to call for a question, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=12093)|

| 3:21:45| Mr. Pinkston?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=12105)|
| 3:21:46| Now this is with the amendment, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=12106)|
| 3:21:47| No, this is just a call for the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=12107)|
| 3:21:50| Then we would go to the substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=12110)|
| 3:21:53| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=12113)|

| 3:23:20| Call for the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=12200)|
| 3:23:21| Does it not take?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=12201)|
| 3:23:22| We got one out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=12202)|

| 3:23:47| We're on the substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=12227)|
| 3:23:49| If they would repeat the substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=12229)|
| 3:23:52| Motion is to give them the TIF, 15 years, and the contract has to be signed off by the Knox County Law Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=12232)|

| 3:25:11| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=12311)|
| 3:25:12| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=12312)|
| 3:25:22| Motion failed 4-14.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=12322)|
| 3:25:25| Now we have the original motion of 20 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=12325)|
| 3:25:30| Again, I'm going to ask that the original motion we're on now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=12330)|
| 3:25:34| if it will add the amendment to have the approval of the law department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=12334)|
| 3:25:42| I think that's what we're back to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=12342)|
| 3:25:45| I don't think there was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=12345)|
| 3:25:46| I think that's what we were talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=12346)|
| 3:25:48| There wasn't an original motion, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=12348)|
| 3:25:50| No, that was a substitute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=12350)|
| 3:25:51| There was an original motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=12351)|
| 3:25:53| Commissioner Pinkston made it, and you seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=12353)|
| 3:25:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=12357)|
| 3:25:58| He tried to withdraw it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=12358)|
| 3:25:59| You wouldn't let him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=12359)|
| 3:26:00| So we're back to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=12360)|
| 3:26:02| Is everyone clear?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=12362)|
| 3:26:06| So, Commissioner Pinkston, would you agree to having the law department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=12366)|
| 3:26:10| having to have their approval?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=12370)|
| 3:26:14| I'd take that amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=12374)|
| 3:26:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=12375)|
| 3:26:16| And I guess, Mr. McKenzie, if you'd accept it as a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=12376)|
| 3:26:19| I just have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=12379)|
| 3:26:22| I know you're not KCDC's legal, but is that really doable for this particular one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=12382)|
| 3:26:32| What I don't want to do is for us to do something today that delays this process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=12392)|
| 3:26:36| and it gets wound up into this lawyers talking to lawyers while we hash this out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=12396)|
| 3:26:42| I think this is a good thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=12402)|
| 3:26:44| But for this particular project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=12404)|
| 3:26:45| it sounds like Commissioner Luthor has had a really good conversation with Alvin| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=12405)|
| 3:26:51| and Bill Lyons, and I think I like a lot of those elements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=12411)|
| 3:26:56| So maybe we can incorporate that going forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=12416)|
| 3:26:59| But in your estimation, do you think this will slow this project down significantly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=12419)|
| 3:27:07| I don't mean a day or two, but weeks to months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=12427)|
| 3:27:10| No, not if we get the documents in a timely fashion with the necessary exhibits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=12430)|
| 3:27:15| Is that something that you feel that you all can do for their approval, for our approval?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=12435)|
| 3:27:24| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=12444)|
| 3:27:26| Okay, well, yes, I'll accept it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=12446)|
| 3:27:32| Do you still have your light on, Commissioner Lambert?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=12452)|
| 3:27:35| We have a substitute motion, original motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=12455)|
| 3:27:39| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=12459)|
| 3:27:40| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=12460)|
| 3:27:41| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=12461)|
| 3:27:42| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=12462)|
| 3:27:43| How many no's?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=12463)|
| 3:27:45| Three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=12465)|
| 3:27:48| Two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=12468)|
| 3:27:50| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=12470)|
| 3:27:54| Motion passed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=12474)|
| 3:27:55| It's not you, John.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=12475)|
| 3:27:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=12477)|
| 3:28:01| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=12481)|
| 3:28:02| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=12482)|
| 3:28:07| Good luck with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=12487)|
| 3:28:13| Mr. Chairman, could we take like five minutes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=12493)|
| 3:28:15| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=12495)|
| 3:28:16| I'm with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=12496)|
| 3:28:18| We've got some older gentlemen here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=12498)|
| 3:28:21| Let them do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=12501)|
| 3:28:26| 904.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=12506)|
| 3:28:27| He's not a gentleman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=12507)|
| 3:28:28| 904 is requiring the Knox County Health Department to provide notification to the citizens of Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=12508)|
| 3:28:34| when mosquito abatement vehicles will be spraying in their neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=12514)|
| 3:28:40| Intergovernmental.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=12520)|
| 3:28:41| I'm sorry, you're going to have to tell me which number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=12521)|
| 3:28:43| 904.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=12523)|
| 3:28:46| Mosquitoes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=12526)|
| 3:28:49| 8-0.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=12529)|
| 3:28:50| No recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=12530)|
| 3:28:51| Finance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=12531)|
| 3:28:52| Finance failed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=12532)|
| 3:28:53| 2-8.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=12533)|
| 3:28:55| The reason why was the Health Department made it clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=12535)|
| 3:29:00| Is that not correct, Mr. Campin?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=12540)|
| 3:29:02| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=12542)|
| 3:29:04| I thought you withdrew that, really.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=12544)|
| 3:29:07| I don't recall if it was withdrawn or not, but if you would, Mr. Chairman, I could say a few things about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=12547)|
| 3:29:15| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=12555)|
| 3:29:17| I've got to apologize to Ronnie and Mark for keeping you all here this long and pulling you into this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=12557)|
| 3:29:22| I appreciate your patience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=12562)|
| 3:29:24| I've talked with them, and they're going to come down, but while they're walking down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=12564)|
| 3:29:26| I wanted to just say a few things for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=12566)|
| 3:29:28| I think I am going to withdraw this on these conditions, and they'll explain what they are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=12568)|
| 3:29:36| I mean, I think you all understand the reason why I proposed this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=12576)|
| 3:29:39| and if you looked at the background information on the EPA classifying this as a carcinogen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=12579)|
| 3:29:46| and a neurotoxin and the other safety issues with this chemical| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=12586)|
| 3:29:51| and its application being severely impacts on aquatic insects and fish and that kind of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=12591)|
| 3:29:57| But basically, the goal was to notify citizens of this chemical| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=12597)|
| 3:30:04| and that they have the right to opt out of the program on an individual basis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=12604)|
| 3:30:09| and maybe a community homeowner association basis, that kind of thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=12609)|
| 3:30:13| and talked with Mark and Ronnie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=12613)|
| 3:30:16| This is what they've come up with, if you don't mind coming and saying a few words.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=12616)|
| 3:30:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=12623)|
| 3:30:24| I'm Ronnie Neese, the Director of Environmental Health for Knox County Health Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=12624)|
| 3:30:28| Since we discussed this last week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=12628)|
| 3:30:30| we have been able to develop some partnerships with our utility districts in Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=12630)|
| 3:30:36| where we will be able to place notification in the billing statements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=12636)|
| 3:30:41| that will be going out in the preceding months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=12641)|
| 3:30:46| We also will continue to work with our website to make that more user friendly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=12646)|
| 3:30:51| We'll be looking at other options of placing it in local newspapers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=12651)|
| 3:30:56| any place that we can find that we can do this at no additional cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=12656)|
| 3:31:02| Yeah, I know it's a significant number, some $50,000 possibly, to notify people individually,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=12662)|
| 3:31:08| and I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=12668)|
| 3:31:10| I know it's not a popular thing with the recent West Nile virus found in East Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=12670)|
| 3:31:15| but I do think it's important, and if you are willing to notify via those media outlets| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=12675)|
| 3:31:22| and whatnot, the bills with the utilities, I really appreciate that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=12682)|
| 3:31:25| and let people know, like you did in the article, that they have a phone number to call| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=12685)|
| 3:31:30| and they can opt out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=12690)|
| 3:31:31| We'll be happy to do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=12691)|
| 3:31:32| and we'll continue to work to try and improve our notification system as we go forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=12692)|
| 3:31:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=12697)|
| 3:31:38| Thank you, Ronnie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=12698)|
| 3:31:39| And having said that, I will withdraw this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=12699)|
| 3:31:47| Granted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=12707)|
| 3:31:53| We still have a long way to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=12713)|
| 3:31:56| We do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=12716)|
| 3:32:02| What's a quick break?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=12722)|
| 3:32:03| If I say five minutes, it takes 20.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=12723)|
| 3:32:06| Could I have the law department just announce what I would say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=12726)|
| 3:32:13| just so that this whole body will understand about the call for a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=12733)|
| 3:32:20| Question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=12740)|
| 3:32:21| It is a two-thirds vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=12741)|
| 3:32:23| Robert's Rules of Order does say that a call for the question is a two-thirds vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=12743)|
| 3:32:27| I stand corrected on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=12747)|
| 3:32:29| And I think that we've been doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=12749)|
| 3:32:32| I think we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=12752)|
| 3:32:33| It's late, and I forgive that last call did meet that requirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=12753)|
| 3:32:39| I had a blip on my law license there for a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=12759)|
| 3:32:42| Five-minute break.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=12762)|
| 3:32:50| Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=12770)|
| 3:33:09| That's the best one I've been to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=12789)|
| 3:33:36| Well, 9-0-9, isn't it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=12816)|
| 3:34:02| Legislation 9-0-9 is amending the fiscal year 2008-2009 Knox County budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=12842)|
| 3:34:07| to provide an additional $200,000 in contractual funding for Innovation Valley| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=12847)|
| 3:34:14| in quarterly payments of $50,000 subject to county commission's quarterly approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=12854)|
| 3:34:20| That revenue is sufficient.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=12860)|
| 3:34:23| In a governmental?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=12863)|
| 3:34:26| Which one, ma'am?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=12866)|
| 3:34:28| 9-0-9.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=12868)|
| 3:34:31| Right here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=12871)|
| 3:34:32| Who is the sister?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=12872)|
| 3:34:34| Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=12874)|
| 3:34:36| Intergovernmental, no recommendation, 6-3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=12876)|
| 3:34:39| Finance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=12879)|
| 3:34:42| 9-0-8.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=12882)|
| 3:34:43| 10-0, withdraw.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=12883)|
| 3:34:45| No, we're on 9-0-9.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=12885)|
| 3:34:48| Approved with amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=12888)|
| 3:34:49| Approved with amendment, 10-0.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=12889)|
| 3:34:51| Commissioner Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=12891)|
| 3:34:53| Yes, since this went without a recommendation from the Intergovernmental Committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=12893)|
| 3:34:57| I was the one that sponsored this resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=12897)|
| 3:35:00| And it's to add an additional $200,000 to the budget for the Innovation Valley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=12900)|
| 3:35:08| And the reason I wanted to do this was right after Chattanooga obtained the announcement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=12908)|
| 3:35:15| for the Volkswagen factory is I felt that we needed to put these additional funds into the Innovation Valley project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=12915)|
| 3:35:22| simply because it's an investment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=12922)|
| 3:35:25| And we have the opportunity here with marketing and for other mechanisms that they use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=12925)|
| 3:35:31| to perhaps bring some of these peripheral industries into the Knoxville area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=12931)|
| 3:35:37| I know right now it's a difficult time as far as the budget is concerned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=12937)|
| 3:35:40| But, again, I look at this as an investment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=12940)|
| 3:35:43| It may be a, I'm not going to say a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=12943)|
| 3:35:47| but it certainly, with what's going on down at Chattanooga,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=12947)|
| 3:35:50| it does give us an opportunity to maybe market ourselves and bring more in here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=12950)|
| 3:35:54| which would ultimately increase tax revenues and increase jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=12954)|
| 3:35:59| And these have the potential to be very good jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=12959)|
| 3:36:02| And that's why I'm asking this commission to go ahead and approve this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=12962)|
| 3:36:08| There was an amendment made where we will do this in $50,000 increments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=12968)|
| 3:36:12| and we can look to see what our revenues are as the year goes through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=12972)|
| 3:36:17| So if we do start to run into some financial difficulties, we can stop it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=12977)|
| 3:36:21| But we will do this at $50,000 on a quarterly basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=12981)|
| 3:36:24| And I'm, you know, asking the commission to go ahead and approve this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=12984)|
| 3:36:28| I'm making that in the form of a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=12988)|
| 3:36:30| And I'll make a motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=12990)|
| 3:36:32| I'll second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=12992)|
| 3:36:34| Commissioner Moore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=12994)|
| 3:36:35| Yeah, Commissioner Briggs, what's going to be, how are we going to determine the revenue is significant?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=12995)|
| 3:36:42| I mean, is there a number that we're looking for?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=13002)|
| 3:36:44| I don't think there's a specific number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=13004)|
| 3:36:46| See, one of the things that we're going to be doing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=13006)|
| 3:36:49| and I know that I've talked with Commissioner Pinkston about this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=13009)|
| 3:36:53| and I've talked about it with John Troyer also,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=13013)|
| 3:36:56| is we're going to be trying to monitor, at least on a monthly basis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=13016)|
| 3:37:00| whether in particular the option tax revenues are meeting budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=13020)|
| 3:37:05| And, of course, with some of these other issues that's come up tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=13025)|
| 3:37:08| where we may have some additional expenses, we'll have to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=13028)|
| 3:37:12| in collaboration with the finance department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=13032)|
| 3:37:15| does it look like we're going to be hitting our benchmarks?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=13035)|
| 3:37:19| And if we start to get to mid-year, then we may have to extend the hiring freeze throughout the year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=13039)|
| 3:37:27| And then, you know, really what we'll do then is we'll have new budget projections after they do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=13047)|
| 3:37:32| And I think if we start to run into trouble, this is something where we could cut back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=13052)|
| 3:37:36| But, again, this is an investment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=13056)|
| 3:37:38| This is not something that's maybe something that's frivolous or nice or easy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=13058)|
| 3:37:44| This is actually just a hard investment in jobs and tax dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=13064)|
| 3:37:49| and future investment in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=13069)|
| 3:37:51| So are you saying if we hit projections and we can give the money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=13071)|
| 3:37:55| if we don't hit projections, we're not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=13075)|
| 3:37:57| I think what we'll do is that we'll plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=13077)|
| 3:38:00| What my intention would be is for us to we're going to plan on giving this money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=13080)|
| 3:38:05| and only if we came, if the finance director came back to us and said we're just not going to make it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=13085)|
| 3:38:12| and we're going to have to dip further and further into the general fund, you know, we might not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=13092)|
| 3:38:17| But I think even then, this is an investment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=13097)|
| 3:38:19| This is something that it's like investing in an education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=13099)|
| 3:38:23| It's like investing in a home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=13103)|
| 3:38:25| It's something that you do dip into your savings for because we have the opportunity to derive a lot more benefit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=13105)|
| 3:38:32| than from what we put into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=13112)|
| 3:38:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=13114)|
| 3:38:35| Is it in your proposal that the commission is going to vote on every 50,000?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=13115)|
| 3:38:39| I think they do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=13119)|
| 3:38:40| It was actually an amendment made by Commissioner Hammond that we do look at this on a quarterly basis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=13120)|
| 3:38:46| and I think that was my recollection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=13126)|
| 3:38:48| Yes, it will be voted on quarterly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=13128)|
| 3:38:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=13130)|
| 3:38:51| John Troyer, what's the administration's stance on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=13131)|
| 3:38:59| The mayor, I had a conversation with the mayor about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=13139)|
| 3:39:01| He certainly supports economic development efforts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=13141)|
| 3:39:04| Certainly right now is the time to do what we can on economic activities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=13144)|
| 3:39:10| Certainly the mayor agrees with the purpose of Innovation Valley being a good economic tool.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=13150)|
| 3:39:16| He does share a concern with changing the budget this early in the year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=13156)|
| 3:39:22| So is that an approval or not an approval?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=13162)|
| 3:39:24| What's the administration want?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=13164)|
| 3:39:28| So, you know, it's a good economic tool.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=13168)|
| 3:39:32| We agree with the concept and we're concerned about changing the budget this far in the year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=13172)|
| 3:39:36| We're not opposed to coming back and making reports during the year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=13176)|
| 3:39:46| We have a motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=13186)|
| 3:39:47| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=13187)|
| 3:39:49| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=13189)|
| 3:39:50| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=13190)|
| 3:39:51| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=13191)|
| 3:39:53| One no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=13193)|
| 3:39:57| It passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=13197)|
| 3:40:02| Next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=13202)|
| 3:40:05| Just so we know what we're talking about, we're saying the next 50,000 will start October 1 if it's available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=13205)|
| 3:40:12| So will it be July, August, September?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=13212)|
| 3:40:17| It will be now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=13217)|
| 3:40:18| The first 50,000 will be now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=13218)|
| 3:40:22| I guess, let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=13222)|
| 3:40:24| So you're approving an additional 50,000 tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=13224)|
| 3:40:27| We just want to know when you want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=13227)|
| 3:40:28| No, it was my understanding this would go into effect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=13228)|
| 3:40:30| The first one would be October, whenever the first quarter would be over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=13230)|
| 3:40:33| We'll start with second quarter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=13233)|
| 3:40:34| So October 1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=13234)|
| 3:40:36| So we'll look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=13236)|
| 3:40:37| So we'll put on the agenda in the October agenda meeting a $50,000 additional funding to Innovation Valley, Inc.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=13237)|
| 3:40:50| and let you approve it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=13250)|
| 3:40:53| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=13253)|
| 3:40:54| We just want to make sure we know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=13254)|
| 3:40:55| Based upon the numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=13255)|
| 3:40:58| Mike, would it not be the last would be the end of September because October 1 would be the start of a new quarter, would it not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=13258)|
| 3:41:07| That's what I'm asking you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=13267)|
| 3:41:08| We'll do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=13268)|
| 3:41:09| So the end of the quarter would be September.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=13269)|
| 3:41:14| So our September meeting, we'd have to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=13274)|
| 3:41:16| Otherwise, when we get back to the end of the year, we'd be behind by a month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=13276)|
| 3:41:22| July, August, September, that's our first quarter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=13282)|
| 3:41:25| It sounds like it would have to come to us at the September meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=13285)|
| 3:41:28| September meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=13288)|
| 3:41:33| Resolution 911 is amending the fiscal year 2008-2009 Knox County budget to provide $50,000 in funding for Knoxville area project access.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=13293)|
| 3:41:46| Intergovernmental?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=13306)|
| 3:41:48| Intergovernmental voted to defer for 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=13308)|
| 3:41:52| Finance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=13312)|
| 3:41:53| N-O to withdraw.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=13313)|
| 3:41:54| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=13314)|
| 3:41:55| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=13315)|
| 3:41:56| If we could just wanted to defer this, we can make a substitute motion to defer for 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=13316)|
| 3:42:06| John Troyer, we had talked about some things that we were going to try to do at the health department to help out the Knoxville area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=13326)|
| 3:42:17| Mr. Jones has been working with the Knox area project access, and he's putting together a plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=13337)|
| 3:42:23| We certainly agree with the importance of the proposal and trying to work within the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=13343)|
| 3:42:29| So when do you think that you will have that agreement worked out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=13349)|
| 3:42:37| How long do you think?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=13357)|
| 3:42:39| Mr. Jones hopes that it will be for the August meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=13359)|
| 3:42:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=13361)|
| 3:42:44| We may be changing this from needing money to approving this contract,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=13364)|
| 3:42:49| so I'm just going to ask for a 30-day deferral so that we have that report back from the health department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=13369)|
| 3:42:56| We have a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=13376)|
| 3:42:58| I'm just doing it as a motion to defer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=13378)|
| 3:43:00| I'll second that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=13380)|
| 3:43:01| We have a substitute motion to defer for 30 days with a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=13381)|
| 3:43:05| Mr. Briggs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=13385)|
| 3:43:06| I just want to announce that I'm going to recuse myself from this since I'm the president of the Knoxville Academy of Medicine next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=13386)|
| 3:43:20| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=13400)|
| 3:43:21| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=13401)|
| 3:43:23| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=13403)|
| 3:43:24| And we have one abstaining.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=13404)|
| 3:43:27| So it passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=13407)|
| 3:43:28| Commissioner Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=13408)|
| 3:43:30| Next from Clark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=13410)|
| 3:43:32| Resolution 912 is to sever the public building authority's responsibility for security from the Knox County Public Library System,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=13412)|
| 3:43:41| Knox County Senior Citizens, and the Knox County Health Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=13421)|
| 3:43:45| Intergovernmental?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=13425)|
| 3:43:46| Voted 9-0, no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=13426)|
| 3:43:49| Finance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=13429)|
| 3:43:50| No, no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=13430)|
| 3:43:55| Commissioner DeFries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=13435)|
| 3:43:56| Yes, I'd like to make a motion to approve this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=13436)|
| 3:44:02| I contacted the Knox County Health Department this week, or maybe it was last week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=13442)|
| 3:44:07| and they told me that they only have the cameras that are operated by public building authority,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=13447)|
| 3:44:15| that they actually have hired their own security.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=13455)|
| 3:44:20| I know that out of all of the Knox County Public Libraries, there's 19 of them in all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=13460)|
| 3:44:25| Only two of them have security.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=13465)|
| 3:44:29| I know that the Knox Senior Centers don't have any security,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=13469)|
| 3:44:32| so I just make a motion that we sever public building authority's responsibility for security from the Knox County Public Library System,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=13472)|
| 3:44:39| Knox County Senior Centers, and the Knox County Health Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=13479)|
| 3:44:43| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=13483)|
| 3:44:45| I have a motion to approve with a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=13485)|
| 3:44:50| Commissioner Roundtree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=13490)|
| 3:44:52| Yeah, there are some folks here that have been here from PBA for a long time that might want to come speak to this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=13492)|
| 3:44:57| but I have a, and you all don't have a copy of this, but we discussed this last month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=13497)|
| 3:45:06| especially with regards to the East Tennessee History Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=13506)|
| 3:45:12| I don't know that we actually discussed the branch libraries,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=13512)|
| 3:45:15| but there are alarms installed in all the branches of the Knox County Libraries, intrusion alarms and fire alarm systems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=13515)|
| 3:45:24| So to say that there are no alarm systems in those facilities is incorrect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=13524)|
| 3:45:31| And I also talked to Mark Jones, the director of the Knox County Health Department, today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=13531)|
| 3:45:39| to inquire if there had been some change in his desire for a level of service at his buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=13539)|
| 3:45:46| And he told me that he was completely satisfied with the security systems that the public building authority was managing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=13546)|
| 3:45:55| And we talked last month about several things with PBA, mowing, cleaning, window washing, security.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=13555)|
| 3:46:05| And I just again want to emphasize to you all that I don't think security is something that we need to be messing with here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=13565)|
| 3:46:13| We've got millions and millions of dollars worth of artifacts in that East Tennessee History Center up there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=13573)|
| 3:46:20| and I am not going to vote for anything that would jeopardize the security or safety of those very important pieces of East Tennessee history.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=13580)|
| 3:46:32| You wanted PBA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=13592)|
| 3:46:33| Do you have a question for Dale?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=13593)|
| 3:46:35| No, Dale, do you want to mention anything?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=13595)|
| 3:46:39| Well, just to go add to what Bob just mentioned, in total there are about close to 70 cameras associated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=13599)|
| 3:46:50| Thirty-two of those are at East Tennessee and another 32 at the health department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=13610)|
| 3:46:57| Those cameras are all monitored by our comm center down here at CCB.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=13617)|
| 3:47:01| In effect, you don't pay anything extra to us for doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=13621)|
| 3:47:06| We have about 200 cameras monitored in our comm center downstairs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=13626)|
| 3:47:11| In total, there's over 40 intrusion alarms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=13631)|
| 3:47:16| Every one of these buildings except two senior centers have intrusion alarms in them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=13636)|
| 3:47:23| and, in fact, we're in the process of adding intrusion alarms in those two senior centers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=13643)|
| 3:47:28| Again, our comm center monitors those intrusion alarms, but there's no additional cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=13648)|
| 3:47:34| If you sever this, or even if you want to contemplate it, my suggestion would be take the total scope of what we do in security,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=13654)|
| 3:47:45| bid it out, see what you get, and I guarantee you it will be significant compared to how we're doing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=13665)|
| 3:47:54| We've only got five officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=13674)|
| 3:47:56| Two, I think, is the number you used, associated with Lawson-McGee Library.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=13676)|
| 3:48:01| Three, associated with East Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=13681)|
| 3:48:03| Financially, I think, is a terrible idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=13683)|
| 3:48:07| Financially, you don't know what kind of an idea it is because you're just going to have to take somebody's word for it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=13687)|
| 3:48:14| but if you really are serious about considering it, at least do yourself the courtesy of finding out what your alternative will cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=13694)|
| 3:48:23| I think I mentioned it briefly earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=13703)|
| 3:48:26| You just rebid the mowing contracts that we had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=13706)|
| 3:48:30| They came in $107,000 higher than what PBA's costs for mowing these properties were.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=13710)|
| 3:48:38| So, great, you got it, and you just cost yourselves more money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=13718)|
| 3:48:44| So that would be my suggestion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=13724)|
| 3:48:47| I don't think it's smart to make these decisions based on Mr. Freese's opinion, taking my word for something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=13727)|
| 3:48:54| I would encourage you to go get the data, just like I've suggested before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=13734)|
| 3:49:01| Mr. Anthony, will you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=13741)|
| 3:49:03| I wasn't through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=13743)|
| 3:49:05| You got your light off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=13745)|
| 3:49:07| Well, so I won't leave it on like so many people do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=13747)|
| 3:49:13| Mark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=13753)|
| 3:49:15| Mark Jones, would you come forward, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=13755)|
| 3:49:17| Mark, do you have vaccines stored in some of your facilities that require refrigeration?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=13757)|
| 3:49:25| We do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=13765)|
| 3:49:26| Do you have alarms on those refrigerators?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=13766)|
| 3:49:30| We do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=13770)|
| 3:49:31| And who monitors those?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=13771)|
| 3:49:33| Our staff monitors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=13773)|
| 3:49:35| It's an alarm that goes off 24-7, 365 days a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=13775)|
| 3:49:40| Our staff monitors them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=13780)|
| 3:49:42| When it goes off at night, and it happens fairly regularly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=13782)|
| 3:49:46| you'd be surprised how often our staff has to go in at night and move that vaccine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=13786)|
| 3:49:52| The PBA security, they come down and go with our staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=13792)|
| 3:49:58| Do you have any control substances at your?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=13798)|
| 3:50:01| We do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=13801)|
| 3:50:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=13802)|
| 3:50:03| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=13803)|
| 3:50:05| Here, Mr. Chairman, I'll turn my light off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=13805)|
| 3:50:09| We want him hauled in here right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=13809)|
| 3:50:15| Are you through?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=13815)|
| 3:50:18| Commissioner McKenzie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=13818)|
| 3:50:19| I was wondering what you was waiting on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=13819)|
| 3:50:22| You know, safety and security is one of those things that it's a dynamic non-event, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=13822)|
| 3:50:29| and it always makes for seemingly easy pickings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=13829)|
| 3:50:35| I don't think, and Mr. Smith can comment on that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=13835)|
| 3:50:39| we haven't had any significant break-ins or anything of that nature as far as our archives and properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=13839)|
| 3:50:47| Is that a true statement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=13847)|
| 3:50:50| We have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=13850)|
| 3:50:52| That generally is a very true statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=13852)|
| 3:50:54| We've had some thefts off of, like, air conditioning units on top of buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=13854)|
| 3:50:59| I think there was a small break-in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=13859)|
| 3:51:01| But as far as getting, kind of getting to the stuff that matters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=13861)|
| 3:51:04| In terms of the health department, in terms of East Tennessee and that, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=13864)|
| 3:51:07| I mean, you know, even, like, the Beck Center and the libraries, they don't have cameras.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=13867)|
| 3:51:14| In the branch libraries, it's just intrusion alarms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=13874)|
| 3:51:17| Yeah, intrusion alarms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=13877)|
| 3:51:18| So they've been pretty effective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=13878)|
| 3:51:20| But, you know, again, it's one of those things that I think we sometimes like to throw rocks at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=13880)|
| 3:51:25| or point fingers at when we're talking about savings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=13885)|
| 3:51:28| So I think that's very dangerous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=13888)|
| 3:51:31| I agree with Commissioner Roundtree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=13891)|
| 3:51:33| So I'm going to make a substitute motion that we deny this resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=13893)|
| 3:51:38| I'll second that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=13898)|
| 3:51:42| We have a substitute motion to deny with a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=13902)|
| 3:51:47| Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=13907)|
| 3:51:49| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=13909)|
| 3:51:51| The health department's included in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=13911)|
| 3:51:53| Mr. Jones, would you like to be responsible for security?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=13913)|
| 3:51:58| If it would include basically we pay you what we're paying PBA for your facilities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=13918)|
| 3:52:04| would you like to be responsible for security| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=13924)|
| 3:52:08| but to have the money that would go toward paying for security at your location?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=13928)|
| 3:52:13| Here, the health department's just a little bit different from every other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=13933)|
| 3:52:18| Our security, there are employees that are at the health department, and they are armed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=13938)|
| 3:52:25| And that's what marks us a little different from the other facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=13945)|
| 3:52:29| We have armed security staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=13949)|
| 3:52:31| I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=13951)|
| 3:52:32| What I'm asking you is you've been included in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=13952)|
| 3:52:35| Do you want to be included in this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=13955)|
| 3:52:37| or would you prefer that PBA continue to take care of your location?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=13957)|
| 3:52:41| I think that's the best situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=13961)|
| 3:52:43| I don't have one complaint about the staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=13963)|
| 3:52:46| His staff monitors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=13966)|
| 3:52:48| We have cameras that before we had cameras in that parking lot, in our lower parking lot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=13968)|
| 3:52:54| we had some criminal activity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=13974)|
| 3:52:56| I don't think we've had one situation since those cameras were installed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=13976)|
| 3:53:00| and since they've been monitored.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=13980)|
| 3:53:02| As long as it's not costing us any more than what Dale says it costs us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=13982)|
| 3:53:07| I'm very happy with the way it's set up right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=13987)|
| 3:53:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=13990)|
| 3:53:11| And, Grant, I'm assuming you're over the person who handles the senior centers, aren't you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=13991)|
| 3:53:18| Isn't that under Office of Neighborhoods?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=13998)|
| 3:53:24| Senior centers are under me, and we're happy with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=14004)|
| 3:53:27| You're happy with what PBA is providing for you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=14007)|
| 3:53:30| And one good example, our new South Knoxville senior center did not have that intrusion security,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=14010)|
| 3:53:36| and it was broken into about a month ago, broke the glass out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=14016)|
| 3:53:39| I think they knew what they were going after,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=14019)|
| 3:53:44| but by the end of the month we're going to have that intrusion security system actually at both the two senior centers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=14024)|
| 3:53:51| that are lacking are South and Corrington.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=14031)|
| 3:53:53| We'll have it both there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=14033)|
| 3:53:54| And just so you understand what Mark Jones was saying, he employs the personnel at his facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=14034)|
| 3:54:04| The surveillance, cameras, security, intrusion system is monitored by PBA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=14044)|
| 3:54:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=14049)|
| 3:54:10| So he has the people, and those people are able to carry guns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=14050)|
| 3:54:14| The surveillance is done by PBA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=14054)|
| 3:54:17| We're happy with all the surveillance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=14057)|
| 3:54:18| You'll never get a complaint from me over people carrying guns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=14058)|
| 3:54:22| If nobody's happy, you can always contract with Lambert Security.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=14062)|
| 3:54:27| You finish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=14067)|
| 3:54:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=14069)|
| 3:54:30| Is there anybody with the library system here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=14070)|
| 3:54:33| I don't see Mr. Frank in the audience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=14073)|
| 3:54:36| He had to go to bed at 10.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=14076)|
| 3:54:38| Does anybody know how he feels about this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=14078)|
| 3:54:41| He feels good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=14081)|
| 3:54:43| He likes PBA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=14083)|
| 3:54:46| No one's here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=14086)|
| 3:54:49| Commissioner Luthor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=14089)|
| 3:54:50| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=14090)|
| 3:54:52| Dale, I've got a question for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=14092)|
| 3:54:55| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=14095)|
| 3:54:56| At Old Cedar Bluff Road, where the health department is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=14096)|
| 3:55:00| you also have the clerk's office, and you also have the trustee's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=14100)|
| 3:55:05| And right now, PBA is providing security for all three of those,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=14105)|
| 3:55:10| although they're in different locations of the same building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=14110)|
| 3:55:13| And I need to know whether or not, because of working for the trustee's office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=14113)|
| 3:55:21| if I have a conflict of interest or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=14121)|
| 3:55:23| because if we cut off the security for the health department out at that location,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=14123)|
| 3:55:31| will that affect the security at the trustee's office part of it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=14131)|
| 3:55:38| I know that they're all three separate, but I'm just trying to make sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=14138)|
| 3:55:43| Well, I'm trying to make sure that if I have a conflict, I'm going to disclose it or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=14143)|
| 3:55:48| I would defer to Ms. Stackhouse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=14148)|
| 3:55:51| What I need to know, if you didn't do security for the health department out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=14151)|
| 3:55:56| would you be able to continue to do security for the trustees?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=14156)|
| 3:56:00| Yes, it would not affect that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=14160)|
| 3:56:02| Then I don't believe that I have a conflict,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=14162)|
| 3:56:04| because I'm not voting on what would affect the trustee's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=14164)|
| 3:56:08| If I might add just two very quick facts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=14168)|
| 3:56:12| I mentioned that the monitoring and the alarms and all that is essentially being done at no extra cost,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=14172)|
| 3:56:18| because I've got to have the people to do the other 130 cameras.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=14178)|
| 3:56:22| We also manage the card reader access control system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=14182)|
| 3:56:26| that you're also wonderfully familiar with since it becomes political fodder during election years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=14186)|
| 3:56:33| But the computer software system that you would have to buy to manage that access control system alone is $15,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=14193)|
| 3:56:44| I've already got it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=14204)|
| 3:56:46| That's what we're using.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=14206)|
| 3:56:47| You would have to go buy that kind of equipment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=14207)|
| 3:56:50| I don't even know where you would buy somebody to monitor 70 cameras,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=14210)|
| 3:56:55| but like I said, it won't be cheap if you do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=14215)|
| 3:57:02| Commissioner DeFries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=14222)|
| 3:57:03| Chairman, I'm just going to withdraw this motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=14223)|
| 3:57:08| We're in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=14228)|
| 3:57:11| Second okay with it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=14231)|
| 3:57:14| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=14234)|
| 3:57:16| Are we on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=14236)|
| 3:57:19| Been withdrawn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=14239)|
| 3:57:23| Resolution 913 is to revoke Raquetta Bones' release by the Knox County Law Director and the Knox County Mayor's Office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=14243)|
| 3:57:33| Intergovernmental?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=14253)|
| 3:57:34| Voted 7-1 to deny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=14254)|
| 3:57:37| Finance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=14257)|
| 3:57:38| 9-1 to withdraw.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=14258)|
| 3:57:41| Do we have a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=14261)|
| 3:57:43| Again, Chairman, I differ in opinion of what was sent to us in the memorandum,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=14263)|
| 3:57:50| but considering that one committee already withdrew this, I'll make a motion to also withdraw this resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=14270)|
| 3:57:59| We need a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=14279)|
| 3:58:00| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=14280)|
| 3:58:01| We don't need a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=14281)|
| 3:58:02| You can accept it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=14282)|
| 3:58:03| Do we have a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=14283)|
| 3:58:06| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=14286)|
| 3:58:07| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=14287)|
| 3:58:08| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=14288)|
| 3:58:09| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=14289)|
| 3:58:10| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=14290)|
| 3:58:18| Page 22, Resolution 917.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=14298)|
| 3:58:22| It's creating a task force to study Knox County's fleet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=14302)|
| 3:58:25| and make recommendations to the Knox County Commission on or before November 1, 2008.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=14305)|
| 3:58:33| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=14313)|
| 3:58:34| Very simply, ladies and gentlemen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=14314)|
| 3:58:36| Mr. Walls is already working on an analysis of our fleet if you've gone to KnoxCounty.org.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=14316)|
| 3:58:40| You've seen that they already have listed as well all of the automobiles and all of the vehicles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=14320)|
| 3:58:44| I'm just suggesting that we form a task force to be headed by Commissioner Mark Harmon| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=14324)|
| 3:58:49| because he obviously put a lot of thought into our fleet, fuel efficiency standards and so forth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=14329)|
| 3:58:54| perhaps another couple of members from the commission to join him| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=14334)|
| 3:58:57| and then make recommendations to us after they have talked with Bruce Weitrich,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=14337)|
| 3:59:02| members of the schools, the sheriff's department and so forth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=14342)|
| 3:59:05| to see if we can come up with some kind of plan for next year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=14345)|
| 3:59:08| A, to possibly reduce the fleet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=14348)|
| 3:59:11| and B, to come up with some type of guidelines or standards that we're looking at as far as fuel efficiency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=14351)|
| 3:59:17| Do you have a make-up of what task force you're looking at?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=14357)|
| 3:59:20| I had thought of three people, Commissioner Harmon to be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=14360)|
| 3:59:23| and I haven't asked Commissioner Harmon, Mark Harmon, to do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=14363)|
| 3:59:26| but I thought he would be the chairperson| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=14366)|
| 3:59:27| and perhaps he would select two other people to serve with him on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=14367)|
| 3:59:32| Two other commissioners?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=14372)|
| 3:59:33| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=14373)|
| 3:59:35| You're not going to be one of them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=14375)|
| 3:59:37| I serve at the pleasure of the chairman, so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=14377)|
| 3:59:39| I thought you said Mark Harmon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=14379)|
| 3:59:46| Commissioner Norman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=14386)|
| 3:59:48| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=14388)|
| 3:59:49| I'd just like to call the commission's attention to also a related issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=14389)|
| 3:59:55| We received a letter July 3rd from Dick Moran,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=14395)|
| 3:59:59| and I thought his willingness to voluntarily reduce the number of vehicles| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=14399)|
| 4:00:05| and convert to a motor pool was a commendable thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=14405)|
| 4:00:08| and I would just like to take note of it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=14408)|
| 4:00:11| and have other department heads take note of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=14411)|
| 4:00:14| that this is an example of leadership and stewardship in this current budget cycle,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=14414)|
| 4:00:19| and we need more of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=14419)|
| 4:00:22| Commissioner Mora?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=14422)|
| 4:00:24| Just for clarification, is there any financial impact?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=14424)|
| 4:00:28| None.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=14428)|
| 4:00:29| This is just recommendations they'll bring back to us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=14429)|
| 4:00:31| and as we're looking to the budget for next year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=14431)|
| 4:00:33| this might be some guidance as to, A, could we reduce our fleet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=14433)|
| 4:00:36| and then also in looking at purchasing new vehicles, looking at fuel efficiency standards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=14436)|
| 4:00:40| types of vehicles that we're getting, those kinds of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=14440)|
| 4:00:43| But, no, there would be no financial impact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=14443)|
| 4:00:46| Commissioner Lambert?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=14446)|
| 4:00:48| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=14448)|
| 4:00:49| I like this idea, and I think that either myself or Mr. Pinkston,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=14449)|
| 4:00:54| someone who's been involved in the automotive business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=14454)|
| 4:00:56| would be a good second to put on this committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=14456)|
| 4:01:00| and I'm willing to do that, and I'm not sure if Mr. Pinkston would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=14460)|
| 4:01:04| Is there anyone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=14464)|
| 4:01:05| Who would like to be on this committee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=14465)|
| 4:01:10| Mr. Lambert?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=14470)|
| 4:01:12| Anyone else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=14472)|
| 4:01:18| I don't know how we're going to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=14478)|
| 4:01:19| I'm not going to select anyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=14479)|
| 4:01:24| If no one else, I'll be happy to join Mr. Lambert and Mr. Harmon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=14484)|
| 4:01:27| If no one else would like to do it, since it was my idea, I'll be happy to join.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=14487)|
| 4:01:30| But I would like for Commissioner Harmon to be the chairperson of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=14490)|
| 4:01:34| You'll check with him?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=14494)|
| 4:01:36| Is that a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=14496)|
| 4:01:38| I'll make that in the form of a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=14498)|
| 4:01:39| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=14499)|
| 4:01:42| Properly moved and seconded that we go with the task force with the three named people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=14502)|
| 4:01:48| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=14508)|
| 4:01:49| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=14509)|
| 4:01:50| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=14510)|
| 4:01:52| We serve two terms now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=14512)|
| 4:01:55| Four-year terms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=14515)|
| 4:02:00| I'm just glad to see Mark Harmon and Lumpy working together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=14520)|
| 4:02:05| I forgot about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=14525)|
| 4:02:09| I'll have him a car sold in a week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=14529)|
| 4:02:14| Ordinance on first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=14534)|
| 4:02:17| Ordinance 101 is consideration to bring the fee office budgets under the control of the Knox County Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=14537)|
| 4:02:27| Intergovernmental?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=14547)|
| 4:02:28| Mr. Chairman, I'm going to recuse myself and let the Vice Chair of Intergovernmental report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=14548)|
| 4:02:33| Intergovernmental was 7-0, no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=14553)|
| 4:02:36| 7-what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=14556)|
| 4:02:37| 7-1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=14557)|
| 4:02:38| 7-0-1-1, no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=14558)|
| 4:02:40| 7-1-1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=14560)|
| 4:02:41| 7-1-1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=14561)|
| 4:02:42| Finance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=14562)|
| 4:02:43| 7-1-2 to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=14563)|
| 4:02:45| I believe we finance you correctly, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=14565)|
| 4:02:49| I believe we got some direction that we didn't have the authority to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=14569)|
| 4:02:53| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=14573)|
| 4:02:55| Over the fee offices?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=14575)|
| 4:02:58| We can't make the fee offices come on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=14578)|
| 4:03:01| I believe there was something come up like that, wasn't there, Mr. Hammond?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=14581)|
| 4:03:05| I think you're correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=14585)|
| 4:03:06| I think Mr. Owings was saying that there is state law that may preclude us from doing this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=14586)|
| 4:03:11| That was his advice to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=14591)|
| 4:03:13| They can do it if they opt to, but they don't have to, I believe, is the way it was stated in the law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=14593)|
| 4:03:20| Of course, they had to file a salary suit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=14600)|
| 4:03:22| I think the question here is whether or not Knox County can trump the salary suit statutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=14602)|
| 4:03:32| And that's another one of those $64,000 questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=14612)|
| 4:03:36| It's true that you've brought the fee offices within the charter as charter animals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=14616)|
| 4:03:41| They're all provided for within the charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=14621)|
| 4:03:43| That happened in November of 2006.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=14623)|
| 4:03:48| It's not as clear whether you can take away the salary suit rights given to those offices under Tennessee law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=14628)|
| 4:04:00| And that would be what you would be attempting to do here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=14640)|
| 4:04:08| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=14648)|
| 4:04:09| How would you be attempting to take away their salary suits?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=14649)|
| 4:04:13| If you bring the fee office budget under the control of the county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=14653)|
| 4:04:17| And, of course, now to some degree you already have done that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=14657)|
| 4:04:21| I mean, every fee office presents its budget to the mayor by May 1st of the year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=14661)|
| 4:04:27| And then, of course, you pass the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=14667)|
| 4:04:30| So on one hand it would appear that the county commission has control over the fee office budgets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=14670)|
| 4:04:38| But the reality is that even though you've passed the budget, every fee office has the right to file a salary suit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=14678)|
| 4:04:47| And, indeed, they do file those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=14687)|
| 4:04:50| Generally speaking, they're resolved and they're not litigated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=14690)|
| 4:04:55| But state law allows every fee office to file a salary suit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=14695)|
| 4:05:00| Where you see that happen in a more contentious arena is if, indeed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=14700)|
| 4:05:04| the county commission were to drastically cut the budget of a fee office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=14704)|
| 4:05:09| say taking away a substantial portion of their staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=14709)|
| 4:05:14| That's when a salary suit would become really meaningful and contentious| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=14714)|
| 4:05:19| and truly litigious because they would be going to court saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=14719)|
| 4:05:24| we need this staff, we need this money put back in our budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=14724)|
| 4:05:29| But state law allows every fee office to file a salary suit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=14729)|
| 4:05:33| And they do file them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=14733)|
| 4:05:34| It's just that they're usually in sync with what the commission's done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=14734)|
| 4:05:38| because the commission has been gracious or generous in its budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=14738)|
| 4:05:44| And doesn't this also kind of marry into what you had talked about with regard to civil service| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=14744)|
| 4:05:51| in that our charter can take precedence over state law because of the Jordan decision, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=14751)|
| 4:06:00| Well, and the charter enabling legislation allows the charter to provide for a civil service system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=14760)|
| 4:06:06| So, you know, it's conceivable that all that could come together under Jordan and sort of sing in harmony.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=14766)|
| 4:06:13| It's just that those that still is an issue about whether we can trump the salary suit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=14773)|
| 4:06:22| It's sort of a $64,000 question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=14782)|
| 4:06:24| I mean, I can't really tell you one way or the other whether you can trump the salary suit rights of fee offices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=14784)|
| 4:06:35| Well, I'm going to make a motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=14795)|
| 4:06:39| Do we have a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=14799)|
| 4:06:43| I'll second it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=14803)|
| 4:06:46| We have a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=14806)|
| 4:06:47| We have a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=14807)|
| 4:06:48| Is there any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=14808)|
| 4:06:50| Yes, I guess question in that, okay, if we pass this tonight, I guess this is to the law director,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=14810)|
| 4:07:00| are we putting ourselves at risk for anything?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=14820)|
| 4:07:06| Oh, everything we do puts us at risk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=14826)|
| 4:07:08| But, you know, I suppose you'll find out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=14828)|
| 4:07:13| You'll do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=14833)|
| 4:07:14| It'll bring the fee office budgets under the control of the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=14834)|
| 4:07:18| This is just first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=14838)|
| 4:07:19| Just first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=14839)|
| 4:07:20| But, I mean, assume it passes down the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=14840)|
| 4:07:22| Then, you know, next year you'll pass a budget, and if you are particularly incisive with a budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=14842)|
| 4:07:33| then someone will sue you and you'll find out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=14853)|
| 4:07:35| And then we end up with $350,000 in legal fees as five people file suit potentially.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=14855)|
| 4:07:41| That could happen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=14861)|
| 4:07:47| Commissioner Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=14867)|
| 4:07:48| Just a quick comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=14868)|
| 4:07:49| You said it was a $64,000 question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=14869)|
| 4:07:51| It may be a bigger question than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=14871)|
| 4:07:53| I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=14873)|
| 4:07:55| Commissioner Pinkston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=14875)|
| 4:07:58| If someone sued, you'd have to represent both of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=14878)|
| 4:08:00| We'd have to hire an outside counsel, wouldn't we, on one side?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=14880)|
| 4:08:04| At least one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=14884)|
| 4:08:05| One to represent commission if we pass this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=14885)|
| 4:08:07| and then one representing the fee office that one of us would have to have outside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=14887)|
| 4:08:13| Well, even right now, the fee offices hire their own counsel for their salary suits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=14893)|
| 4:08:28| Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=14908)|
| 4:08:29| So a couple of times tonight I've deferred to the advice of the Office of the Law Director,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=14909)|
| 4:08:37| and this may put us in peril.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=14917)|
| 4:08:41| Yes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=14921)|
| 4:08:43| I think it could raise a litigation question, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=14923)|
| 4:08:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=14926)|
| 4:08:52| We have a motion on the floor to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=14932)|
| 4:08:55| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=14935)|
| 4:08:57| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=14937)|
| 4:08:58| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=14938)|
| 4:08:59| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=14939)|
| 4:09:02| And put me down as recusal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=14942)|
| 4:09:04| Chair rules that the motion fails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=14944)|
| 4:09:11| Who are the ayes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=14951)|
| 4:09:13| Davis and DeFries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=14953)|
| 4:09:21| Ordinance 102 is amending Article II, Section 2.2,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=14961)|
| 4:09:27| and Article III, Section 3.3 of the Knox County Charter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=14967)|
| 4:09:31| to establish a two-term limit on all members appointed to boards, commissions, and authorities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=14971)|
| 4:09:39| Knox County Charter as adopted, 1188, and amended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=14979)|
| 4:09:45| Any governmental?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=14985)|
| 4:09:46| Voted 9-0 to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=14986)|
| 4:09:48| Finance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=14988)|
| 4:09:49| 10-0 to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=14989)|
| 4:09:50| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=14990)|
| 4:09:52| Do we have a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=14992)|
| 4:09:53| I'll second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=14993)|
| 4:09:55| Any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=14995)|
| 4:09:57| Commissioner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=14997)|
| 4:09:59| I'd just like to ask, when will this take effect?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=14999)|
| 4:10:03| And when are the terms in this year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=15003)|
| 4:10:09| Yes, but I think the way the law director explained it is that when the terms end,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=15009)|
| 4:10:15| the next one will be the first term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=15015)|
| 4:10:18| No, it wasn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=15018)|
| 4:10:19| I think you explained that to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=15019)|
| 4:10:21| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=15021)|
| 4:10:22| This is a prospective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=15022)|
| 4:10:23| It would have prospective future application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=15023)|
| 4:10:26| It would not affect the term of the appointee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=15026)|
| 4:10:30| In the middle of the term that's currently serving, it would have a future application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=15030)|
| 4:10:35| So the next term of the appointee after this goes into effect would be term number one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=15035)|
| 4:10:42| So someone serving not as a commissioner on a board, how would that affect them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=15042)|
| 4:10:48| What's the term?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=15048)|
| 4:10:50| It would be two terms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=15050)|
| 4:10:51| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=15051)|
| 4:10:52| So you have a lot of folks that the commission appoints to boards and committees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=15052)|
| 4:10:57| They'll be two four-year terms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=15057)|
| 4:10:59| Or two two-year terms, depending on the term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=15059)|
| 4:11:01| I mean, you have the merit council and all kinds of boards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=15061)|
| 4:11:04| and some of the terms are two years, some are four years, whatever the term is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=15064)|
| 4:11:12| Commissioner Briggs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=15072)|
| 4:11:15| You know, I agree in principle with this completely,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=15075)|
| 4:11:18| but one of the things that I've noticed is that sometimes we have a difficult time finding people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=15078)|
| 4:11:23| that want to fill these positions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=15083)|
| 4:11:25| And is this a wise thing to do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=15085)|
| 4:11:27| By the time we eliminate some of the people who are willing to serve,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=15087)|
| 4:11:30| are we going to have trouble finding other people that want to serve?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=15090)|
| 4:11:39| We will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=15099)|
| 4:11:43| Commissioner Lutho?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=15103)|
| 4:11:44| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=15104)|
| 4:11:45| Paul, I was wondering, instead of it being two terms, if we could put in like a number of years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=15105)|
| 4:11:52| because like the law director said, some things are just for two years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=15112)|
| 4:11:57| Let's go not over eight years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=15117)|
| 4:11:59| We're term limited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=15119)|
| 4:12:00| Yeah, if you want to make that part of your motion, I think that makes more sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=15120)|
| 4:12:05| You want to put that as a friendly amendment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=15125)|
| 4:12:07| Yeah, I'll make it as a friendly amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=15127)|
| 4:12:08| So it would be two terms or not to exceed eight years?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=15128)|
| 4:12:12| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=15132)|
| 4:12:13| No, I don't think so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=15133)|
| 4:12:15| That's not going to catch it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=15135)|
| 4:12:16| Some boards are six.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=15136)|
| 4:12:18| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=15138)|
| 4:12:20| You probably need to get rid of the term terms and just say an eight-year limit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=15140)|
| 4:12:27| Yeah, but we have some boards that are six years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=15147)|
| 4:12:31| What board would be six years?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=15151)|
| 4:12:33| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=15153)|
| 4:12:34| IDB is six.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=15154)|
| 4:12:36| What is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=15156)|
| 4:12:37| IDB.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=15157)|
| 4:12:41| Six years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=15161)|
| 4:12:42| Well, you could say eight years or two terms, whichever is the greater.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=15162)|
| 4:12:48| I'll accept that as a friendly amendment, eight years or two terms, whichever is the greater.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=15168)|
| 4:12:53| That's good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=15173)|
| 4:12:54| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=15174)|
| 4:12:58| Are you okay with that, Commissioner DeFries?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=15178)|
| 4:13:01| Yes, I am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=15181)|
| 4:13:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=15182)|
| 4:13:04| Anything else, Commissioner Lucco?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=15184)|
| 4:13:06| I'll light off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=15186)|
| 4:13:07| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=15187)|
| 4:13:09| Is everyone clear?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=15189)|
| 4:13:10| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=15190)|
| 4:13:11| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=15191)|
| 4:13:12| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=15192)|
| 4:13:14| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=15194)|
| 4:13:17| We're getting closer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=15197)|
| 4:13:18| We're getting closer, boys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=15198)|
| 4:13:21| Ordinances on second reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=15201)|
| 4:13:23| Ordinance 101 is amending the Knox County Charter to add section 9.18 to Article 9,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=15203)|
| 4:13:31| providing for the maintenance and administration of an effective civil service merit system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=15211)|
| 4:13:36| for any or all Knox County employees in the classified service as determined by the Commission of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=15216)|
| 4:13:46| Intergovernmental?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=15226)|
| 4:13:48| I'm going to have to recuse myself again since this may have implications of where I work with the trustee's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=15228)|
| 4:13:55| I'm going to turn it over to Vice Chairman Mr. Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=15235)|
| 4:14:00| Intergovernmental, no recommendation, 7011.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=15240)|
| 4:14:03| Finance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=15243)|
| 4:14:05| Finance, 10-0, no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=15245)|
| 4:14:08| Yeah, I believe this is another one that the law director talked about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=15248)|
| 4:14:12| We can't bring the fee officers in under this either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=15252)|
| 4:14:15| Is that correct, Ms. Stackhouse?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=15255)|
| 4:14:18| Yeah, this is the one that he spoke of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=15258)|
| 4:14:21| Yeah, we can't bring the fee officers in under this civil service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=15261)|
| 4:14:25| I think that's where I've been hearing the most problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=15265)|
| 4:14:29| Well, I think what I want everyone to understand is that the charter-enabling legislation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=15269)|
| 4:14:35| allows the charter to provide for a civil service system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=15275)|
| 4:14:41| However, whether or not you want this civil service system to apply to the sheriff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=15281)|
| 4:14:49| when he already has a merit system counsel, that's one issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=15289)|
| 4:14:55| Whether creating a civil service system for all the fee officers will then trump the state law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=15295)|
| 4:15:04| that says that those fee officers had the right to opt out of the personnel ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=15304)|
| 4:15:12| and have only certain base policies, I can't completely answer that question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=15312)|
| 4:15:18| because it's not answerable under the present state of the law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=15318)|
| 4:15:23| But I can tell you the charter-enabling legislation allows the charter to provide for a civil service system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=15323)|
| 4:15:29| We have put the fee officers in the charter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=15329)|
| 4:15:33| and we know from Jordan that the Supreme Court seems to have a broad view of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=15333)|
| 4:15:38| But there is still this question of can the fee officers opt out under state law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=15338)|
| 4:15:44| and just have their base policies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=15344)|
| 4:15:47| And I think what you should know is going into this, there's that question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=15347)|
| 4:15:53| Ms. Stackhouse, would the courts be considered a fee officer since they do turn money into the county?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=15353)|
| 4:16:01| No, because the courts are specifically exempt under the charter-enabling legislation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=15361)|
| 4:16:07| from being controlled by the charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=15367)|
| 4:16:10| I realize that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=15370)|
| 4:16:11| I thought that because they didn't turn a limit to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=15371)|
| 4:16:13| So really all we would be bringing in under this would be, if we can make this exist,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=15373)|
| 4:16:19| would be the register of deeds, the county court clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=15379)|
| 4:16:23| County clerk, not court clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=15383)|
| 4:16:26| County clerk and the trustee and the property assessor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=15386)|
| 4:16:30| Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=15390)|
| 4:16:31| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=15391)|
| 4:16:32| Now, the way this reads right now, it still has the sheriff in it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=15392)|
| 4:16:35| so you may want to think about how you want to handle that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=15395)|
| 4:16:39| Well, the merit system is basically the same thing as civil service there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=15399)|
| 4:16:43| It's very similar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=15403)|
| 4:16:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=15407)|
| 4:16:50| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=15410)|
| 4:16:52| Frances, would you come down, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=15412)|
| 4:16:55| A couple of questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=15415)|
| 4:16:57| We talked about the staffing and the cost,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=15417)|
| 4:17:01| and you passed out some information today saying that you felt like the grand total would be $1.7 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=15421)|
| 4:17:08| Are you comfortable with that number?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=15428)|
| 4:17:11| Well, I can say that that is merely an estimate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=15431)|
| 4:17:14| and it's an estimate, as I've said in the notes there, made in the absence of any formal needs assessment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=15434)|
| 4:17:20| I mean, we don't really have the data.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=15440)|
| 4:17:24| We don't know the current status of the offices that this might include.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=15444)|
| 4:17:31| And without certain real data like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=15451)|
| 4:17:34| it's pretty difficult to give you anything more than just an estimate that's based on general assumptions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=15454)|
| 4:17:43| So the assumption that I took was what our current budget is and added 50 percent to it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=15463)|
| 4:17:49| since if we use the city as a model, we would have to increase our staffing to that level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=15469)|
| 4:17:57| Plus it would include the appropriation for the hearing system and then, you know, for appeals and grievances,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=15477)|
| 4:18:05| and then added $200,000 for professional consultation for startup fees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=15485)|
| 4:18:12| but you could easily make a case that that could be considerably higher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=15492)|
| 4:18:17| You've also listed as to who would be included and who wouldn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=15497)|
| 4:18:20| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=15500)|
| 4:18:21| You've got excluded about 1,500 employees, the largest number there being, of course, the Sheriff's Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=15501)|
| 4:18:26| Right, right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=15506)|
| 4:18:27| And all of this is just kind of ambiguous right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=15507)|
| 4:18:31| So I have a list of what my perception was of those that would be included,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=15511)|
| 4:18:36| and that's essentially the executive branch departments, the fee offices, and the county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=15516)|
| 4:18:43| Then the judicial and the court clerks excluded,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=15523)|
| 4:18:46| and then we have that whole grouping of departments that we just don't know because they answer to a board of directors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=15526)|
| 4:18:54| a board of trustees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=15534)|
| 4:18:56| So we've got those that we believe would be included, and if the fee offices aren't in there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=15536)|
| 4:19:01| then it's just the executive branch and the county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=15541)|
| 4:19:06| Thank you for doing this, by the way, and compiling this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=15546)|
| 4:19:08| I guess my comment would be that when we had our hearing, Ms. Cook, is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=15548)|
| 4:19:13| Yes, Barbara Cook.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=15553)|
| 4:19:14| She had appeared before us, and she had said that to implement something like this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=15554)|
| 4:19:18| she encouraged us to look at it very carefully, to not rush into it, to go slowly with it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=15558)|
| 4:19:25| and I think that's good advice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=15565)|
| 4:19:31| Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=15571)|
| 4:19:35| Is there anything that we can do that would achieve the same results?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=15575)|
| 4:19:40| The main thing I'm looking for is I want folks that have been terminated from Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=15580)|
| 4:19:45| that they feel like it has not been a justified termination, or they feel like they've been fired for political reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=15585)|
| 4:19:55| Is there any way that we can give them some recourse without suing the county?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=15595)|
| 4:20:00| Is there any way we could set up some sort of an employment board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=15600)|
| 4:20:04| where maybe some members of this commission could hear complaints?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=15604)|
| 4:20:12| The policies that we have under the Knox County personnel ordinance do allow for a personnel board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=15612)|
| 4:20:19| You know, we have that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=15619)|
| 4:20:20| We have a three-stage appeals process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=15620)|
| 4:20:25| but right now for those departments that have opted out, I'm not sure what your remedy is for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=15625)|
| 4:20:34| Do we have the power to bring them under that system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=15634)|
| 4:20:39| or are the fee offices just untouchable when it comes to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=15639)|
| 4:20:46| Well, the state law allows the fee offices to opt out of the personnel ordinance that this commission passed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=15646)|
| 4:20:56| That's so far what those offices have done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=15656)|
| 4:21:00| When this issue first came up, the reason that our office suggested that it be done as a charter amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=15660)|
| 4:21:07| rather than as an ordinance is because you've got this opt-out thing going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=15667)|
| 4:21:13| At least as a charter amendment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=15673)|
| 4:21:15| since the enabling legislation lets the charter provide for a civil service system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=15675)|
| 4:21:20| then at least as a charter amendment it seemed to us you begin the process on a more sound basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=15680)|
| 4:21:27| Now, that still doesn't completely answer the question whether even after a charter amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=15687)|
| 4:21:32| can these office holders opt out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=15692)|
| 4:21:36| But you have a greater chance of bringing them in if it's a charter amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=15696)|
| 4:21:42| since they are also now charter animals, if you will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=15702)|
| 4:21:47| And so the argument is stronger that they would be governed by the civil service system if it's a charter amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=15707)|
| 4:21:54| But I'm sure some of them would take the view that state law lets them opt out and they want to opt out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=15714)|
| 4:22:00| and you might have a little disagreement on your hands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=15720)|
| 4:22:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=15723)|
| 4:22:04| Could we amend this based on the cost considerations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=15724)|
| 4:22:09| and instead of making a charter amendment with full-blown civil service,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=15729)|
| 4:22:15| could we amend this to where through a charter amendment we put the fee office employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=15735)|
| 4:22:23| under the same protections that the other employees have?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=15743)|
| 4:22:29| Could we do that through a charter amendment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=15749)|
| 4:22:33| Well, what the enabling legislation says is that the charter can provide for a civil service system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=15753)|
| 4:22:40| And so I think that the safer course of action is to use that language.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=15760)|
| 4:22:45| Now, your civil service system can look many different ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=15765)|
| 4:22:49| What this charter amendment says right now is pretty general concepts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=15769)|
| 4:22:54| If the amendment were to pass, then it would come back to this commission for an ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=15774)|
| 4:22:59| that would sort of flesh out how the civil service system would work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=15779)|
| 4:23:04| And if you recall, I think at the last committee meeting, Commissioner Harmon brought up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=15784)|
| 4:23:11| well, you know, you could have a civil service system that was just looking at whether an employment decision was arbitrary or capricious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=15791)|
| 4:23:20| So what you would have at your disposal, if the amendment passed, is then the opportunity to be more specific.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=15800)|
| 4:23:30| So what you're saying is, if I understand right, and it is very late, so my ability to understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=15810)|
| 4:23:36| Well, and my ability to speak is growing dimmer by the day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=15816)|
| 4:23:40| So what you're saying is that if we pass this tonight and then it goes on the ballot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=15820)|
| 4:23:47| that then the citizens choose to have a civil service system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=15827)|
| 4:23:52| that it still comes back to this commission and we can design what that civil service system looks like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=15832)|
| 4:23:58| which would also entail we can design how much that civil service system would cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=15838)|
| 4:24:05| So the numbers that we're throwing around are based on a system that we may well choose not to adopt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=15845)|
| 4:24:15| So I co-sponsored this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=15855)|
| 4:24:19| I have wavered back and forth deciding how I was going to vote on it when I hear these numbers like over a million dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=15859)|
| 4:24:27| But I still stand by this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=15867)|
| 4:24:29| I believe that we can implement something that will give these employees some protection,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=15869)|
| 4:24:35| but at a lot lower cost maybe actually draft their civil service system to look exactly like the system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=15875)|
| 4:24:42| that we're already managing with a lot less money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=15882)|
| 4:24:45| So I still stand behind this, and I hope that folks will not be fooled by the numbers that are being thrown out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=15885)|
| 4:24:52| because that's for a system designed by someone else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=15892)|
| 4:24:56| If this passes and if it passes with the citizens, it will be a system that we ourselves design,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=15896)|
| 4:25:02| and in designing it we can take cost into consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=15902)|
| 4:25:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=15906)|
| 4:25:11| Mr. Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=15911)|
| 4:25:12| I think Elaine was first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=15912)|
| 4:25:16| You've given up your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=15916)|
| 4:25:17| Oh, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=15917)|
| 4:25:18| No, no, her light was on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=15918)|
| 4:25:20| Her light was just on before mine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=15920)|
| 4:25:21| You better start talking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=15921)|
| 4:25:22| I saw you first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=15922)|
| 4:25:23| Okay, well, that's good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=15923)|
| 4:25:24| I'll go ahead if I've got it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=15924)|
| 4:25:26| I guess what I was asking is if we do pass this as part of the civil service system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=15926)|
| 4:25:30| and we attempt to bring the fee offices under this, is that going to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=15930)|
| 4:25:35| it seems like everything we do entails the potential for a lawsuit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=15935)|
| 4:25:38| If one of the fee offices said, we don't want to do this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=15938)|
| 4:25:41| is this something that again gets tied up into the court and becomes another $64,000 question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=15941)|
| 4:25:47| That can happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=15947)|
| 4:25:49| I mean, a fee office could say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=15949)|
| 4:25:52| could take the position that it doesn't believe you have the authority to trump the statute that lets them opt out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=15952)|
| 4:26:03| and I suppose they could bring a lawsuit against the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=15963)|
| 4:26:06| I guess the next question I have is part of the expense that I recall| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=15966)|
| 4:26:11| when we were talking about having a full-fledged civil service system dealt not only with the grievance process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=15971)|
| 4:26:18| but also with the hiring process, which would mean we would be testing people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=15978)|
| 4:26:22| and if we do it like the post office or some of the other civil service people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=15982)|
| 4:26:27| we give people extra points for being disabled, extra points for being veterans and things like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=15987)|
| 4:26:34| which increases the cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=15994)|
| 4:26:36| Is there an alternative to this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=15996)|
| 4:26:38| It seems like many of the concerns that I've had and some of the other people have had,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=15998)|
| 4:26:42| it really deals with just the grievance process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=16002)|
| 4:26:46| Would it not be simpler and maybe avoid some of the cost and some of the other confusion with this if we just,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=16006)|
| 4:26:54| I don't know if we could do it by ordinance or whether it would have to be a charter amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=16014)|
