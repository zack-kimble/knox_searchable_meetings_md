| 0:01:03| to promote the responsible care and welfare of animals with Knox County and the City of Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-2?start=63)|
| 0:01:09| each paying the amount of $1,075,000 for the term of July 1, 2022, through June 30, 2023,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-2?start=69)|

| 0:01:33| Commissioner Ward, your light is on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-2?start=93)|
| 0:01:35| I just would like to ask Councilman Testerman to come up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-2?start=95)|
| 0:01:38| She handed out a packet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-2?start=98)|
| 0:01:39| I would just like you to please go through what you handed out for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-2?start=99)|
| 0:01:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-2?start=105)|
| 0:01:46| Janet Testerman, 3201 Division Street, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37919.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-2?start=106)|
| 0:01:55| I want to thank all of you for your consideration of Young-Williams Animal Center's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-2?start=115)|
| 0:01:59| annual defined services agreement to continue our contract as the municipal shelter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-2?start=119)|
| 0:02:04| for both Knox County and the City of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-2?start=124)|
| 0:02:09| I hope you received the information that was sent to you earlier today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-2?start=129)|
| 0:02:12| as well as I gave you a hard copy this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-2?start=132)|
| 0:02:16| And the same as what was sent via email.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-2?start=136)|
| 0:02:20| Young-Williams has grown substantially over the last five years and since become| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-2?start=140)|
| 0:02:24| the largest animal welfare organization in the state,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-2?start=144)|
| 0:02:28| both by our intake numbers and our expense budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-2?start=148)|
| 0:02:32| And in that period, we've nearly doubled our employee count to almost 100| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-2?start=152)|
| 0:02:37| and grown our budget by $3 million to $6.8 million with consecutive years of positive net income.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-2?start=157)|
| 0:02:44| Six years ago, Young-Williams had 11,594 animals come through our doors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-2?start=164)|
| 0:02:51| We ended that year with a 62% save rate, which means 3,966 animals were humanely euthanized,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-2?start=171)|
| 0:03:00| the majority of who would have been classified as behaviorally or medically treatable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-2?start=180)|
| 0:03:06| This reality, which included year after year of compassion fatigue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-2?start=186)|
| 0:03:10| and an incredible mental and emotional toll on our team,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-2?start=190)|
| 0:03:14| motivated us to set a goal to achieve no-kill status defined by 90% or above by 2020.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-2?start=194)|
| 0:03:23| So by shifting mindsets, implementing shelter best practices,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-2?start=203)|
| 0:03:27| and building a dedicated team committed to our life-saving efforts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-2?start=207)|
| 0:03:31| we achieved no-kill status two years ahead of schedule, ending 2018 with a 90.47 save rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-2?start=211)|
| 0:03:39| This year, we're on track to rival 2016's intake number of that 11,594.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-2?start=219)|
| 0:03:47| The difference is, with a 93% save rate, we would be saving 3,154 more animals' lives| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-2?start=227)|
| 0:03:56| than we did just six years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-2?start=236)|
| 0:03:58| I hope that exemplifies to you our hard work and our commitment to being a model agency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-2?start=238)|
| 0:04:05| To clarify a couple of questions brought up at last week's work session,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-2?start=245)|
| 0:04:09| I'd like to set the record straight on the following.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-2?start=249)|
| 0:04:13| Regarding the claim that Young-Williams went on emergency only 20 times in 60 days is simply not true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-2?start=253)|
| 0:04:20| The only times we requested emergency only was August 9th through 11th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-2?start=260)|
| 0:04:26| The second time was August 25th through 28th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-2?start=266)|
| 0:04:30| when we had to shut down a dog holding room to treat four Parvo positive dogs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-2?start=270)|
| 0:04:35| And that compromised our available kennel space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-2?start=275)|
| 0:04:38| During this time period, however, both city and county animal control put themselves on emergency only| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-2?start=278)|
| 0:04:44| because of staffing shortages, including this past weekend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-2?start=284)|
| 0:04:50| At no point in July did Young-Williams go on emergency only,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-2?start=290)|
| 0:04:52| and despite being at capacity the last two weeks, we have not gone on emergency status,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-2?start=292)|
| 0:04:57| and it is always a last resort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-2?start=297)|
| 0:05:01| We've exhausted, after we've exhausted, every option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-2?start=301)|
| 0:05:05| Euthanizing for space, however, will never be one of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-2?start=305)|
| 0:05:10| In response to taking in beagles from the massive rescue operation in Virginia,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-2?start=310)|
| 0:05:13| despite such a busy time of year for every shelter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-2?start=313)|
| 0:05:17| we strongly feel, as an animal center with more resources and manpower than other rural shelters| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-2?start=317)|
| 0:05:23| and a pet-loving community network who has proven time and time again to step up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-2?start=323)|
| 0:05:28| that it is our responsibility to lean in for the greater good| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-2?start=328)|
| 0:05:32| and work with our colleagues and national welfare organizations to be solution-driven| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-2?start=332)|
| 0:05:37| in moving animals out of disastrous situations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-2?start=337)|
| 0:05:41| This is no different than assisting devastated agencies in Louisiana, Texas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-2?start=341)|
| 0:05:47| and South Carolina during Hurricanes Irma and Harvey when we took in 59 animals to our foster program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-2?start=347)|
| 0:05:54| or became the hub for refrigerated vaccines to be transported to shelters in need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-2?start=354)|
| 0:06:01| I have no doubt that you as public servants would not hesitate to do the same| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-2?start=361)|
| 0:06:06| and step up to help your neighbors, or a community in crisis that has been decimated by a natural disaster,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-2?start=366)|
| 0:06:13| or in the case of these 4,000 beagles who were subjects of extreme cruelty and neglect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-2?start=373)|
| 0:06:19| As a side note, funding is often received from national animal welfare foundations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-2?start=379)|
| 0:06:24| to offset the cost of animals we help in these situations, as was the case with these beagles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-2?start=384)|
| 0:06:31| Finally, over the last two years, only 2% of animals came to us from out of county or state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-2?start=391)|
| 0:06:39| Many of those, however, were pets adopted from people in other counties and returned to us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-2?start=399)|
| 0:06:44| or animals who arrive at UT Vet Hospital from another county without a known owner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-2?start=404)|
| 0:06:50| and are ultimately transferred into our care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-2?start=410)|
| 0:06:54| I have provided a comprehensive overview of the full scope of services Young-Williams provides| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-2?start=414)|
| 0:06:59| to the pets and pet owners of our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-2?start=419)|
| 0:07:02| We are doing really great work, as I am confident you will find,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-2?start=422)|
| 0:07:07| and I want you to have the confidence moving forward that we are not only fulfilling a vital need in our community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-2?start=427)|
| 0:07:14| but that we are doing so with excellence, loyalty,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-2?start=434)|
| 0:07:18| and the desire to continue being an exemplary organization across this region, this state, and this country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-2?start=438)|
| 0:07:26| As evidenced with nearly $6 million of grant funding over the last handful of years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-2?start=446)|
| 0:07:31| national animal welfare organizations and foundations have chosen to invest in our growth and our future| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-2?start=451)|
| 0:07:38| because in a relatively short period of time, we have established a life-saving track record,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-2?start=458)|
| 0:07:44| improving our alignment, and not just industry gold standards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-2?start=464)|
| 0:07:47| but to our own mission of finding a home for every pet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-2?start=467)|
| 0:07:53| While we've been fortunate to celebrate a lot of successes, there is no question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-2?start=473)|
| 0:07:58| we carry a great deal of responsibility coupled with a lot of moving parts and growing pains| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-2?start=478)|
| 0:08:04| as we continue to build and refine our programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-2?start=484)|
| 0:08:08| We are in a constant state of improvement, paying attention to industry trends,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-2?start=488)|
| 0:08:12| and pivoting within the operation to become more effective and efficient.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-2?start=492)|
| 0:08:17| And as with any business operation and life in general, there are missteps and lessons learned every day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-2?start=497)|
| 0:08:24| but our strategy when we've hit a challenge is to fail forward, reevaluate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-2?start=504)|
| 0:08:29| and redirect as needed while staying on a positive trajectory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-2?start=509)|
| 0:08:34| I invite all of you to take the time to come take a tour of our main facility or all of our facilities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-2?start=514)|
| 0:08:40| learn more about who we are, the work that our magnificent, selfless, and dedicated team does| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-2?start=520)|
| 0:08:47| seven days a week, 365 days a year to create hope for pet owners at risk of losing their beloved companions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-2?start=527)|
| 0:08:55| and second chances for the thousands of homeless, stray, abandoned, injured, and neglected pets within our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-2?start=535)|
| 0:09:04| Thank you, and I'm happy to answer any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-2?start=544)|
| 0:09:09| Thank you, Councilmember Testerman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-2?start=549)|
| 0:09:13| Commissioner Lee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-2?start=553)|
| 0:09:17| I appreciate and applaud you for your work for animal welfare.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-2?start=557)|
| 0:09:24| I would ask to defer this 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-2?start=564)|
| 0:09:28| The question I asked last week was about the salaries of admin and your employees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-2?start=568)|
| 0:09:35| and I would like you to provide that to us, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-2?start=575)|
| 0:09:39| I did provide a personnel budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-2?start=579)|
| 0:09:41| I did not get the budget is not itemized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-2?start=581)|
| 0:09:48| By?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-2?start=588)|
| 0:09:49| I don't see that in the documents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-2?start=589)|

| 0:10:00| I mean, define admin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-2?start=600)|

| 0:10:15| I mean, I have a dozen plus departments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-2?start=615)|
| 0:10:19| Those are the questions that I'm asking because it's a million dollars,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-2?start=619)|
| 0:10:23| and I would just like to see the salaries of admin, management itemized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-2?start=623)|
| 0:10:31| The personnel budget alone is $3.2 million,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-2?start=631)|
| 0:10:36| which doesn't include, I mean, you've got benefits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-2?start=636)|

| 0:10:50| I'm still asking Madam Chair to defer this 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-2?start=650)|
| 0:10:54| Is that a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-2?start=654)|
| 0:10:55| Yes, it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-2?start=655)|
| 0:10:57| Commissioner Lee has a motion on the floor to defer this for 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-2?start=657)|
| 0:11:00| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-2?start=660)|
| 0:11:07| Actually, that would need to be a substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-2?start=667)|
| 0:11:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-2?start=669)|
| 0:11:10| Substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-2?start=670)|
| 0:11:11| Substitute motion to defer this item for 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-2?start=671)|
| 0:11:15| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-2?start=675)|
| 0:11:22| That item fails due to lack...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-2?start=682)|
| 0:11:24| That motion fails due to lack of second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-2?start=684)|
| 0:11:26| We're back to the original motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-2?start=686)|
| 0:11:33| We are still in discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-2?start=693)|
| 0:11:34| Commissioner Lee, would you like to continue?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-2?start=694)|
| 0:11:36| Your light is still on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-2?start=696)|
| 0:11:37| Oh, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-2?start=697)|
| 0:11:39| Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-2?start=699)|
| 0:11:41| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-2?start=701)|
| 0:11:44| Thanks for hanging in with us all through zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-2?start=704)|
| 0:11:46| That was great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-2?start=706)|
| 0:11:48| Sorry we didn't get to you earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-2?start=708)|
| 0:11:50| And I appreciate you sending the information to us this afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-2?start=710)|
| 0:11:56| I guess my concerns are, and this is not your fault,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-2?start=716)|
| 0:12:01| but this contract started on July 1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-2?start=721)|
| 0:12:05| We should have had this contract back in early spring for approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-2?start=725)|
| 0:12:11| And while I don't think it's a perfect contract,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-2?start=731)|
| 0:12:16| we're already, you know, one quarter of the way in it, basically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-2?start=736)|
| 0:12:22| And what I think our best course of action at this point is to probably have members of your team,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-2?start=742)|
| 0:12:31| members of City of Knoxville Animal Control, Knox County's Animal Control,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-2?start=751)|
| 0:12:36| sit down prior to us doing the renewal contract next summer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-2?start=756)|
| 0:12:42| Because I think there's just still some confusion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-2?start=762)|
| 0:12:47| I did get a copy of the MOU that you have with Zoo Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-2?start=767)|
| 0:12:55| But again, I think we're down the road here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-2?start=775)|
| 0:13:00| You guys have to know, you know, what funding you're going to get.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-2?start=780)|
| 0:13:05| And I just think we need to start a little bit earlier before we are approving contracts like this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-2?start=785)|
| 0:13:13| particularly when it's in excess of a million dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-2?start=793)|
| 0:13:18| I'd like to have Mr. Caldwell respond to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-2?start=798)|
| 0:13:21| I mean, we did have meetings earlier in the spring, so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-2?start=801)|
| 0:13:27| Mr. Caldwell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-2?start=807)|
| 0:13:30| Thank you. Yeah, I think we did have some meetings with the City of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-2?start=810)|
| 0:13:34| David Brace and myself, I think we were under the impression that the contract went another year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-2?start=814)|
| 0:13:41| And our good friend, Charlie Starkey in the law department, let us know that contract had expired.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-2?start=821)|
| 0:13:46| And so he worked with city law, and that's why this is delayed in getting here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-2?start=826)|
| 0:13:51| And so what I would say is I'm happy to bring any metrics that you all may want to see back to David| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-2?start=831)|
| 0:14:02| as we sit down with Janet to go over our relationship in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-2?start=842)|
| 0:14:06| And we're happy to look at those things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-2?start=846)|
| 0:14:09| I know that Janet is, she doesn't have issues with metrics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-2?start=849)|
| 0:14:14| And so anything that you'd like to see in a future contract is good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-2?start=854)|
| 0:14:19| Well, and I don't think, you know, I don't think members of this body have any issues with young Williams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-2?start=859)|
| 0:14:26| We realize what they have to deal with on a daily basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-2?start=866)|
| 0:14:30| But at the same time, we still have to look out for the interests of Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-2?start=870)|
| 0:14:35| particularly where we can take our animals that animal control is picking up on a daily basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-2?start=875)|
| 0:14:42| So I think just, again, it needs to go back to with sitting down with the city and the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-2?start=882)|
| 0:14:49| and with your staff to figure out going forward after this contract ends on June 30th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-2?start=889)|
| 0:15:01| Thank you, Commissioner Skinmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-2?start=901)|
| 0:15:02| Commissioner Jay, you're recognized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-2?start=902)|
| 0:15:03| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-2?start=903)|
| 0:15:06| Ms. Tesserman, I do want to say thank you for supplying information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-2?start=906)|
| 0:15:10| We had a long conversation last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-2?start=910)|
| 0:15:12| You were forthright in all of the information that I asked for and then some.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-2?start=912)|
| 0:15:16| I just want to acknowledge this is a tough business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-2?start=916)|
| 0:15:19| I get it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-2?start=919)|
| 0:15:20| We all get it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-2?start=920)|
| 0:15:22| This all stemmed from essentially the city and the county doing it themselves,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-2?start=922)|
| 0:15:26| trying to find a third-party system to kind of joining forces| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-2?start=926)|
| 0:15:31| in a metro way using a county building and trying to kind of partner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-2?start=931)|
| 0:15:35| And now it's certainly grown beyond the original focus of just city and county intake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-2?start=935)|
| 0:15:42| And it's, you know, grown into a much bigger animal welfare center with great value.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-2?start=942)|
| 0:15:48| It's no doubt that Knox County and the city of Knoxville needs your services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-2?start=948)|
| 0:15:52| I would echo that with Commissioner Skinmaker that I think we could do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-2?start=952)|
| 0:15:58| I think we could get more specific on the contract and some of the reporting at least| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-2?start=958)|
| 0:16:01| that I am interested in and do that for next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-2?start=961)|
| 0:16:05| I'm going to, you know, certainly vote to approve at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-2?start=965)|
| 0:16:08| We need the help from your organization and we want to see you thrive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-2?start=968)|
| 0:16:12| I just want to see us sort of think through all the parts and pieces| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-2?start=972)|
| 0:16:16| in a little bit more defined way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-2?start=976)|
| 0:16:19| And I would just encourage anybody that's doing more research like I am to maybe sit down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-2?start=979)|
| 0:16:25| and say, are these some metrics that can be obtained?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-2?start=985)|
| 0:16:29| Let's talk to our sheriff's office, let's talk to Mr. Esterman and then kind of work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-2?start=989)|
| 0:16:35| with finance to do that between now and, you know, maybe February so that when we go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-2?start=995)|
| 0:16:39| around to spring contracts, it's something we're much more comfortable with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-2?start=999)|
| 0:16:43| It has much more, you know, reporting or the analytics| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-2?start=1003)|
| 0:16:46| that will help us better understand the whole process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-2?start=1006)|
| 0:16:49| So thank you for supplying the information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-2?start=1009)|
| 0:16:52| Is there any more discussion for this item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-2?start=1012)|
| 0:17:00| Seeing none, the motion is to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-2?start=1020)|
| 0:17:04| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-2?start=1024)|
| 0:17:06| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-2?start=1026)|
| 0:17:07| Those opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-2?start=1027)|
| 0:17:08| Nay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-2?start=1028)|
| 0:17:13| That item passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-2?start=1033)|
| 0:17:17| Madam Clerk, next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-2?start=1037)|
| 0:17:23| On page 11, item number 53, consideration of a resolution of the Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-2?start=1043)|
| 0:17:30| of Knox County, Tennessee approving a community television agreement with Community Television| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-2?start=1050)|
| 0:17:35| of Knoxville, Inc. doing business as Knoxville Community Media, CTV,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-2?start=1055)|
| 0:17:40| to operate the access cable channels for public, educational,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-2?start=1060)|
| 0:17:44| and governmental access programming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-2?start=1064)|
| 0:17:46| Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-2?start=1066)|
| 0:17:49| I was going to go for discussion if somebody made the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-2?start=1069)|
| 0:17:53| Is there a motion to approve?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-2?start=1073)|
| 0:17:58| I'll second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-2?start=1078)|
| 0:17:59| Motion by Commissioner Hill to approve with a second by Commissioner Durrett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-2?start=1079)|
| 0:18:04| Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-2?start=1084)|
| 0:18:06| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-2?start=1086)|
| 0:18:09| I still think, of course, I've always been a big fan of community television.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-2?start=1089)|
| 0:18:14| I think they do a great job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-2?start=1094)|
| 0:18:15| I think the question I still have is when you're giving an entity a third of a million dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-2?start=1095)|
| 0:18:22| and you have no requirement for any deliverables,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-2?start=1102)|
| 0:18:26| I think that's kind of the wrong way to do a contract in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-2?start=1106)|
| 0:18:30| So, while I support community television, I'm going to vote no on this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-2?start=1110)|
| 0:18:35| just because I think we owe it to ourselves to have a list of actually what they're going to cover| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-2?start=1115)|
| 0:18:42| for $335,000 of taxpayer money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-2?start=1122)|
| 0:18:48| And if it's eight meetings, whatever the number is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-2?start=1128)|

| 0:26:20| with the general manager of Halstead Powell,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-2?start=1580)|
| 0:26:22| I asked him, how do you sustain that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-2?start=1582)|
| 0:26:24| What is your plan to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-2?start=1584)|
| 0:26:26| pay off this debt?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-2?start=1586)|

| 0:26:32| was to raise water and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-2?start=1592)|
| 0:26:34| sewer rates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-2?start=1594)|
| 0:26:36| And I propose that is not a good solution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-2?start=1596)|
| 0:26:38| for the ratepayers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-2?start=1598)|
| 0:26:40| However, this board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-2?start=1600)|
| 0:26:42| this Knox County Commission, has no control| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-2?start=1602)|

| 0:26:46| appointed this same person to be on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-2?start=1606)|

| 0:26:52| that we know, a minimum of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-2?start=1612)|

| 0:27:12| I don't think our Charter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-2?start=1632)|
| 0:27:14| was even considered in this matter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-2?start=1634)|

| 0:28:10| Is that an ordinance or a resolution?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-2?start=1690)|
| 0:28:12| It was an ordinance originally,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-2?start=1692)|
| 0:28:14| but then it was by vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-2?start=1694)|
| 0:28:16| Okay. Can somebody send that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-2?start=1696)|

| 0:28:54| members, or excuse me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-2?start=1734)|
| 0:28:56| do the boards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-2?start=1736)|
| 0:28:58| authorities and commissions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-2?start=1738)|
| 0:29:00| would Hollisdale Powell fall under| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-2?start=1740)|
| 0:29:02| 2.6 as a jurisdiction?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-2?start=1742)|
| 0:29:04| In our opinion, no. Utility districts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-2?start=1744)|
| 0:29:06| are not county boards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-2?start=1746)|
| 0:29:08| They're not controlled by the County Charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-2?start=1748)|
| 0:29:10| They have their origin in state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-2?start=1750)|
| 0:29:12| law. In fact,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-2?start=1752)|
| 0:29:14| if the county mayor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-2?start=1754)|
| 0:29:16| were to take no action| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-2?start=1756)|
| 0:29:18| to appoint somebody under the law, they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-2?start=1758)|
| 0:29:20| appoint their own member.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-2?start=1760)|
| 0:29:22| The county simply| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-2?start=1762)|
| 0:29:24| has no authority under state law to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-2?start=1764)|
| 0:29:26| impose term limits on utility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-2?start=1766)|
| 0:29:28| boards. In our opinion, this section| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-2?start=1768)|
| 0:29:30| refers to purely Knox County boards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-2?start=1770)|
| 0:29:32| like the Board of Zoning Appeals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-2?start=1772)|
| 0:29:34| the Merit Council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-2?start=1774)|
| 0:29:36| the Audit Committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-2?start=1776)|
| 0:29:38| things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-2?start=1778)|
| 0:29:40| I understand the concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-2?start=1780)|
| 0:29:42| My wife is from Powell| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-2?start=1782)|
| 0:29:44| and shares a lot of the same concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-2?start=1784)|
| 0:29:46| But we simply don't have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-2?start=1786)|
| 0:29:48| the authority to impose term limits on these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-2?start=1788)|
| 0:29:50| utility districts because they are not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-2?start=1790)|
| 0:29:52| Knox County committees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-2?start=1792)|
| 0:29:54| They're essentially their own sort of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-2?start=1794)|
| 0:29:56| independent corporations. It reminds me rather of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-2?start=1796)|
| 0:29:58| stories| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-2?start=1798)|
| 0:30:00| because I tell stories now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-2?start=1800)|
| 0:30:02| There used to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-2?start=1802)|
| 0:30:04| what was called the Tennessee Plan in Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-2?start=1804)|
| 0:30:06| that talked to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-2?start=1806)|
| 0:30:08| court of appeals judges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-2?start=1808)|
| 0:30:10| And the way that worked was very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-2?start=1810)|
| 0:30:12| similar to the way this works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-2?start=1812)|
| 0:30:14| There was a nominating committee that sent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-2?start=1814)|
| 0:30:16| three names to the governor. The governor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-2?start=1816)|
| 0:30:18| would pick one of the names or he could pick| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-2?start=1818)|
| 0:30:20| no names. And so that's how| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-2?start=1820)|
| 0:30:22| appellate judges got appointed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-2?start=1822)|
| 0:30:24| But that did not make them members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-2?start=1824)|
| 0:30:27| of the executive branch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-2?start=1827)|
| 0:30:29| They were still a separate thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-2?start=1829)|
| 0:30:31| And even though the mayor in this case has the right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-2?start=1831)|
| 0:30:33| to appoint, he's appointing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-2?start=1833)|
| 0:30:35| from a list of names given to him by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-2?start=1835)|
| 0:30:37| the utility district. And if he takes no action| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-2?start=1837)|
| 0:30:39| and refuses to appoint anybody,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-2?start=1839)|
| 0:30:41| then their number one nominee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-2?start=1841)|
| 0:30:43| becomes the nominee anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-2?start=1843)|
| 0:30:45| So there's no way that we could impose term limits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-2?start=1845)|
| 0:30:47| on them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-2?start=1847)|
| 0:30:49| And we just have no authority to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-2?start=1849)|
| 0:30:51| They're not a Knox County governed body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-2?start=1851)|
| 0:30:53| And so they're outside of the scope of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-2?start=1853)|
| 0:30:55| charter and outside of our ability to regulate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-2?start=1855)|
| 0:30:57| in the sense that 2-6| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-2?start=1857)|
| 0:30:59| I think meant when it was passed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-2?start=1859)|
| 0:31:01| in 2008.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-2?start=1861)|
| 0:31:03| So it's perfectly appropriate for a commissioner to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-2?start=1863)|
| 0:31:05| disapprove of the appointment, but it's not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-2?start=1865)|
| 0:31:07| illegal and it's not against our charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-2?start=1867)|
| 0:31:09| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-2?start=1869)|
| 0:31:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-2?start=1871)|
| 0:31:15| Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-2?start=1875)|
| 0:31:17| Thank you, Madam Chair. Commissioner Lee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-2?start=1877)|
| 0:31:19| so does the county mayor make all three| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-2?start=1879)|
| 0:31:21| appointments to that board?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-2?start=1881)|
| 0:31:23| Yes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-2?start=1883)|
| 0:31:25| but it's not done every year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-2?start=1885)|
| 0:31:27| It alternates, like there will be an appointment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-2?start=1887)|
| 0:31:29| next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-2?start=1889)|
| 0:31:31| And just to clarify a little bit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-2?start=1891)|
| 0:31:33| there were ten| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-2?start=1893)|
| 0:31:35| people that applied for that position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-2?start=1895)|
| 0:31:37| Hallsdale Powell submitted three| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-2?start=1897)|
| 0:31:39| names. The mayor had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-2?start=1899)|
| 0:31:41| the option to reject| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-2?start=1901)|
| 0:31:43| the list, send it back to Hallsdale Powell,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-2?start=1903)|
| 0:31:45| which at that point they would have had to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-2?start=1905)|
| 0:31:47| send another three names.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-2?start=1907)|
| 0:31:49| He could have rejected or he could have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-2?start=1909)|
| 0:31:51| selected anybody from that list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-2?start=1911)|
| 0:31:53| However, he picked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-2?start=1913)|
| 0:31:55| the same board member.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-2?start=1915)|
| 0:31:57| And I agree| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-2?start=1917)|
| 0:31:59| that we don't have as a body| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-2?start=1919)|
| 0:32:01| the commission to do anything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-2?start=1921)|
| 0:32:03| about that. I'm just expressing my| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-2?start=1923)|
| 0:32:05| disappointment and disapproval| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-2?start=1925)|
| 0:32:07| of that position in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-2?start=1927)|
| 0:32:09| spirit of our charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-2?start=1929)|
| 0:32:15| Thank you. Commissioner Lee, do you have anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-2?start=1935)|
| 0:32:17| No, that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-2?start=1937)|
| 0:32:19| Is there any more business to come before| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-2?start=1939)|
| 0:32:21| this meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-2?start=1941)|
| 0:32:23| of the Knox County Commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-2?start=1943)|
| 0:32:25| Seeing none, is there a motion to adjourn?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-2?start=1945)|
| 0:32:27| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-2?start=1947)|
| 0:32:29| We are adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220926-business-part-2?start=1949)|
