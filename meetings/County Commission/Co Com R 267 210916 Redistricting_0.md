| 0:02:35| and county of residence and then you have up to five minutes. Good evening my| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210916-redistricting?start=155)|
| 0:02:41| name is Timothy Klein I'm a Knox County resident. I'd like to just I'm just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210916-redistricting?start=161)|
| 0:02:47| interested in the process here I just like to kind of stand up and just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210916-redistricting?start=167)|
| 0:02:49| present a few items that I just have questions about to see where they're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210916-redistricting?start=169)|
| 0:02:54| where they are in the process whether they whether they're being considered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210916-redistricting?start=174)|
| 0:02:57| The first one is this question of the majority minority districts and I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210916-redistricting?start=177)|
| 0:03:02| understand there's some legal confusion about what constitutes a racial minority| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210916-redistricting?start=182)|
| 0:03:07| district whether it's a single race or a collection of all minorities so is that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210916-redistricting?start=187)|
| 0:03:12| is that been decided? Particularly is district one currently a majority| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210916-redistricting?start=192)|
| 0:03:21| minority district? I'm not sure what the question is. There is a there's a legal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210916-redistricting?start=201)|
| 0:03:29| question requiring majority minority districts districts that have a majority| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210916-redistricting?start=209)|
| 0:03:33| of either a single race or a total minority representation that's the point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210916-redistricting?start=213)|
| 0:03:39| of my question. Right now as I understand it district one for the census as a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210916-redistricting?start=219)|
| 0:03:44| major as a the white population is a minority by four people and that makes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210916-redistricting?start=224)|
| 0:03:52| it as I understand a majority minority district. I don't know the way the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210916-redistricting?start=232)|
| 0:04:00| language in the in the cases that I found the summaries suggest the language| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210916-redistricting?start=240)|
| 0:04:07| may be specifically to a single race or it may be to the collection of all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210916-redistricting?start=247)|
| 0:04:11| minorities in the district. Basically you got to go back to the one man one vote| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210916-redistricting?start=251)|
| 0:04:19| and it can't be gerrymandered so as to either politically or on the basis of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210916-redistricting?start=259)|
| 0:04:24| race, creed, color, nationality you cannot dilute or gerrymander to break up that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210916-redistricting?start=264)|
| 0:04:34| There's no question the first district has several of those and have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210916-redistricting?start=274)|
| 0:04:40| traditionally and nobody has ever fooled with the first district and I wouldn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210916-redistricting?start=280)|
| 0:04:44| anticipate that this committee is going to fool around with gerrymandering the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210916-redistricting?start=284)|
| 0:04:49| first district so that's my answer. I don't think they will and they you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210916-redistricting?start=289)|
| 0:04:57| Okay as I understand then this committee will respect that as a majority| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210916-redistricting?start=297)|
| 0:05:05| minority district and not reduce minority representation in the district?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210916-redistricting?start=305)|
| 0:05:09| I don't know what you mean by majority minority district. You look at you look| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210916-redistricting?start=309)|
| 0:05:15| at the factors that the have been presented by the census and that will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210916-redistricting?start=315)|
| 0:05:21| guide the one man one vote requirements as well as the other requirements that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210916-redistricting?start=321)|
| 0:05:26| you cannot dilute the voting power of a district which is has a high minority or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210916-redistricting?start=326)|
| 0:05:36| a high majority of a voting thing. You can't even gerrymander out Democrats and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210916-redistricting?start=336)|
| 0:05:42| Republicans and traditionally the first district has been Democratic voting and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210916-redistricting?start=342)|
| 0:05:47| they're clearly got a high minority in that district and I think everybody on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210916-redistricting?start=347)|
| 0:05:55| this committee respects that and will continue to respect that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210916-redistricting?start=355)|
| 0:06:00| Aubrey from planning would you like to speak on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210916-redistricting?start=360)|
| 0:06:04| Yes our office contacted the comptroller of the Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210916-redistricting?start=364)|
| 0:06:08| comptroller of the Treasury to ask that exact question. It hasn't been decided by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210916-redistricting?start=368)|
| 0:06:12| the Supreme Court but we were concerned about that. Legally we're not required| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210916-redistricting?start=372)|
| 0:06:16| to make what's called a minority coalition district but if the committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210916-redistricting?start=376)|
| 0:06:21| chooses to respect the minority coalition district we're within our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210916-redistricting?start=381)|
| 0:06:24| rights to. Okay yeah that that actually ties into I've been looking at the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210916-redistricting?start=384)|
| 0:06:29| numbers and just kind of essentially playing with them seeing where that goes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210916-redistricting?start=389)|
| 0:06:34| on my own and that whether or not you can dilute district one is kind of a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210916-redistricting?start=394)|
| 0:06:41| question of what are the options. Okay well thank you. Another a couple other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210916-redistricting?start=401)|
| 0:06:47| questions that I have are just kind of comments about the I think one of them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210916-redistricting?start=407)|
| 0:06:52| goes to you Mr. Davis about splitting precincts and kind of looking at the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210916-redistricting?start=412)|
| 0:06:56| numbers now there's a lot of very large precincts out especially out west 12,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210916-redistricting?start=416)|
| 0:07:00| 10,000 people. Is there any idea that you might split those precincts before| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210916-redistricting?start=420)|
| 0:07:07| assigning things to districts? Well no I will tell you we're not going to cut| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210916-redistricting?start=427)|
| 0:07:12| anything before November 17th at the absolute earliest because that's our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210916-redistricting?start=432)|
| 0:07:16| next Election Commission meeting and we do have a city of Knoxville primary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210916-redistricting?start=436)|
| 0:07:20| election coming up. I will tell you that and you may have I'm not sure what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210916-redistricting?start=440)|
| 0:07:24| numbers you looked at but while you've looked at population quite possibly I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210916-redistricting?start=444)|
| 0:07:29| totally guessing but but if you look at population I personally am more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210916-redistricting?start=449)|
| 0:07:33| concerned with number of registered voters and so that's more what I look at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210916-redistricting?start=453)|
| 0:07:37| and I will tell you you are correct we have a number of very large precincts in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210916-redistricting?start=457)|
| 0:07:42| number of registered voters and I would anticipate that sometime most likely in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210916-redistricting?start=462)|
| 0:07:47| early 2022 we will be breaking up a number of those to some degree. Exactly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210916-redistricting?start=467)|
| 0:07:53| what we're going to do right now I think I'm going to rely on the expertise both| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210916-redistricting?start=473)|
| 0:07:56| of KGIS and MPC to help me to help guide me in those decisions. I'm not prepared| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210916-redistricting?start=476)|
| 0:08:02| today to tell you that just because we're going to split up precincts we'll| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210916-redistricting?start=482)|
| 0:08:05| be moving polling places that may or may not happen totally depends on what this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210916-redistricting?start=485)|
| 0:08:10| body does and where we move things and that type of thing and available| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210916-redistricting?start=490)|
| 0:08:13| facilities and a lot of other things we have to look at but yeah I am I'm quite| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210916-redistricting?start=493)|
| 0:08:16| aware that there are a lot of large precincts there won't be anything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210916-redistricting?start=496)|
| 0:08:19| happening in the short term that will affect that. It was indeed the case I was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210916-redistricting?start=499)|
| 0:08:22| looking at population numbers yeah. And I will tell you generally speaking those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210916-redistricting?start=502)|
| 0:08:26| mirror in terms of the if it's large it's large but that's not always the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210916-redistricting?start=506)|
| 0:08:30| case and so you know it sounds bad to say but my concern is voters so anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210916-redistricting?start=510)|
| 0:08:35| Okay all right well thank you I'm eager to watch the process and I'm just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210916-redistricting?start=515)|
| 0:08:40| going to follow along and I'm trying to get some more understanding on it thank| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210916-redistricting?start=520)|
| 0:08:43| you. Thank you sir. Next is Virginia Babb.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210916-redistricting?start=523)|

| 0:09:01| around. Hopefully I've already seen this but it's basically a breakdown of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210916-redistricting?start=541)|
| 0:09:14| schools by district because I know as y'all are doing this I just want to keep| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210916-redistricting?start=554)|
| 0:09:19| have y'all keep in mind that as y'all are doing the redistricting there are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210916-redistricting?start=559)|
| 0:09:23| 11 County Commissioners and one school board member on this so I can tell where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210916-redistricting?start=563)|
| 0:09:28| the focus of the conversation is going to be and it's going to be much more on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210916-redistricting?start=568)|
| 0:09:32| how the lines are drawn for County Commission but while y'all are doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210916-redistricting?start=572)|
| 0:09:36| that I really want you to consider what your what the effects of changing the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210916-redistricting?start=576)|
| 0:09:41| lines are to school districts because I do think the concern for school board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210916-redistricting?start=581)|
| 0:09:46| members at least for me and I can only speak for me I can't speak for other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210916-redistricting?start=586)|
| 0:09:49| school board members is concerning zoning and some districts in our County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210916-redistricting?start=589)|
| 0:09:56| are very easy I mean over in South Knoxville I mean it's pretty you know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210916-redistricting?start=596)|
| 0:10:01| clear elementary schools pretty much all feed into South Doyle Middle and then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210916-redistricting?start=601)|
| 0:10:05| they all feed into South Doyle High School. When you get into West Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210916-redistricting?start=605)|
| 0:10:10| it gets a lot more complicated and it's already complicated and so one of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210916-redistricting?start=610)|
| 0:10:15| things I had been told and I was not part of the redistricting last time and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210916-redistricting?start=615)|
| 0:10:19| I don't know that anybody here was but I was told at that point that the really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210916-redistricting?start=619)|
| 0:10:24| concern was trying to keep one high school at least in every district and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210916-redistricting?start=624)|
| 0:10:28| when you look at this breakdown you'll see some of the districts already have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210916-redistricting?start=628)|
| 0:10:31| two high schools in them there are several that have three my district which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210916-redistricting?start=631)|
| 0:10:38| district four it's not really mine district for the one that Daniel Watson| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210916-redistricting?start=638)|
| 0:10:43| represents and I think one other one only have one high school right now so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210916-redistricting?start=643)|
| 0:10:48| as you're changing lines I really hope you consider that a priority that there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210916-redistricting?start=648)|
| 0:10:54| at least is a high school in there and also consider how the zoning is I mean| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210916-redistricting?start=654)|
| 0:10:59| I'm already hearing rumors a lot of rumors some that have even said it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210916-redistricting?start=659)|

| 0:12:25| just kind of trying to bring to y'all's attention those concerns that I have and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210916-redistricting?start=745)|
| 0:12:29| hope that you really will take into consideration school zoning as you're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210916-redistricting?start=749)|
| 0:12:34| making these decisions. Board Member Babs, do you know the last time the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210916-redistricting?start=754)|

| 0:12:54| would be a good question to maybe find out I mean I know when like North Shore| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210916-redistricting?start=774)|
| 0:12:58| Elementary happened that would have caused a lot of. Anytime a new school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210916-redistricting?start=778)|
| 0:13:03| comes into play there's a change but I'm wondering the last time the school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210916-redistricting?start=783)|
| 0:13:06| board sat down and looked at their zones independent of a new school coming on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210916-redistricting?start=786)|
| 0:13:11| board. Yeah and that might be a consideration and this is another thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210916-redistricting?start=791)|
| 0:13:15| I would also love for y'all to look at is some of the natural boundaries I mean| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210916-redistricting?start=795)|
| 0:13:19| one that I would I would sort of logically say is Pellissippi Parkway is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210916-redistricting?start=799)|
| 0:13:25| not a line for Farragut but I think a lot of people sort of consider it a line| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210916-redistricting?start=805)|
| 0:13:29| for where Farragut starts but the Farragut district bleeds on to the east| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210916-redistricting?start=809)|
| 0:13:35| side of Pellissippi Parkway and District 4 kind of goes up North Shore so I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210916-redistricting?start=815)|
| 0:13:40| there's some even natural lines where people even think about some natural| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210916-redistricting?start=820)|
| 0:13:43| borders that also could be thought about. So anyway thank you for your time. Thank| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210916-redistricting?start=823)|

| 0:14:06| want to bring to your attention. I want to echo what board member Babb said I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210916-redistricting?start=846)|
| 0:14:13| think that there's some room for moving some of these adjusting some of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210916-redistricting?start=853)|
| 0:14:18| boundaries on the district so they're more consistent with the way the schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210916-redistricting?start=858)|
| 0:14:23| the schools and the feeders are. I would encourage you to look at that the you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210916-redistricting?start=863)|
| 0:14:29| know that one of the things that we're supposed to look at with redistricting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210916-redistricting?start=869)|
| 0:14:32| is communities of interest and I think one of the basic communities of interest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210916-redistricting?start=872)|
| 0:14:36| that crosses all other issues is what what what feeds to schools elementary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210916-redistricting?start=876)|
| 0:14:43| schools middle schools high schools the high school gets districts I mean zones| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210916-redistricting?start=883)|
| 0:14:47| are pretty big elementary ones you know it seems like at least elementary school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210916-redistricting?start=887)|
| 0:14:51| zones we should be we should try to avoid splitting of it into two district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210916-redistricting?start=891)|
| 0:14:56| different districts it'd be nice if you could do that with the high schools but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210916-redistricting?start=896)|
| 0:15:00| I'm not sure that's really possible. So there's two of the things that I would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210916-redistricting?start=900)|
| 0:15:04| like I've been looking at these maps and trying to figure out what I thought was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210916-redistricting?start=904)|
| 0:15:08| a sensible way to change the districts we obviously have to make five and six| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210916-redistricting?start=908)|
| 0:15:14| smaller and eight needs to be bigger and then there that means everybody in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210916-redistricting?start=914)|
| 0:15:19| middle has to be tweaked a little bit and and this hill had her made a nice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210916-redistricting?start=919)|
| 0:15:29| stab at it last week I guess it was of trying to do it and she had a good| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210916-redistricting?start=929)|
| 0:15:35| suggestion for moving something from four to five but because of the way the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210916-redistricting?start=935)|
| 0:15:40| the the precincts are laid out it was less it was less it was bet it could| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210916-redistricting?start=940)|
| 0:15:50| have been better if the priest because of the way the precincts were precincts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210916-redistricting?start=950)|
| 0:15:54| were laid out like long skinny things this way and so you take a precinct this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210916-redistricting?start=954)|
| 0:15:58| way and you end up with another one to get the population balance and as I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210916-redistricting?start=958)|
| 0:16:04| walked out through about that it would be a lot more sensible if those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210916-redistricting?start=964)|
| 0:16:08| districts were split at Ebenezer Road and they had our east and a west side| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210916-redistricting?start=968)|
| 0:16:14| and the east side went to four and the west side stayed with five something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210916-redistricting?start=974)|
| 0:16:19| like that in order for the citizens and for you the commissioners to figure out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210916-redistricting?start=979)|
| 0:16:25| logical ways to do this my suggestion is that you ask the Knox planning to take a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210916-redistricting?start=985)|
| 0:16:32| look at the current precincts and lay out where logical splits to those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210916-redistricting?start=992)|
| 0:16:39| precincts would be so that because you know like in those I think it's 69 N and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210916-redistricting?start=999)|
| 0:16:45| W those are you know long skinny Tennessee shaped disk precincts and if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210916-redistricting?start=1005)|
| 0:16:52| they were split at both of met at Ebenezer they would be you'd be easier| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210916-redistricting?start=1012)|
| 0:16:57| to have the east ones go east and the west one stay west and I would I would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210916-redistricting?start=1017)|
| 0:17:03| ask that they they take the bigger precincts at least the ones that over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210916-redistricting?start=1023)|
| 0:17:07| 6,000 and split them into smaller pieces in ways with boundaries that would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210916-redistricting?start=1027)|
| 0:17:12| logical you know following natural things and major highways and stuff like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210916-redistricting?start=1032)|
| 0:17:16| that and that would help you guys and also as citizens figure out oh this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210916-redistricting?start=1036)|
| 0:17:22| would be a sensible place to make this change so I want and that and my third| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210916-redistricting?start=1042)|
| 0:17:27| suggestion is let's start off by getting rid of the things that shouldn't be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210916-redistricting?start=1047)|
| 0:17:34| there district 5 has a little piece of the of its district that goes into| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210916-redistricting?start=1054)|

| 0:18:00| just the geographic boundary of the town of Farragut is all is the reason that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210916-redistricting?start=1080)|
| 0:18:04| there right yeah well I don't think that anybody had a bad reason for having it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210916-redistricting?start=1084)|
| 0:18:09| there but from the county point of view the city of Knoxville has similar kind| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210916-redistricting?start=1089)|
| 0:18:14| of things if you go in towards the city Knoxville there are things they just get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210916-redistricting?start=1094)|

| 0:18:39| the city it makes a totally irrational zoning and I don't know how you solve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210916-redistricting?start=1119)|
| 0:18:49| that I mean that's a really a big problem for mr. Davis to try to figure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210916-redistricting?start=1129)|
| 0:18:52| out how to handle these things but we have these things that were precincts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210916-redistricting?start=1132)|

| 0:36:30| think I guess I the the cases with regard to this overall 10% between 10| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210916-redistricting?start=2190)|

| 0:36:44| 16 10 percent below is okay in between you may have reasons I I read what he| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210916-redistricting?start=2204)|
| 0:36:51| said as being per district so there's a there's a little difference here in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210916-redistricting?start=2211)|
| 0:36:58| interpretation but what I read the comptroller says it's it's it's the 10| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210916-redistricting?start=2218)|
| 0:37:05| percent in a particular district and I'm not sure if that answers your question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210916-redistricting?start=2225)|
| 0:37:10| it helps it helps but I guess my question more more had to do with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210916-redistricting?start=2230)|

| 0:55:35| do the first one was to balance the numbers and stay within our deviation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210916-redistricting?start=3335)|

| 0:55:57| I went into this if you all will look at this piece of paper right here that that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210916-redistricting?start=3357)|

| 0:57:52| by her response where and I will read it she said I've attached a table and map| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210916-redistricting?start=3472)|
| 0:58:00| the overall deviation is within the required range so that's one bullet that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210916-redistricting?start=3480)|
| 0:58:05| was hit however district one does not look does lose some of its minority| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210916-redistricting?start=3485)|

| 0:58:34| changed from without I mean the numbers are it's just hard to figure out the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210916-redistricting?start=3514)|
| 0:58:38| boundary lines of where they went from and to I do I have the I'm just trying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210916-redistricting?start=3518)|
| 0:58:51| to figure out on the map itself like where like it's hard to 24 Q for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210916-redistricting?start=3531)|
| 0:58:56| instance yeah I didn't know if there was like a dotted line that showed where it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210916-redistricting?start=3536)|
| 0:59:00| where it used to be or no but for future meetings I can make sure to add that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210916-redistricting?start=3540)|
| 0:59:05| thank you so I responded back to miss Weiland and asked her if there were any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210916-redistricting?start=3545)|
| 0:59:11| precincts bordering district one that would not contribute to the loss of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210916-redistricting?start=3551)|
| 0:59:16| minority voting power and you can see above what her response was which I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210916-redistricting?start=3556)|
| 0:59:23| think after I read this response was basically no there's not there's that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210916-redistricting?start=3563)|
| 0:59:32| would read that would in in fact not affect the minority balance or if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210916-redistricting?start=3572)|
| 0:59:40| anything it would increase it with a few of our test scenarios we were able to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210916-redistricting?start=3580)|
| 0:59:45| add and remove precincts from district one without taking away that majority| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210916-redistricting?start=3585)|
| 0:59:52| minority population so there are ways that you could strategize that okay well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210916-redistricting?start=3592)|
| 1:00:01| thank you maybe that's something we certainly yeah mm-hmm and and those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210916-redistricting?start=3601)|
| 1:00:07| precincts were removed from which district the one that I had mentioned as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210916-redistricting?start=3607)|
| 1:00:13| an example to Commissioner Hill was just precinct 10 n which was moved from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210916-redistricting?start=3613)|
| 1:00:19| district 1 to 2 district 9 a few of the district or precincts in district 2| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210916-redistricting?start=3619)|
| 1:00:26| could potentially be moved or in district 3 there are a lot of ways that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210916-redistricting?start=3626)|
| 1:00:34| when you all are calculating this that you can try moving them around and see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210916-redistricting?start=3634)|
| 1:00:38| what happens so if I read this correctly the district 10 that you had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210916-redistricting?start=3638)|
| 1:00:46| mentioned I think that was the one is actually a removal from district 1 is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210916-redistricting?start=3646)|
| 1:00:51| that correct that's correct it was just an example though which just decreases| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210916-redistricting?start=3651)|
| 1:00:56| their population even more which is is not yes it could be a bad example yeah| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210916-redistricting?start=3656)|
| 1:01:05| it is I understand what you're saying so anyway I just put that out there for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210916-redistricting?start=3665)|
| 1:01:11| your consideration it does it does hit the check marks as far as the the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210916-redistricting?start=3671)|
| 1:01:16| balancing the population and again I know that it's it's certainly not it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210916-redistricting?start=3676)|
| 1:01:26| certainly not ideal but I will tell some of the folks Virginia especially well in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210916-redistricting?start=3686)|
| 1:01:34| Lance too that when we look at redrawing these numbers because we are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210916-redistricting?start=3694)|
| 1:01:39| limited because we have to keep our spree precincts intact at the moment so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210916-redistricting?start=3699)|
| 1:01:46| many of the precincts in the West area are huge that if you take one of those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210916-redistricting?start=3706)|
| 1:01:51| precincts and move them then you are just you are creating a problem for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210916-redistricting?start=3711)|

| 1:02:40| much as seven different ways to middle schools and then filter that way even| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210916-redistricting?start=3760)|
| 1:02:46| into I think three high schools Northwest is is the area specifically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210916-redistricting?start=3766)|

| 1:03:17| to take that into account I would just like to make one statement to make sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210916-redistricting?start=3797)|

| 1:03:55| I guess we're down to four meetings going forward beyond today all right are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210916-redistricting?start=3835)|
| 1:04:01| you looking for this type of thing where commissioners bring a scenario I mean| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210916-redistricting?start=3841)|
| 1:04:07| this is a scenario presented by Commissioner Hill is it is it the intent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210916-redistricting?start=3847)|
| 1:04:12| that any one of us come up with a scenario ask planning to put it through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210916-redistricting?start=3852)|
| 1:04:18| the ringer and then bring it and say well here's my idea of how to change it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210916-redistricting?start=3858)|
| 1:04:21| and then we start whittling that down to voting on those or are we gonna help me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210916-redistricting?start=3861)|
| 1:04:27| understand kind of how to go forward from here way I believe if you look at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210916-redistricting?start=3867)|
| 1:04:32| the last time this happened that there was several alternative plans put| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210916-redistricting?start=3872)|
| 1:04:36| together I think this should be organic and come from individual commissioners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210916-redistricting?start=3876)|
| 1:04:40| going to the planning department and saying run this scenario I think if we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210916-redistricting?start=3880)|
| 1:04:45| get to three four or five maybe eight plans this committee will vote on a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210916-redistricting?start=3885)|

| 1:05:11| would be the best process I know that I along with the chair are going to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210916-redistricting?start=3911)|
| 1:05:18| having meetings with commissioners to get their inputs and their ideas but I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210916-redistricting?start=3918)|
| 1:05:22| think ultimately like Miss Hill is done if a few of us go to planning and work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210916-redistricting?start=3922)|
