| 0:02:52| Good evening, everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=172)|
| 0:02:55| I want to start by first saying I had the opportunity to go to a very special event on Saturday night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=175)|
| 0:03:02| I think it was the most incredible live sports event that I've ever had the pleasure to attend,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=182)|
| 0:03:09| in part because being such a big-time fan for so many years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=189)|
| 0:03:14| that satisfaction of seeing that win of the University of Tennessee football team was something that I,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=194)|
| 0:03:21| along with many people across the state and region, were very excited about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=201)|
| 0:03:25| So I want to congratulate the football team for having an incredible season| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=205)|
| 0:03:30| and just generating a lot of excitement and enthusiasm in our city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=210)|
| 0:03:35| And more importantly to this meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=215)|
| 0:03:38| I want to thank the members of our public service crews who had to do a lot of cleaning up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=218)|
| 0:03:44| and keeping things orderly before, during, and after the weekend,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=224)|
| 0:03:49| and also to our police and fire departments who had a lot of extra calls for service both during and after the game.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=229)|
| 0:03:57| And I want to just thank all of the city employees who worked extra hard and long hours,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=237)|
| 0:04:03| extra shifts to keep our city running smoothly and safely during a time that was fun for many of us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=243)|
| 0:04:10| but also a lot of raucous celebration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=250)|
| 0:04:14| So thank you to everybody for your hard work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=254)|
| 0:04:19| Speaking of the fire department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=259)|
| 0:04:21| I want to thank the quick actions of all our first responders| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=261)|
| 0:04:25| who helped rescue people who were trapped last week during an apartment fire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=265)|
| 0:04:29| Both police and firefighters helped get people to safety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=269)|
| 0:04:32| Two police officers had to be transported to the hospital for smoke inhalation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=272)|
| 0:04:37| I believe they're fine and fully recovered now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=277)|
| 0:04:39| Is that right, Chief?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=279)|
| 0:04:41| So their selflessness and courageous acts helped to save lives in our city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=281)|
| 0:04:45| So please give our first responders, our fire and police officers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=285)|
| 0:04:48| who responded to this and so many other calls, let's give them a round of applause.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=288)|
| 0:04:52| I also had the opportunity, along with Councilmember Testerman and McKenzie,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=292)|
| 0:05:04| this afternoon to celebrate the opening of a great milestone in the Western Heights community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=304)|
| 0:05:11| the ribbon-cutting for the new Head Start facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=311)|
| 0:05:14| Every resident in Knoxville should have access to education and the tools to thrive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=314)|
| 0:05:20| and this Head Start facility is a great step in the right direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=320)|
| 0:05:24| And I'm particularly supportive and know how important it is to have access to strong early childhood education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=324)|
| 0:05:31| That gets kids and their families off on the right foot, and the benefits last for a lifetime.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=331)|
| 0:05:37| So thanks to all the people, KCDC, the financing partners, the development partners, for making that possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=337)|
| 0:05:44| And I look forward to seeing all the lives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=344)|
| 0:05:46| There will be 100 kids in there probably by the end of November,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=346)|
| 0:05:50| and all the lives that will be changed over the years to come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=350)|
| 0:05:53| It's just the first step in the part of transforming Western initiative that we've all been looking forward to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=353)|
| 0:06:01| Another item later this week that I wanted to make sure Council and members of the public were aware of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=361)|
| 0:06:07| you can come to pay your respects at this year's Fallen Firefighter Memorial Service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=367)|
| 0:06:13| It's this Thursday at 11 a.m. at Maricosta Plaza.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=373)|
| 0:06:18| This service, this is a new location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=378)|
| 0:06:20| Just for those of you who usually go to this, this is a different location than normal due to, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=380)|
| 0:06:26| some issues happening at the other site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=386)|
| 0:06:29| This service honors the memories of firefighters who have passed away both on and off the job,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=389)|
| 0:06:34| and we will also be honoring our fire department retirees at a luncheon following the memorial service,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=394)|
| 0:06:39| and free parking is available at the Coliseum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=399)|
| 0:06:42| So a quick reminder on the rules of decorum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=402)|
| 0:06:46| Those who wish to speak either to a specific agenda item or during public forum should sign up with Mr. Johnson,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=406)|
| 0:06:51| the city recorder, ahead of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=411)|
| 0:06:54| Please do not use profanity when speaking to specific agenda items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=414)|
| 0:06:57| Please stay on topic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=417)|
| 0:06:59| Those who fail to adhere to these rules may be ruled out of order and asked to step away from the podium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=419)|
| 0:07:05| For those who are listening, please note that you may not disrupt a public meeting from the audience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=425)|
| 0:07:09| Those who do may be asked to leave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=429)|
| 0:07:11| Thank you in advance for your respect for these rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=431)|
| 0:07:14| And that concludes my mayor's report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=434)|
| 0:07:18| Next are the reports of council members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=438)|
| 0:07:21| Vice Mayor Roberto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=441)|
| 0:07:22| Thank you, Mayor, and thank you for mentioning the game on Saturday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=442)|
| 0:07:26| That was certainly a wonderful result and just a great game to watch,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=446)|
| 0:07:32| and looking forward to the rest of the season.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=452)|
| 0:07:35| I just wanted to remind those in attendance here and those who might be watching on TV that there's an election coming up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=455)|
| 0:07:43| Early voting in our federal and state general election starts tomorrow, Wednesday, October the 19th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=463)|
| 0:07:48| and will go through Thursday, November 3rd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=468)|
| 0:07:54| Election day is Tuesday, November 8th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=474)|
| 0:07:56| so I hope everyone will get out and let their voice be heard and vote in those federal and state elections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=476)|
| 0:08:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=481)|
| 0:08:03| Thank you, Vice Mayor Roberto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=483)|
| 0:08:04| Any other reports from council members?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=484)|
| 0:08:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=488)|
| 0:08:09| Seeing none, we'll move along to item 9A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=489)|
| 0:08:13| 9A is an ordinance to amend the operating capital budgets for fiscal year 2022-2023.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=493)|
| 0:08:18| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=498)|
| 0:08:19| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=499)|
| 0:08:20| Motion made to approve and seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=500)|
| 0:08:21| Vice Mayor Roberto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=501)|
| 0:08:22| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=502)|
| 0:08:24| It's clear from the first reading of this that more discussion is needed regarding the transfer of a vacant position| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=504)|
| 0:08:31| from plans review and inspection to create a new special assistant position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=511)|
| 0:08:36| I believe this is a significant proposal and deserves to be considered on its own.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=516)|
| 0:08:41| Before making a motion on this, I'd like to hear about any impacts from removing this specific item from the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=521)|
| 0:08:51| Vice Mayor Roberto, there are no significant impacts, and I support this amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=531)|
| 0:08:55| I agree we need to discuss it more before moving forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=535)|
| 0:08:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=538)|
| 0:08:59| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=539)|
| 0:09:00| I make a motion to amend the ordinance so as to delete the transfer of the position from plans review and inspection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=540)|
| 0:09:06| and the funds associated with that transfer equal to an amount of $25,500.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=546)|
| 0:09:12| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=552)|
| 0:09:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=553)|
| 0:09:14| Motion made to amend per what Vice Mayor Roberto said and has been made and seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=554)|
| 0:09:20| Is there questions and discussions about the amendment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=560)|
| 0:09:23| Council Member Parker, not about the amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=563)|
| 0:09:26| Any other questions or discussion about the amendment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=566)|
| 0:09:28| Seeing none, all those in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=568)|

| 0:09:34| Now we're back to considering the motion on the floor as amended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=574)|
| 0:09:39| Council Member Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=579)|
| 0:09:41| I'd like to make a motion to divide the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=581)|
| 0:09:45| I need a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=585)|
| 0:09:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=586)|
| 0:09:47| Motion has been made to divide the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=587)|
| 0:09:48| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=588)|
| 0:09:50| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=590)|
| 0:09:51| It's been seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=591)|
| 0:09:53| I think we need a little more details on divided in what manner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=593)|
| 0:09:58| Like divide is a pretty broad term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=598)|
| 0:10:01| Each budget line item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=601)|
| 0:10:02| Going through a budget line item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=602)|
| 0:10:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=604)|
| 0:10:07| Okay, the motion has been made to divide it out into each budget line item and has been made and seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=607)|
| 0:10:14| Any questions or discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=614)|
| 0:10:17| Seeing none, all those in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=617)|
| 0:10:19| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=619)|
| 0:10:20| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=620)|
| 0:10:21| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=621)|
| 0:10:22| Motion to amend fails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=622)|
| 0:10:23| Back to the motion as amended by Vice Member Berta's amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=623)|
| 0:10:30| Any further questions or discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=630)|
| 0:10:32| Council Member Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=632)|
| 0:10:33| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=633)|
| 0:10:36| I have concerns about multiple items included in here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=636)|
| 0:10:41| I'm glad that the zoning position was removed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=641)|
| 0:10:47| That was one I felt needed much more discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=647)|
| 0:10:52| Before being presented before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=652)|
| 0:10:57| But a couple that concerned me were Millitown Pike improvements project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=657)|
| 0:11:03| We have 1.2 million being removed from that project because of a delay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=663)|
| 0:11:13| Usually with capital projects of this nature to ensure they move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=673)|
| 0:11:18| We keep that money and continue to grow usually that pot of money until we're able to complete that project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=678)|
| 0:11:26| I'm very concerned with removing that 1.2 million that there will be an even further delay in that project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=686)|
| 0:11:35| And there's already been a delay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=695)|
| 0:11:37| There was money removed from this project, I believe, for the Cumberland project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=697)|
| 0:11:42| So this is another delay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=702)|
| 0:11:45| Mr. Brace, could you speak to the...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=705)|
| 0:11:48| Yeah, the removal of the 1.2 is very just pragmatic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=708)|
| 0:11:51| We plan on resubmitting the funds we need for that project in the next fiscal year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=711)|
| 0:11:57| And so those dollars, again, will be back before you in the next budget cycle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=717)|
| 0:12:03| And we, again, the delays were really around the construction adjacent to these improvements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=723)|
| 0:12:10| And so those delays impacted this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=730)|
| 0:12:14| We do anticipate completing it and putting it into the next fiscal year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=734)|
| 0:12:18| And is there a different source for that funding?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=738)|
| 0:12:22| So I think maybe you may have Washington Pike and Millartown confused.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=742)|
| 0:12:26| So Millartown, the Washington Pike project is funded through a combination of local funds and TDOT funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=746)|
| 0:12:34| That project is continuing to move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=754)|
| 0:12:36| This is a very specific project right there off of Millartown adjacent to the large capital private investment, the former mall site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=756)|
| 0:12:46| And again, we've already talked about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=766)|
| 0:12:49| There was no reason for those dollars not to be spent and to be sitting in that capital account.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=769)|
| 0:12:53| We will be requesting additional funds in the next fiscal year process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=773)|
| 0:12:59| So the source of funding is not changing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=779)|
| 0:13:01| It's city funding for the Millartown Pike?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=781)|
| 0:13:04| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=784)|
| 0:13:06| Could you tell me what the source of funding is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=786)|
| 0:13:08| These were local funds for the Millartown Pike project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=788)|
| 0:13:11| Tom, I'm looking at Tom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=791)|
| 0:13:12| These are local funds to do work adjacent to the Amazon site over off of Millartown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=792)|
| 0:13:18| The Washington Pike project is a combination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=798)|
| 0:13:20| No, no, no. We're just talking about Millartown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=800)|
| 0:13:21| Okay. So that is federal funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=801)|
| 0:13:23| The Washington Pike is federal funding with local match.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=803)|
| 0:13:25| This is local funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=805)|
| 0:13:27| Okay. So we're going to remove $1.2 million of local funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=807)|
| 0:13:32| And then it will come back before us in five months or less?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=812)|
| 0:13:37| We're going to reappropriate it to fund other items within this budget amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=817)|
| 0:13:41| And it would come back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=821)|
| 0:13:42| There will be a request to properly fund that with the timing of that project in the next fiscal year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=822)|
| 0:13:49| Okay. Other concerns are the Rock Point Road and intersection improvements project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=829)|
| 0:13:55| We have not seen any updates on this project since 2019.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=835)|
| 0:14:03| So thank you very much for the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=843)|
| 0:14:05| So Rock Point Road, the road, the access public road and the intersection,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=845)|
| 0:14:11| if you're familiar with where the Shoney's are, Rutledge Pike, Asheville Highway, I-40.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=851)|
| 0:14:15| So that has been a multiyear project where property has been acquired, blighted properties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=855)|
| 0:14:23| and actually a commercial building have been demolished.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=863)|
| 0:14:26| We have been waiting on the developer to come forward and be ready to initiate this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=866)|
| 0:14:32| That has taken some time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=872)|
| 0:14:34| You've probably seen some improvements, a significant number of improvements there on I-40 adjacent to this new project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=874)|
| 0:14:44| But it is ready. The developer came to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=884)|
| 0:14:47| It is ready to be completed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=887)|
| 0:14:50| So this funding is to get that project started and the developer is ready to move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=890)|
| 0:14:56| And the last I saw regarding this project was a public input process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=896)|
| 0:15:04| but I never saw any results from that public input process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=904)|
| 0:15:08| I'm not aware that there was any public input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=908)|
| 0:15:11| It's a public road and improving a really kind of just – I think –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=911)|
| 0:15:17| Mr. Bruce, if you could just speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=917)|
| 0:15:19| I'm sorry. This is a very specific project related to consolidation of multiple parcels on Asheville Highway in the 6th District,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=919)|
| 0:15:27| kind of Rutledge Pike I-40 adjacent to that Shoney's, which is kind of a landmark property out there for many years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=927)|
| 0:15:34| The overall intersections improvement of that, that's a TDOT project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=934)|
| 0:15:40| That is different than this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=940)|
| 0:15:41| This is a very specific access, public access road to new commercial industrial land right on I-40 that has been vacant for many years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=941)|
| 0:15:51| This has been ongoing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=951)|
| 0:15:52| I want to say I'm looking at Mr. Berry about a decade, eight years with the owner of the adjacent property who assembled all of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=952)|
| 0:16:00| The chamber looked at it, has a significant economic development impact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=960)|
| 0:16:04| We've been waiting for the developer to complete a number of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=964)|
| 0:16:08| Mr. Berry has been working with TDOT to clean up a number of remnant right-of-way pieces of land there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=968)|
| 0:16:15| But it is ready to move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=975)|
| 0:16:17| The larger project is a multi-year project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=977)|
| 0:16:19| Mr. Clabo may be able to talk about that, where that overall area, TDOT, is looking at where those state routes intersect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=979)|
| 0:16:26| And, Mr. Clabo, I'm not sure if you've got an update on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=986)|
| 0:16:29| Mr. Clabo?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=989)|
| 0:16:31| Tom Clabo, engineering director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=991)|
| 0:16:35| I'm not sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=995)|
| 0:16:36| Are you talking about the study that was conducted at Routledge Pike?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=996)|
| 0:16:39| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=999)|
| 0:16:40| So that study was completed, but there is no additional funding to move that project forward right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=1000)|
| 0:16:48| So that was kind of the flyover of Routledge Pike and Asheville Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=1008)|
| 0:16:56| And so, as of right now, there is a complete study with a concept design, but there's no funded project for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=1016)|
| 0:17:05| Could you send me the details for this Rock Point Road project?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=1025)|
| 0:17:11| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=1031)|
| 0:17:12| We've got design documents that are essentially complete.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=1032)|
| 0:17:16| So, Mr. Clabo, we could send those to members of council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=1036)|
| 0:17:20| And, absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=1040)|
| 0:17:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=1043)|
| 0:17:24| Ms. Parker, Ms. Ryder has her light on, and we can come back to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=1044)|
| 0:17:29| You've had five minutes, and we'll go to Ms. Ryder and come back to you after.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=1049)|
| 0:17:33| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=1053)|
| 0:17:34| I just needed some clarification from the conversation that just happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=1054)|
| 0:17:37| Mr. Clabo, the Routledge Pike-Asheville Highway flyover, that public meeting and input process, has nothing to do with the Rock Point Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=1057)|
| 0:17:46| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=1066)|
| 0:17:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=1067)|
| 0:17:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=1068)|
| 0:17:49| I was confused at how they tied together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=1069)|
| 0:17:50| Appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=1070)|
| 0:17:53| Any further questions or discussions on Item 9A?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=1073)|
| 0:17:55| Yes, I have more questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=1075)|
| 0:17:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=1076)|
| 0:17:57| Ms. Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=1077)|
| 0:18:01| I've already reached out to Director Lomax about my concerns about the use of the community empowerment funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=1081)|
| 0:18:12| And I'm concerned not only with this agenda item, but other agenda items that, well, I can couple it here with the $125,000 for the financial empowerment center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=1092)|
| 0:18:30| And, yeah, that's the other two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=1110)|
| 0:18:35| With other agenda items that have come across, we need to engage the community sooner rather than later, because the plans that I'm seeing come across do not reflect what I'm hearing from the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=1115)|
| 0:18:54| they do not reflect the really, you know, proven and yet innovative ideas that I'm seeing other cities implement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=1134)|
| 0:19:07| And I feel like we're missing an opportunity to truly address the poverty rate in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=1147)|
| 0:19:16| And instead, we continue to invest money in solutions that we've had access to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=1156)|
| 0:19:25| Perhaps that's just expanding it a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=1165)|
| 0:19:28| And then over here are seriously investments that are working to gentrify our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=1168)|
| 0:19:37| And they're not working to address that poverty rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=1177)|
| 0:19:40| They're working to increase housing costs, push people out of the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=1180)|
| 0:19:48| It gets the city a higher tax base, property tax base.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=1188)|
| 0:19:53| But I'm questioning that benefit to the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=1193)|
| 0:19:57| And so if we're thinking about how to address the poverty rate, we've got to get more serious than...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=1197)|
| 0:20:06| And I don't even think necessarily this criticism should be directed towards your department, but towards the resources the city's providing to address these issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=1206)|
| 0:20:16| $15,000 for an intern to come up with solutions to the poverty rate, especially in the black community, is just not going to get us there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=1216)|
| 0:20:28| We've got to take it seriously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=1228)|
| 0:20:32| Where this money could be spent and where it has been spent over the past year are these small grants that are a lifeblood to small community organizations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=1232)|
| 0:20:48| And so with that $15,000 coming out, that's even less money that those organizations will have access to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=1248)|
| 0:20:57| We're not able to get the funding from the DOJ for the violence intervention programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=1257)|
| 0:21:05| And I'm concerned where the money now is being directed in this fiscal year and in the upcoming fiscal year to actually address the poverty rates and not to continue gentrification at a rapid pace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=1265)|
| 0:21:22| And when you come in and you build infrastructure that's not coupled with the financial assistance that folks need...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=1282)|
| 0:21:30| I'm not talking about this financial empowerment center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=1290)|
| 0:21:34| That's when we get folks pushed out of their communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=1294)|
| 0:21:38| And so I'm, you know, I'm open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=1298)|
| 0:21:42| I've reached out already to try to be convinced otherwise, but, you know, please try to convince me otherwise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=1302)|
| 0:21:50| But for now, what I see are investments in a new East Knoxville that's not for the current residents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=1310)|
| 0:22:04| That's all I got.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=1324)|
| 0:22:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=1325)|
| 0:22:06| Council Member Singh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=1326)|
| 0:22:08| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=1328)|
| 0:22:10| I just wanted to thank Council Member Roberto and Councilwoman Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=1330)|
| 0:22:16| I've been requesting the administration to unbundle items for a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=1336)|
| 0:22:21| And part of the conversations that came up last week and this week are the reasons why.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=1341)|
| 0:22:26| So I continue to make that request that we be able to vote on separate items differently because there's some things that I like and there's some things that I don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=1346)|
| 0:22:35| And, yeah, I just think we'd be able to make better decisions if they were unbundled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=1355)|
| 0:22:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=1361)|
| 0:22:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=1363)|
| 0:22:44| Any further questions or discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=1364)|
| 0:22:47| Seeing none, all those in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=1367)|

| 0:22:50| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=1370)|

| 0:22:52| Motion carries 8-1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=1372)|
| 0:22:55| 9B is an ordinance to amend Article 3, Division 2, Sections 2-449 and 2-450 of the Knox City Code to adjust the classification and compensation plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=1375)|
| 0:23:05| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=1385)|

| 0:23:07| Motion made to approve and seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=1387)|
| 0:23:08| Any questions or discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=1388)|
| 0:23:10| Seeing none, all those in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=1390)|
| 0:23:12| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=1392)|
| 0:23:13| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=1393)|
| 0:23:14| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=1394)|
| 0:23:16| 9C is an ordinance to amend Chapter 2, Article 7, Division 2, Section 2-724 of the Knox City Code to authorize the police and fire chiefs, in their discretion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=1396)|
| 0:23:25| to award certain items to public safety employees separating from employment with the city after 10 years of service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=1405)|
| 0:23:31| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=1411)|
| 0:23:33| Motion made to approve and seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=1413)|
| 0:23:35| Council Member Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=1415)|
| 0:23:38| I have concerns with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=1418)|
| 0:23:40| It seems like it is a policy expansion, a policy that's already been in place, but an expansion of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=1420)|
| 0:23:54| meaning those who have been in service with the city for fewer years would now be able to receive an award.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=1434)|
| 0:24:06| But I'm extremely disturbed by a service weapon being an award that's been used in the line of duty for multiple decades.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=1446)|
| 0:24:21| And I know if this has been the culture, I'm not going to convince folks tonight that it shouldn't be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=1461)|
| 0:24:31| But I would want us to at least think on why is this a tradition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=1471)|
| 0:24:38| Let's just think on why it's a tradition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=1478)|
| 0:24:41| I'm not going to try to convince you tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=1481)|
| 0:24:43| I'm opposed to this because of the items that are able to be awarded to those in service to our city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=1483)|
| 0:24:58| That's all I have to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=1498)|
| 0:25:02| Council Member Reiner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=1502)|
| 0:25:05| I think the topic was broached.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=1505)|
| 0:25:07| Chief Noel, would you like to comment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=1507)|
| 0:25:09| Because we had no comments last week on first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=1509)|
| 0:25:13| This is second reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=1513)|
| 0:25:15| On what prompts the change to offer and what types of offerings are made to people who have less than 25 years' service since the past is 25 years?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=1515)|
| 0:25:27| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=1527)|
| 0:25:29| I've been here four months now, and we've had some officers separate, some with 17 years, some with 15 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=1529)|
| 0:25:36| And we need to do a better job of recognizing the officers that serve the Knoxville Police Department and serve our city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=1536)|
| 0:25:43| So what this does is this allows me to recognize officers, and it puts us in line with the Federal Law Enforcement Officers Safety Act,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=1543)|
| 0:25:52| which recognizes an officer being eligible for certain benefits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=1552)|
| 0:25:56| Can you speak into the microphone, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=1556)|
| 0:25:58| Certain benefits at 10 years of service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=1558)|
| 0:26:01| And, you know, I think the days of most of our officers serving 25 years and age 50, those days are dwindling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=1561)|
| 0:26:09| I hope we do hire people that want to come on and do 25, 30 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=1569)|
| 0:26:14| But I think with this new generation, we're getting more and more individuals that want to come work 10, 15 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=1574)|
| 0:26:19| We're hiring some older individuals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=1579)|
| 0:26:21| We have someone in our academy right now that's, you know, pretty old.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=1581)|
| 0:26:25| There's no way he could get 25 years of service realistically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=1585)|
| 0:26:30| So we need to do a better job of recognizing our police officers for their service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=1590)|
| 0:26:33| So what I want to be able to do with an officer that serves our city and they separate in good standing at my discretion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=1593)|
| 0:26:41| I would like to have the authority, which we do now for people with 25 years and 50 years of service, of gifting them their badge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=1601)|
| 0:26:50| which is like a memento of service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=1610)|
| 0:26:52| We don't reissue them anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=1612)|
| 0:26:53| So once an officer wears a badge, we don't give it to someone else when they separate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=1613)|
| 0:26:57| And a plaque, a plaque that would cost around $100 to $200.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=1617)|
| 0:27:00| That's what I would like to do for officers, you know, that leave with 10 or more years of service in good standing, again, with my discretion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=1620)|
| 0:27:09| And I think this is really going to help with our recruiting and retention efforts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=1629)|
| 0:27:12| Now, as long as anyone that I've spoken to can remember, the Knoxville Police Department has awarded a fully retired officer with their service weapon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=1632)|
| 0:27:22| What's fully retired?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=1642)|
| 0:27:23| 25 years and the age of 50.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=1643)|
| 0:27:26| So we're not giving a service revolver to someone retiring at 11 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=1646)|
| 0:27:30| So what I am asking for is I am not going to change that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=1650)|
| 0:27:36| So I am not going to give a weapon to someone that leaves after 10 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=1656)|
| 0:27:40| Now, I do think I would like to retain that discretion because we could have someone that becomes disabled, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=1660)|
| 0:27:47| while serving our city or, you know, maybe gets a debilitating illness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=1667)|
| 0:27:51| And I think it's, you know, I think, you know, we need to make sure we recognize people's service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=1671)|
| 0:27:57| I don't intend, if someone leaves after 12 years, of giving them their weapon under normal circumstances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=1677)|
| 0:28:02| I think it would be extraordinary circumstances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=1682)|
| 0:28:04| But I would like to retain that discretion as a memorabilia of their long service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=1684)|
| 0:28:10| The trade-in value of these weapons is really valued around $400 to $500.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=1690)|
| 0:28:14| And for fully retired officers, in 2018, we had 13.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=1694)|
| 0:28:18| In 2019, we had nine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=1698)|
| 0:28:20| In 2020, we had 13.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=1700)|
| 0:28:22| In 2021, we had 13.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=1702)|
| 0:28:24| And so far this year, we've had nine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=1704)|
| 0:28:26| That would be the amount of officers that would be eligible to receive this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=1706)|
| 0:28:31| And one other question that came up from a speaker last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=1711)|
| 0:28:35| Guns that are involved in a shooting, what happens to them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=1715)|
| 0:28:39| I mean, obviously, any gun that's in evidence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=1719)|
| 0:28:43| It stays.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=1723)|
| 0:28:44| It would be in evidence, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=1724)|
| 0:28:45| So it's not that officer's weapon to go home with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=1725)|

| 0:38:16| There are a number of items tonight related to South Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=2296)|
| 0:38:19| particularly that stem from the South Waterfront Plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=2299)|
| 0:38:22| and I just want to take a minute to applaud the vision for that plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=2302)|
| 0:38:28| the public input that was given by residents of South Knoxville for years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=2308)|
| 0:38:34| three mayors that have been committed to that South Waterfront Plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=2314)|
| 0:38:38| and a few city council bodies, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=2318)|
| 0:38:42| So I just want to thank those that came before me, particularly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=2322)|
| 0:38:45| and the commitment to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=2325)|
| 0:38:48| I also want to applaud the ability to implement a big vision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=2328)|
| 0:38:53| It's not been perfect, but it's, on the whole, been really wonderful,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=2333)|
| 0:38:57| and the development that stemmed from that didn't just stay within that form-based code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=2337)|
| 0:39:03| It goes up Chapman Highway and east and west and south Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=2343)|
| 0:39:07| So I just want to applaud that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=2347)|
| 0:39:09| There's been almost half a billion dollars invested of private dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=2349)|
| 0:39:13| as a result of that vision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=2353)|
| 0:39:14| and I'm just really grateful for leadership before me, particularly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=2354)|
| 0:39:18| and those that have supported me in continuing that vision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=2358)|
| 0:39:23| I also want to give a big shout-out to the engineering department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=2363)|
| 0:39:28| Change is hard, and it's hard to do when there are legacy neighborhoods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=2368)|
| 0:39:32| that are important to our city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=2372)|
| 0:39:33| and you all have bent over backwards to make sure that those neighborhoods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=2373)|
| 0:39:37| are protected as much as possible from new development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=2377)|
| 0:39:41| And that's not easy. It's expensive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=2381)|
| 0:39:42| It requires rework.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=2382)|
| 0:39:43| It requires lots of phone calls and e-mails,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=2383)|
| 0:39:47| but you're there to serve the people who are there now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=2387)|
| 0:39:52| so that more people can live there as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=2392)|
| 0:39:54| So I'm grateful for the city's engineering department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=2394)|
| 0:39:58| particularly for all the creative ways you've helped protect existing neighborhoods,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=2398)|
| 0:40:04| but also usher in this new level of development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=2404)|
| 0:40:07| So there's a lot of investment in the first district tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=2407)|
| 0:40:11| and I'm just really grateful and thankful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=2411)|

| 0:40:20| I wanted to ask kind of this agenda item as well as the next two agenda items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=2420)|
| 0:40:26| I had a question as far as utility companies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=2426)|
| 0:40:29| and at what point I know that in certain situations that utility companies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=2429)|
| 0:40:38| sort of cost share some of these projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=2438)|
| 0:40:41| And I know in this case,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=2441)|
| 0:40:44| KUB has already sort of helped with water and storm water| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=2444)|
| 0:40:48| and some of those at their expense,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=2448)|
| 0:40:51| but Mr. Clabo, can you kind of break down, Director Clabo, sorry,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=2451)|
| 0:40:59| sort of in what circumstances that happens, when it doesn't,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=2459)|
| 0:41:03| and then sort of in this case,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=2463)|
| 0:41:05| is there not an opportunity to actually also go back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=2465)|
| 0:41:08| and somewhat negotiate potentially on these dollars?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=2468)|
| 0:41:15| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=2475)|
| 0:41:16| I appreciate that question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=2476)|
| 0:41:18| So this particular project is the Severe Avenue Improvements Project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=2478)|
| 0:41:23| which streetscapes along Severe Avenue from Davenport to Foggy Bottom to the east.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=2483)|
| 0:41:30| So it terminates with a roundabout we're putting in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=2490)|
| 0:41:33| So that's in the area where we have a south waterfront code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=2493)|
| 0:41:38| That code requires that utilities with any city improvement project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=2498)|
| 0:41:44| the utilities are placed underground.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=2504)|
| 0:41:46| So these three items we're looking at are current aerial utilities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=2506)|
| 0:41:52| that are going to be moved to underground conduits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=2512)|
| 0:41:58| Typically with a roadway improvement project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=2518)|
| 0:42:02| we work with utilities in a typical project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=2522)|
| 0:42:07| Those utilities, it's their cost to relocate if there's conflicts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=2527)|
| 0:42:12| based on the new roadway improvements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=2532)|
| 0:42:15| If it's a project that is for aesthetics,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=2535)|
| 0:42:19| so it's more of a beautification project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=2539)|
| 0:42:22| we're wanting to move the lines from in the air to underground,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=2542)|
| 0:42:26| state law allows that utilities aren't responsible for those costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=2546)|
| 0:42:31| And so in that case, I guess in this case because of the code| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=2551)|
| 0:42:35| that requires us to put them underground| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=2555)|
| 0:42:37| and because it is a beautification project, moving them underground,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=2557)|
| 0:42:41| we bear that cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=2561)|
| 0:42:43| The three agreements you see here are really the initial aspect of that project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=2563)|
| 0:42:52| The overall project, there will also be two follow-up construction contracts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=2572)|
| 0:42:57| that we implement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=2577)|
| 0:42:59| One of those will be with relocating the utility projects,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=2579)|
| 0:43:05| and then the other is the roadway portion of that project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=2585)|
| 0:43:09| And I think we detailed in our information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=2589)|
| 0:43:12| that we expect construction to begin next year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=2592)|
| 0:43:15| but those will be bid simultaneously with utilities starting on the west end| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=2595)|
| 0:43:21| going east, the roadway contractor would be on the east end| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=2601)|
| 0:43:26| putting in some field for the roundabout area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=2606)|
| 0:43:29| and then he will jump back behind the utilities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=2609)|
| 0:43:32| to start the roadway improvements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=2612)|
| 0:43:35| So the first thing you'll see out there are these excavations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=2615)|
| 0:43:39| for the underground conduits that go in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=2619)|
| 0:43:42| We will, in this particular case,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=2622)|
| 0:43:45| there are areas where the existing utility poles,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=2625)|
| 0:43:49| and those are both KUB and AT&T poles,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=2629)|
| 0:43:53| were in conflict with some of the things that were paying like a storm sewer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=2633)|
| 0:43:57| And in that case, we will go back and negotiate with those utilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=2637)|
| 0:44:01| If they weren't going underground,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=2641)|
| 0:44:05| if they were going to just relocate aerial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=2645)|
| 0:44:08| they would have had some responsibility in moving those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=2648)|
| 0:44:11| so we can get a credit from both of those, KUB and AT&T,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=2651)|
| 0:44:16| on the cost of the utilities we're putting underground.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=2656)|
| 0:44:18| I don't know the cost of that yet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=2658)|
| 0:44:20| but we are going to be in discussions with them on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=2660)|
| 0:44:22| And then that credit would go back toward this project?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=2662)|
| 0:44:25| That's exactly right, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=2665)|
| 0:44:26| Continuation of this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=2666)|
| 0:44:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=2668)|
| 0:44:29| All right, thank you for that explanation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=2669)|
| 0:44:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=2671)|
| 0:44:32| Council Member Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=2672)|
| 0:44:38| I'll actually, no, I'll say it quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=2678)|
| 0:44:41| I just continue to be concerned with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=2681)|
| 0:44:48| having an equitable plan for investments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=2688)|
| 0:44:51| And we have a workshop about sidewalks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=2691)|
| 0:44:55| And walking away from that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=2695)|
| 0:44:58| we learned there's a whole lot of requests for sidewalks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=2698)|
| 0:45:03| But no clarity on really, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=2703)|
| 0:45:08| the plan of attack on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=2708)|
| 0:45:13| And, you know, I'd rather see a moratorium in place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=2713)|
| 0:45:17| until we could get an equitable plan in place for developments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=2717)|
| 0:45:24| Because development, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=2724)|
| 0:45:27| street skates projects that have come before us, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=2727)|
| 0:45:31| over the last several years, similar to the waterfront,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=2731)|
| 0:45:35| south side waterfront, have not moved forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=2735)|
| 0:45:37| And yet we're not having a conversation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=2737)|
| 0:45:39| about why some are moving forward and why others are not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=2739)|
| 0:45:43| And I just want that clarity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=2743)|
| 0:45:45| so I can explain that to my constituents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=2745)|
| 0:45:48| When they say, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=2748)|
| 0:45:50| oh, the city's just investing in, you know, downtown| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=2750)|
| 0:45:54| and points immediately outside of downtown,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=2754)|
| 0:45:58| I can say to them, no,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=2758)|
| 0:46:00| that is not the city lacking equity in their plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=2760)|
| 0:46:05| It's because this piece of funding came through that's available| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=2765)|
| 0:46:09| and can only be used here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=2769)|
| 0:46:11| But I don't think that's the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=2771)|
| 0:46:14| I think discretion is being used on where to allocate the funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=2774)|
| 0:46:20| And we're seeing an inequitable outcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=2780)|
| 0:46:23| And that continues to be my concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=2783)|
| 0:46:30| Thank you, Council Member Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=2790)|
| 0:46:32| I'll just have to say that these plans have been in place a long time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=2792)|
| 0:46:35| with a lot of community input, including discussions of equity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=2795)|
| 0:46:38| If you talk to people in south Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=2798)|
| 0:46:41| I think they would say that in the past they felt like they were disinvested in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=2801)|
| 0:46:45| and the city through not just my administration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=2805)|
| 0:46:49| but for previous administrations have put these plans in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=2809)|
| 0:46:53| And these large infrastructural projects take a long time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=2813)|
| 0:46:56| because of the complexities of them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=2816)|
| 0:46:59| and because of some of the stuff Council Member Smith was saying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=2819)|
| 0:47:02| to take into account the needs of the current community members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=2822)|
| 0:47:06| So I am very proud of our efforts all across the city and in south Knoxville, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=2826)|
| 0:47:11| So I just wanted to mention that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=2831)|
| 0:47:15| Any further questions or discussion on Item 11E?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=2835)|
| 0:47:21| Seeing none, all those in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=2841)|

| 0:48:44| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=2924)|
| 0:48:45| I just want to say this is a sidewalk that's been on the books| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=2925)|
| 0:48:48| for about three and a half years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=2928)|
| 0:48:50| and so in terms of sidewalks taking time, this is a good example of one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=2930)|
| 0:48:53| but nonetheless it's here and really grateful for the city seeing this through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=2933)|
| 0:48:58| It will be an immeasurable linchpin for Baker Creek| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=2938)|
| 0:49:03| and the entrance to the urban wilderness,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=2943)|
| 0:49:05| but there are a lot of folks who are mobility limited that live nearby| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=2945)|
| 0:49:09| who will benefit from this as well to access all of those amenities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=2949)|
| 0:49:12| So on behalf of the South Haven neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=2952)|
| 0:49:15| I say thank you for everyone that's going to support this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=2955)|

| 0:50:20| Councilmembers, just to echo what Councilmember Smith said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=3020)|
| 0:50:24| a lot of the items you've just been considering are part of a long-term plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=3024)|
| 0:50:29| that has been moved forward by many different community leaders,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=3029)|
| 0:50:33| councilmembers and mayors, neighborhood groups, businesses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=3033)|
| 0:50:36| and whether it's burying utility lines, building sidewalks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=3036)|
| 0:50:42| expanding the amenities and accessibility of our urban wildernesses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=3042)|
| 0:50:48| including adding bathrooms, and also improving the roadways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=3048)|
| 0:50:53| This is part of a long-term vision, and it is hard to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=3053)|
| 0:50:58| and it takes continuity of effort and continuity of vision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=3058)|
| 0:51:02| So I just want to say thank you to Councilmember Smith| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=3062)|
| 0:51:06| and your predecessors from District 1,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=3066)|
| 0:51:09| but also I do want to say that even though these are investments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=3069)|
| 0:51:12| in the South Knoxville community, it benefits all the people who go there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=3072)|
| 0:51:18| When I go to Sutree Landing, for example, it's filled with people of all ages,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=3078)|
| 0:51:22| and they are from the nearby community, but they come from other places.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=3082)|
| 0:51:27| And Baker Creek, the urban wilderness, also serves people from across the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=3087)|
| 0:51:32| and is an economic driver for people to come to Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=3092)|
| 0:51:37| and around the southeast, I would say, and beyond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=3097)|
| 0:51:40| So what's good for South Knoxville is good for Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=3100)|
| 0:51:45| It's just good for the whole community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=3105)|
| 0:51:48| So I'm really grateful for the continued support of these initiatives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=3108)|
| 0:51:53| Any other questions or discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=3113)|
| 0:51:56| Seeing none, all those in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=3116)|
| 0:51:58| Oh, I'm sorry, Ms. Parker, did you have your line on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=3118)|
| 0:52:00| I just wanted to comment that I don't think anyone is against it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=3120)|
| 0:52:04| We're all voting in favor of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=3124)|
| 0:52:05| We're all excited about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=3125)|
| 0:52:07| One caveat I would add to that, though, is I have to represent the voices| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=3127)|
| 0:52:11| of the residents who did not feel like their voices were represented| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=3131)|
| 0:52:17| through this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=3137)|
| 0:52:20| You know, I think of Sequoia Hills Park and imagining it becoming the home| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=3140)|
| 0:52:27| of the second Bell Festival.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=3147)|
| 0:52:30| That would never happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=3150)|
| 0:52:32| But when we have a low-income community, and I talk about it a lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=3152)|
| 0:52:35| because this is where I grew up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=3155)|
| 0:52:37| I grew up and went to South Knoxville Elementary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=3157)|
| 0:52:39| walked up Davenport to go home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=3159)|
| 0:52:41| And I know how poor that neighborhood is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=3161)|
| 0:52:45| I know that the folks living there cannot walk down to Sevier Avenue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=3165)|
| 0:52:50| and even afford a cup of coffee or even afford any of the establishments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=3170)|
| 0:52:57| that are there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=3177)|
| 0:53:01| So the development is not great for everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=3181)|
| 0:53:06| And we have to acknowledge that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=3186)|
| 0:53:09| We acknowledge that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=3189)|
| 0:53:11| Then we're able to invest in measures that can help ease some of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=3191)|
| 0:53:20| discomforts of the growth that's happening over there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=3200)|
| 0:53:24| Well, you know, growth that's purposeful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=3204)|
| 0:53:29| It's not natural growth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=3209)|
| 0:53:30| It's purposeful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=3210)|
| 0:53:31| It was targeted and created into this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=3211)|
| 0:53:35| And there was a lot of public input that helped design that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=3215)|
| 0:53:38| but there was a lot of public input that fell on deaf ears.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=3218)|
| 0:53:42| And so now they're surrounded by this playground that everybody is able| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=3222)|
| 0:53:46| to visit when other neighborhoods we know would never allow that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=3226)|
| 0:53:52| So we have to be sensitive to that and not act as if those voices don't exist| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=3232)|
| 0:53:58| is all I'm saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=3238)|
| 0:53:59| And as if the neighborhoods that feed into Sevier Avenue are not so poor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=3239)|
| 0:54:06| that they can't afford these types of entertainment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=3246)|
| 0:54:12| We've got to recognize that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=3252)|
| 0:54:13| That's all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=3253)|

| 0:58:05| Ms. Owens could come forward, our purchasing agent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=3485)|
| 0:58:08| You can speak to any and all questions on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=3488)|
| 0:58:17| Hello.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=3497)|
| 0:58:18| Penny Owens, purchasing agent for the City of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=3498)|
| 0:58:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=3501)|
| 0:58:22| Could you give us an overview of how it would work to utilize this pricing established by this program?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=3502)|
| 0:58:31| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=3511)|
| 0:58:32| So with all the cooperatives, the national cooperatives like that, those are competed just the same way that we would compete them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=3512)|
| 0:58:41| but they are done by another local agency somewhere in the United States.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=3521)|
| 0:58:46| And then we only typically use those in a case where maybe we have market conditions where we can't get anything locally| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=3526)|
| 0:58:56| or we find that they might have some specialty item that we would need that we wouldn't be able to probably obtain if we bid it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=3536)|
| 0:59:06| We also use them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=3546)|
| 0:59:08| Up until a couple weeks ago, we were quite shorthanded in purchasing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=3548)|
| 0:59:12| so we did use them a little bit more when we were shorthanded just for a measurement of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=3552)|
| 0:59:18| But I will tell you one of the things we do look at before we use one is our DVE community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=3558)|
| 0:59:23| So we absolutely try to avoid those at all costs if we have DVE firms out that we know are available and can provide the products and services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=3563)|
| 0:59:34| Do you have that written in policy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=3574)|
| 0:59:38| I think it's in our procurement policy, but I can't remember off the top of my head.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=3578)|
| 0:59:43| I would have to look.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=3583)|
| 0:59:45| We only use these, as I said, sparingly, and so kind of looking over the past probably about a year and a half,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=3585)|
| 0:59:51| we've probably used them about 6% of the time for all of our total POs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=3591)|
| 0:59:56| So they are used quite sparingly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=3596)|
| 1:00:00| Are there any policies in place that restrict the use?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=3600)|
| 1:00:06| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=3606)|
| 1:00:07| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=3607)|
| 1:00:08| That's just my one concern is how often it would be used.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=3608)|
| 1:00:20| I really appreciate what you have shared about DVEs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=3620)|
| 1:00:24| I would feel better if it were in the policy, but I just would feel better if this had some constraints on it where it was clearly laid out that the system would only be used under these circumstances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=3624)|
| 1:00:43| Like I said, we do kind of have internal criteria, and I am the keeper of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=3643)|
| 1:00:50| Everybody has to come through me before I say we can use a cooperative, and those do run through our office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=3650)|
| 1:00:56| So the departments cannot just go off and buy off a cooperative without our intervention on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=3656)|
| 1:01:04| Thank you for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=3664)|
| 1:01:05| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=3665)|

| 1:02:06| When I signed up to speak tonight, again, I had to think how I would respond to the question in favor or oppose, and, of course, I'm in favor of the Juneteenth celebration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=3726)|
| 1:02:26| I just want to make sure that our city, the people who live in our city, the people here tonight, all of you all as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=3746)|
| 1:02:49| that we're celebrating this holiday for the right reasons, not because it's a good look or it'll get us a couple of votes or it might appease a few friends.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=3769)|
| 1:03:11| I think that we need to just really stop and think through what Emancipation Day is truly about, and I know that you all may think I am a foolish white woman standing up here talking about an African American holiday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=3791)|
| 1:03:39| As you say, Mayor, it is a holiday deserving a celebration by all Americans, and so maybe I'm not so foolish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=3819)|
| 1:03:55| Of course, we all know what Juneteenth signifies, 1865, Galveston, Texas, the ending of slavery,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=3835)|
| 1:04:13| but as long as we still condone certain behaviors in our society, and that's right here in Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=3853)|
| 1:04:30| as long as we don't take the time to listen to one another and not be competitive or vindictive or I gotcha all the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=3870)|
| 1:04:45| Tonight, earlier today when I was speaking to a friend, and I said I was going to attend the meeting tonight just to listen in because I think it's important for so many of us who have privilege to look like me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=3885)|
| 1:05:04| and come here tonight, come here and just listen to the business of our city, this friend asked me, so you're going to jam them up tonight, huh?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=3904)|
| 1:05:21| And I didn't really, that is not my intent, that is never my intent, it should never be anyone's intent when they come to this podium to jam you all up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=3921)|
| 1:05:37| It is not a competition, it is not a gotcha moment, and Juneteenth is so special, and so long, long, long overdue, the meaning behind it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=3937)|
| 1:06:02| I just think it's very important that we realize as long as the behaviors that I mentioned, the inequities, the racial and social inequities that still occur in our country, in our county, in our city, that Juneteenth cannot be a celebration for all Americans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=3962)|
| 1:06:29| And that's all I really wanted to say about that for right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=3989)|
| 1:06:32| I appreciate your time, and I appreciate those of you who look at me when I speak, who have, who I can make eye contact with, and I think that's important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=3992)|

| 1:08:50| As a result of that litigation, the Tennessee Supreme Court decided a case that said that any ordinance which impacts the use of land within the City of Knoxville before it can be considered by the City Council in order for it to be a valid ordinance has to go first to the Planning Commission for its consideration and recommendation and then come to Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=4130)|
| 1:09:14| Procedurally, the proper motion would be to refer this matter to Planning for its consideration and recommendation back to the Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=4154)|
| 1:09:23| Thank you for that. I'll do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=4163)|
| 1:09:26| Tom, when it comes hopefully back to us, we'll be able to discuss it as a group, but for now I'll withdraw my motion to approve and amend it to refer this to Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=4166)|
| 1:09:35| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=4175)|
| 1:09:37| Substitute motion is to refer this to Planning Commission. It's been made and seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=4177)|
| 1:09:42| Council Member Parker, did you have a question or comment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=4182)|
| 1:09:47| I have no objections to this and I would hope that this is something that could go before Planning Commission and not be too much of a lift for them to review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=4187)|
| 1:10:02| But I will say in terms of having fair, just, equitable processes, I have other items for consideration for planning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=4202)|
| 1:10:18| And I met with Planning recently to talk about their work priorities for next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=4218)|
| 1:10:26| And so I know the mayors will have a lot to weigh in on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=4226)|
| 1:10:34| And so I would just ask my colleagues if we could have some sort of space for us to discuss what we might want to send to Planning to review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=4234)|
| 1:10:45| Maybe, you know, Council Member Smith and I are the only ones, and so we can just bring our items as we see fit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=4245)|
| 1:10:52| But if there are multiple items, it would be good for us to have space to discuss that so that we have a good sense of, you know, what we're sending to Planning next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=4252)|
| 1:11:07| That's my request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=4267)|
| 1:11:10| Any other questions or discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=4270)|
| 1:11:14| Seeing none, all those in favor, please say aye. Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=4274)|
| 1:11:17| Any opposed? Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=4277)|
| 1:11:21| Okay, next is public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=4281)|
| 1:11:25| The first person signed up to speak, we have three people signed up to speak at public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=4285)|
| 1:11:30| First is Doyle Hurst, also Tyra Von Shade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=4290)|
| 1:11:36| If you could come to the podium, state your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=4296)|
| 1:11:39| Hello there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=4299)|
| 1:11:40| My name is Doyle Hurst.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=4300)|
| 1:11:41| I live at 316 Service Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=4301)|
| 1:11:43| That's Knoxville, Tennessee, 37920.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=4303)|
| 1:11:48| You can also call me Tyra Von Shade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=4308)|
| 1:11:50| I'm a prominent entertainer in the southeastern region based here out of Knoxville, Tennessee, and a member of the LGBTQIA plus community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=4310)|
| 1:11:58| I am the host and co-host of many events in the area and surrounding areas, some events 21 and up, some events 18 and up, some events all ages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=4318)|
| 1:12:07| And recently, myself and many of my peers in the city and many surrounding areas have been targeted and attacked by radicals with no backing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=4327)|
| 1:12:13| wrongfully accusing us of being predators, pedophiles, a satanic cult, child groomers, and more all the while.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=4333)|
| 1:12:19| We're doing absolutely nothing wrong and trying our best to continue spreading love and light within this community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=4339)|
| 1:12:24| The leaders of these attacks are the same people that were at the January 6th insurrection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=4344)|
| 1:12:28| They're the same people that destroyed our Planned Parenthood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=4348)|
| 1:12:31| They're a minority, but they're well organized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=4351)|
| 1:12:34| These attacks and the follow through from the businesses agreeing to cancel some of our events is a direct violation of the First Amendment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=4354)|
| 1:12:40| which is our freedom of expression.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=4360)|
| 1:12:42| They're saying any establishment that hosts a drag show is an adult-oriented establishment, and this is simply not true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=4362)|
| 1:12:48| The Tennessee Theater is going to host a drag show.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=4368)|
| 1:12:51| Does that make them an adult-oriented entertainment venue?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=4371)|
| 1:12:56| IM's Nature Center wanted to host a drag show.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=4376)|
| 1:12:58| Would they be considered an adult entertainment venue?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=4378)|
| 1:13:03| Their basis on these attacks is in reference to Tennessee Code 7-51-1401,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=4383)|
| 1:13:10| which compares drag to that of cabaret, among many other things that are not accurate representations of what drag is today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=4390)|
| 1:13:18| This code even states that it's against the law for a drag show to happen within 1,000 feet of a church.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=4398)|
| 1:13:26| They're trying to have a lot of events canceled due to them being all ages,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=4406)|
| 1:13:30| and even though nothing suggestive happens at any of these events, they seem to believe otherwise,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=4410)|
| 1:13:34| and I'm sure you're aware of a lot of the blue laws that we have to follow in places that we sell food and alcohol and allow all ages to come inside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=4414)|
| 1:13:40| There are a lot of laws and restrictions on things that we can and cannot wear,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=4420)|
| 1:13:44| movements that we can and cannot make onstage and offstage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=4424)|
| 1:13:49| a lot of precautionary measures that we take.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=4429)|
| 1:13:52| You can see all of these things on the TABC and Tennessee.gov websites,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=4432)|
| 1:13:56| and especially at all-ages shows, we do a lot of things to make sure that suggestive things or inappropriate things are not happening,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=4436)|
| 1:14:05| like tip buckets to avoid hand-to-hand tipping,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=4445)|
| 1:14:07| group chats prior to all of these events to make sure that all of the music and all of the entertainment that we're going to provide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=4447)|
| 1:14:14| is content that we can prepare for an all-ages show that's appropriate for anybody to view,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=4454)|
| 1:14:21| among a list of a lot of other precautionary measures that we take.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=4461)|
| 1:14:24| And amidst all this, the purpose of these events is to provide a safe space for people that are different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=4464)|
| 1:14:29| The IM show that we were going to have was simply to link the community with art and with the Nature Center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=4469)|
| 1:14:35| and I think all people in America and in our city deserve access to public art and music and performance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=4475)|
| 1:14:40| and drag is all of that. Drag is art. And art is not a crime.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=4480)|
| 1:14:45| Need I even talk about the importance of music and dance and art and their impact on modern culture,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=4485)|
| 1:14:49| because those things are very, very important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=4489)|
| 1:14:53| Not to mention the possible revenue brought to local and small-owned businesses that planned on having these shows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=4493)|
| 1:14:58| Drag entertainers, we are the cheerleader of our own community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=4498)|
| 1:15:02| We try to bring joy for everyone, and when you're working within different communities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=4502)|
| 1:15:06| different precautions have to be taken, and we understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=4506)|
| 1:15:09| We're not simple people. A lot of us are very highly intelligent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=4509)|
| 1:15:13| I invite any of you to attend any of our all-ages shows,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=4513)|
| 1:15:17| and see for yourself that we're harmlessly supporting art and minority communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=4517)|
| 1:15:21| In closing, I just ask that you look back at the Tennessee state codes and laws,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=4521)|
| 1:15:26| and when and if you do so decide to enforce them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=4526)|
| 1:15:30| please mind that a lot of these are coded with transphobic verbiage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=4530)|
| 1:15:35| A lot of these laws and codes classify drag as cabaret or male and female impersonation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=4535)|
| 1:15:40| but who even gets to draw that line?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=4540)|
| 1:15:43| People that have no prior knowledge at all of drag or its history,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=4543)|
| 1:15:46| and I'd like to think that that's not the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=4546)|
| 1:15:49| Drag is not cabaret, and all drag is not the same, and drag is not dangerous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=4549)|
| 1:15:53| I look forward to continue bringing art and joy to my community in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=4553)|
| 1:15:57| Thank you for listening to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=4557)|
| 1:16:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=4560)|
| 1:16:02| The next person signed up to speak is Jackson Ball.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=4562)|
| 1:16:06| You come to the podium and state your name and address for the record,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=4566)|
| 1:16:10| and you'll have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=4570)|
| 1:16:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=4577)|
| 1:16:19| My name is Jackson Ball.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=4579)|
| 1:16:21| I reside at 6437 Hubert Bean Road, Fountain City in Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=4581)|
| 1:16:27| I've come before you to sort of, I'm not very well versed, I do apologize,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=4587)|
| 1:16:34| to kind of play off of what my friend Doyle Hurst just spoke about regarding the trans community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=4594)|
| 1:16:42| Drag has done so much for me personally as an open and out trans queer person in this community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=4602)|
| 1:16:54| and if it weren't for drag, I wouldn't be able to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=4614)|
| 1:16:57| I would not have been able to fulfill my true potential as a human being on this planet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=4617)|
| 1:17:03| And dating back to drag history, we're talking like the 15th and 16th century,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=4623)|
| 1:17:13| especially over in Europe, William Shakespeare's times,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=4633)|
| 1:17:18| their plays were consisted entirely of men.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=4638)|
| 1:17:22| Men who wore dresses, wigs, makeup, heels, the whole nine yards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=4642)|
| 1:17:28| It was socially acceptable in those times,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=4648)|
| 1:17:31| and now radical Christians have made it to where it's not socially acceptable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=4651)|
| 1:17:39| or were looked at as freaks, weirdos, what have you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=4659)|
| 1:17:46| As part of the human nature, we dislike or fear what we don't understand,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=4666)|
| 1:17:52| and that is what we try to do as members of the queer community and in the drag community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=4672)|
| 1:18:00| is that we are trying to educate and entertain, among other things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=4680)|
| 1:18:07| And I grew up in a very religious background.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=4687)|
| 1:18:11| My father was a deacon of a southern Baptist church.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=4691)|
| 1:18:15| My father's brother was also a Baptist preacher,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=4695)|
| 1:18:19| and my grandfather is also a Baptist preacher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=4699)|
| 1:18:22| So I understand standing up for your beliefs and trying to spread the word,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=4702)|
| 1:18:30| but if what you believe in is causing you to have hateful behaviors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=4710)|
| 1:18:40| then it's kind of like you should take a step back and look at your beliefs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=4720)|
| 1:18:46| and see if it's harming the community, such as the LGBT community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=4726)|
| 1:18:53| it's just, I don't know how else to describe it, but not fair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=4733)|
| 1:19:00| Let's see, I have another.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=4740)|
| 1:19:03| So back in 2019, I discovered what drag was for the first time officially,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=4743)|
| 1:19:12| like in person, aside from what you would see on television,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=4752)|
| 1:19:16| and it gave me the confidence to try it myself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=4756)|
| 1:19:21| and it did so many wonderful things for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=4761)|
| 1:19:25| I developed so many wonderful friendships because of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=4765)|
| 1:19:28| And fast-forwarding to fall of 2020,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=4768)|
| 1:19:33| because of the love and support that I received from the drag community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=4773)|
| 1:19:38| I became known as, I don't know how else to describe it, I do apologize,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=4778)|
| 1:19:44| I'm not very well-versed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=4784)|
| 1:19:48| I was able, I had the courage to come out as the proud transgender man that I am,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=4788)|
| 1:19:55| and the rest was history since then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=4795)|
| 1:20:00| And like I said, if it weren't for drag, I wouldn't be the person I am today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=4800)|
| 1:20:05| and what drag does for the society,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=4805)|
| 1:20:14| playing off of what he had just said, it brings money in for businesses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=4814)|
| 1:20:20| and it does so many wonderful things for the youth in the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=4820)|
| 1:20:26| I have never experienced a more loving group of individuals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=4826)|
| 1:20:31| than I have with drag artists.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=4831)|
| 1:20:35| Recently, myself and Doyle, or Tyra Von Shade,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=4835)|
| 1:20:40| we performed at Knox Pride, and it was one of the most loving| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=4840)|
| 1:20:44| and wonderful and accepting experiences I think I've ever experienced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=4844)|
| 1:20:48| So, that being said, thank you for listening to what I had to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=4848)|
| 1:20:53| Have a wonderful evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=4853)|
| 1:20:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=4856)|
| 1:20:58| The next person signed up to speak is Tina Sparks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=4858)|
| 1:21:18| Tina Sparks, Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=4878)|
| 1:21:21| I don't really have a whole lot to say except for Anthony Thompson Jr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=4881)|
| 1:21:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=4898)|
| 1:21:41| Thank you, Anthony Thompson Jr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=4901)|
| 1:21:45| I cannot not say his name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=4905)|
| 1:21:58| I know that I have brought this to your attention on more than one occasion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=4918)|
| 1:22:08| and I know to a lot of people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=4928)|
| 1:22:14| this is something they cannot comprehend,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=4934)|
| 1:22:25| but the events that led to the murder of Anthony Thompson Jr. in the bathroom last April,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=4945)|
| 1:22:43| I don't see a whole lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=4963)|
| 1:22:45| I know you've only been here four months,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=4965)|
| 1:22:50| but you had to have had prior knowledge of what had happened here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=4970)|
| 1:22:57| in the process of the search that took place for the police chief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=4977)|
| 1:23:04| You had to be aware of how volatile, how personal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=4984)|
| 1:23:11| how deeply the community, the families, the children,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=4991)|
| 1:23:22| were affected by what happened in that bathroom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=5002)|
| 1:23:28| And at the last park meeting, I spoke to this again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=5008)|
| 1:23:42| and I asked you the question that night,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=5022)|
| 1:23:47| and I asked you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=5027)|
| 1:23:50| do you really, truly believe that there was no other way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=5030)|
| 1:23:58| for then-Officer Clabo, now Detective Clabo,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=5038)|
| 1:24:04| to have resolved that issue?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=5044)|
| 1:24:12| It just goes to speak to what I spoke to earlier| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=5052)|
| 1:24:18| about recognizing the importance of speaking, doing, showing up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=5058)|
| 1:24:36| for the reasons, just because it's the thing to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=5076)|
| 1:24:39| not because it's, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=5079)|
| 1:24:42| that it is going to earn you some kind of points with someone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=5082)|
| 1:24:51| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=5091)|
| 1:24:53| But do you really, truly, in your heart,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=5093)|
| 1:24:56| I'm saying this again, in your heart,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=5096)|
| 1:24:59| do you really think Officer Clabo was equipped to handle that situation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=5099)|
| 1:25:07| And if you do, in your heart, believe that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=5107)|
| 1:25:12| then we are in a lot of trouble in the city of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=5112)|
| 1:25:20| if our police chief believes that that young man had to be murdered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=5120)|
| 1:25:28| to bring that situation to an end,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=5128)|
| 1:25:34| and the way in which it happened,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=5134)|
| 1:25:36| and the total disregard, lack of respect,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=5136)|
| 1:25:46| lack of sensitivity that occurred,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=5146)|
| 1:25:52| not just in that bathroom, but outside Austin East| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=5152)|
| 1:25:58| in the following days, here in this room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=5158)|
| 1:26:07| Chief, I want to like you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=5167)|
| 1:26:11| I want to trust you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=5171)|
| 1:26:13| I cannot trust you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=5173)|
| 1:26:16| I have very little trust in our police force.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=5176)|
| 1:26:22| Anthony Thompson, Jr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=5182)|
| 1:26:24| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=5184)|
| 1:26:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=5186)|
| 1:26:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=5187)|
| 1:26:28| Council members, that concludes public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=5188)|
| 1:26:30| And without objection, this meeting is adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221018?start=5190)|
