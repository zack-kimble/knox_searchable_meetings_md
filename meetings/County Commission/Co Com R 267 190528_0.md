| 0:04:05| We did first offense, and we paid penalty for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=245)|

| 0:04:50| Okay. Do you have any other relationship with the property owner other than just leasing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=290)|
| 0:04:56| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=296)|

| 0:05:47| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=347)|
| 0:05:48| Mr. Armstrong, I don't think he answered question number one that you asked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=348)|
| 0:05:52| He answered an unrelated question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=352)|
| 0:05:55| Yeah. He was, I can repeat it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=355)|
| 0:05:59| It would be a yes or no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=359)|
| 0:06:06| Have you or any of your employees at this particular location been convicted of any violation of the laws against possession,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=366)|
| 0:06:13| sale, manufacture, or transportation of intoxicating liquors or a crime involving moral turpitude within the past ten years?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=373)|
| 0:06:21| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=381)|
| 0:06:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=382)|
| 0:06:23| Okay. Thank you. Commissioner Smith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=383)|
| 0:06:26| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=386)|
| 0:06:28| Sir, the lady's name who was deleted from the ownership on the application, she is not a shareholder in your corporation, is she?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=388)|
| 0:06:35| Not anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=395)|
| 0:06:40| Okay. Commissioner Anderson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=400)|
| 0:06:42| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=402)|
| 0:06:43| So why are you changing the setup of this store?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=403)|
| 0:06:49| It leads me to believe that you've got a first conviction, you don't want a second conviction, so it's a little bit of an insurance policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=409)|
| 0:06:56| Why are you changing the ownership?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=416)|
| 0:06:59| So when we started the store, as it is in the corporation right now, we were three shareholders initially,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=419)|
| 0:07:08| and one of the shareholders resigned from the corporation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=428)|
| 0:07:12| and so we were advised from Knox County clerk that we should reapply for the beer license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=432)|
| 0:07:20| Was the one that resigned, is that the one that sold the alcohol to the miner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=440)|
| 0:07:23| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=443)|
| 0:07:24| Is that person that sold the alcohol to the miner still employed at your store?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=444)|
| 0:07:27| She is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=447)|
| 0:07:28| Was she convicted in General Sessions Court or did she get plead guilty?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=448)|
| 0:07:35| What did she plead?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=455)|
| 0:07:37| She plead guilty and she had to retake the exam again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=457)|
| 0:07:45| Is it dismissed from her record?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=465)|
| 0:07:48| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=468)|
| 0:07:49| It is dismissed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=469)|
| 0:07:50| If she's not dismissed from her record, she can't sell alcohol there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=470)|
| 0:07:55| If she's convicted of selling to a miner, she can't sell for a certain period of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=475)|
| 0:07:59| Is she convicted or not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=479)|
| 0:08:02| As I understand, she was not prohibited from selling the alcohol, but just to retake the course and report in 90 days back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=482)|
| 0:08:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=490)|
| 0:08:11| I'll make a motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=491)|
| 0:08:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=495)|
| 0:08:16| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=496)|
| 0:08:17| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=497)|
| 0:08:18| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=498)|
| 0:08:19| There's a motion for approval by Commissioner Anders with a second from Commissioner Beeler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=499)|

| 0:20:03| you, Mr. Chairman. I know yesterday was Memorial Day and I just felt like we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=1203)|
| 0:20:11| should let it spill into today. So my devotion is about that because every day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=1211)|
| 0:20:20| we should remember those who are serving us and those who have lost their lives| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=1220)|
| 0:20:26| and to protect our freedom. That's the reason why we get to sit up here today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=1226)|
| 0:20:32| and why we get a choice to be able to vote in our elections. So this is my| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=1232)|
| 0:20:39| prayer for today. Heavenly Father, today is yours and we ask you to bless and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=1239)|
| 0:20:46| strengthen those brave souls who selfishly give of themselves without| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=1246)|
| 0:20:52| asking anything in return. We ask you to heal our wounded warriors who returned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=1252)|
| 0:20:57| home in pain after they gave their all for this great land. Bless them. Restore| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=1257)|
| 0:21:04| their souls. Heal their bodies. Bring salvation to the lost. Father, we ask you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=1264)|
| 0:21:10| to bless the families of our military who stay behind while their loved ones| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=1270)|
| 0:21:16| go into battle. Keep them safe and provide for their needs according to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=1276)|
| 0:21:21| your abundance. Lord, we pray for a special blessing upon the families| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=1281)|
| 0:21:26| whose loved one gave his or her life to this country. Keep them safe and comfort| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=1286)|
| 0:21:32| their hearts. Lord, we ask you to anoint our chaplains and others who bring the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=1292)|
| 0:21:37| word to our military. It is also my prayer that we remember their sacrifice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=1297)|
| 0:21:44| and the precious gift of freedom every day, not just once a year or when they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=1304)|
| 0:21:49| are in danger of being taken away. There are encroachments being made on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=1309)|
| 0:21:55| our freedoms right now by those who think they know better. Let peace| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=1315)|
| 0:22:00| prevail among all the nations. Oh God, especially let your mercy rest upon our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=1320)|
| 0:22:06| land. Even as we acknowledge with thanksgiving your past goodness of this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=1326)|
| 0:22:11| country. It is your will, if it is your will, preserve the lives of the men and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=1331)|
| 0:22:17| women in uniform as they defend our citizenry. Let our military brothers and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=1337)|
| 0:22:23| sisters feel our love and support. Father, we ask you to forgive the sins| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=1343)|

| 0:22:39| these difficult times. We ask you to forgive our pride as a nation and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=1359)|

| 0:23:09| Commissioner Jay, would you please lead us maybe with a little assistance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=1389)|
| 0:23:14| tonight in the pledge of allegiance to our nation's flag? Thank you, Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=1394)|
| 0:23:18| Chairman. Tonight we are really, really happy to be joined by Girl Scout| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=1398)|

| 0:23:29| to join us and lead the pledge, led by Miss Iris.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=1409)|
| 0:23:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=1419)|
| 0:24:06| Thank you, Mr J. Do you know if they'd like to get a picture made| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=1446)|
| 0:24:09| up here, or would that be? Okay. All right. Okay. Great job, Girl Scouts. We| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=1449)|
| 0:24:20| are now at the part of our commission agenda, which is called public forum. For| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=1460)|
| 0:24:24| our guests, any member of the community who would like to address the county has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=1464)|
| 0:24:30| the opportunity to do so. I have a list of three folks who have signed up in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=1470)|
| 0:24:34| advance. I'm going to ask each to approach the podium, state your name and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=1474)|
| 0:24:38| address for the record, and you'll have five minutes. The first is Miss Vivian| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=1478)|
| 0:24:44| Schein.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=1484)|
| 0:24:54| Good evening, Vivian Schein, 109 South Gallaher View, Knoxville, 37919. Before I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=1494)|
| 0:25:01| began, Carson had asked me to say something about the census, and I wanted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=1501)|
| 0:25:06| to share that information. The census is in 2020. However, there's been great| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=1506)|
| 0:25:12| growth in the last 10 years. We need people beginning in 2019 now, this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=1512)|
| 0:25:17| summer, to be address canvassers to help us fix the maps. So we are hiring. The| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=1517)|
| 0:25:23| jobs are starting. They begin at $15.50 up to $27 an hour. You're paid weekly. It| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=1523)|
| 0:25:29| is very important that we have people to help us fix the maps, and also count the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=1529)|
| 0:25:33| people next year. This is a $675 billion census, and everyone we don't count is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=1533)|
| 0:25:40| $1,091 per person that you're going to lose federal dollars in your communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=1540)|
| 0:25:45| In the last census, we were greatly undercounted. These dollars affect our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=1545)|
| 0:25:51| federal roads, our hospitals, our schools, our lunch programs, Head Starts. As you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=1551)|
| 0:25:58| know, in the last 10 years, I believe there have been at least 10 hospitals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=1558)|
| 0:26:01| that have closed. So please, we're asking you to apply to help us count the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=1561)|
| 0:26:06| people, and then next year, when they do come to the door, we're asking you to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=1566)|
| 0:26:10| open the door. Thank you. Would you reset this clock? I asked her to do that, if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=1570)|
| 0:26:15| you would. Sure. Reset to five minutes. Reset to five minutes, please. Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=1575)|
| 0:26:20| Thank you. Thank you. Good evening. On June 6, you will vote on the budget for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=1580)|
| 0:26:28| next year. Last week, you heard the proposal that the indigent care would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=1588)|
| 0:26:32| cut by 30%. This cut was presented to you, ready to go, all wrapped up in a pretty| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=1592)|
| 0:26:40| package, with a gift card that said, it's okay to cut the funding to those who| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=1600)|
| 0:26:46| provide care to the poorest of the poor. They're okay with it, and nothing's going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=1606)|
| 0:26:50| to change. Before I tell you what is really in this box, let me put a face on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=1610)|
| 0:26:55| this cost we're talking about. Those who would have you believe that these souls| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=1615)|
| 0:27:00| are worthless. Let me tell you of an indigent soul, one of those 1,100, and one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=1620)|
| 0:27:06| of those served by Cherokee Health. A young woman with four boys, herself a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=1626)|
| 0:27:11| caregiver for many years, working as a CNA, not making a lot of money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=1631)|
| 0:27:16| tirelessly working for long hours at nursing homes and rehab centers, small in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=1636)|
| 0:27:22| frame, lifting and cleaning and caring for others. Then she herself becomes ill,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=1642)|
| 0:27:27| no longer able to work, no health insurance, income below $500. Indigent by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=1647)|
| 0:27:36| the definition. In pain, now on a walker, desperately searching for that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=1656)|
| 0:27:43| surgeon who will take her case and help her so she can return to working and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=1663)|
| 0:27:47| being a hard-working citizen of Knox County, so she can raise her sons on her| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=1667)|
| 0:27:53| feet and not in a wheelchair that she is destined to be in if the surgery is not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=1673)|
| 0:27:58| done. If you cut this budget, she and others like her will fall through the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=1678)|
| 0:28:04| cracks, for these providers will not be able to keep on doing more with less.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=1684)|
| 0:28:10| Providers like Cherokee, whom I pray you will not cut 43% of their funding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=1690)|
| 0:28:15| tonight. It is obvious it's not okay. Why else would the providers have asked you for an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=1695)|
| 0:28:21| additional $200,000 in a more than $830 million budget? I, too, want the people of Knoxville to know through the written press, through television, through radio, through social media, to know the facts. The facts are the indigent will be hurt by these cuts. You see, wrapped around that neat little budget proposal was a handkerchief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=1701)|
| 0:28:44| That handkerchief is given to you for you to wipe your hands of the care of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=1724)|
| 0:28:49| least of us who currently lie at your feet, having been cast there by the words| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=1729)|
| 0:28:54| in this budget proposal. I submit to you that on June 6, one of three things is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=1734)|
| 0:28:59| going to happen. Scene 1, the mayor will step up and change his request for cuts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=1739)|
| 0:29:04| to the budget to the poor and will give the $200,000 increase, for that is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=1744)|
| 0:29:08| truly the right thing to do. Scene 2, you will take this handkerchief and wipe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=1748)|
| 0:29:13| your hands of these, our brothers and sisters, who need help and step over them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=1753)|
| 0:29:19| and go on with your lives, having believed a lie that everything is going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=1759)|
| 0:29:22| to be okay. Or scene 3, you'll take this handkerchief, put it back in the box,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=1762)|
| 0:29:27| along with the budget proposal that was given to you, and send it back to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=1767)|
| 0:29:32| mayor. I submit to you, we are the community and we accept the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=1772)|
| 0:29:37| responsibility. He says the responsibility is not the government. Well, we are the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=1777)|
| 0:29:42| government. You are the elected body of this community. Send the budget back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=1782)|
| 0:29:50| Thank you. Next who's signed up for public forum is David Hayes. David, if you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=1790)|
| 0:29:57| could please approach the podium. Is David here? I think he had called into| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=1797)|
| 0:30:03| the office. Well, we've got two Davids have signed up. So, you're David Waite, is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=1803)|
| 0:30:13| that right? White. Yeah, okay. All right, go ahead and approach the podium, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=1813)|
| 0:30:18| David Hayes, if he arrives here later tonight, we will have another public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=1818)|
| 0:30:22| forum at the end of the evening if you'd like to make a statement. Yeah, I haven't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=1822)|
| 0:30:26| seen David. Okay, go ahead. I'm David Waite and I reside at 1011 Ledgerwood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=1826)|
| 0:30:35| Avenue here in Knoxville, in District 2. I own the house and I also have rental| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=1835)|
| 0:30:41| property in that district. I also rise to talk about the, I think it's item| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=1841)|
| 0:30:46| 39 on your agenda tonight, this proposal to reduce the funding for indigent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=1846)|
| 0:30:53| care. I spoke about that at the workshop. I'm not going to repeat the arguments I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=1853)|
| 0:30:57| made at that time and I certainly can't make any more articulate argument than| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=1857)|
| 0:31:02| the one that was just made to you. But I did want to talk about it because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=1862)|
| 0:31:07| something that concerns me is it appears, from our point of view anyway, out here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=1867)|
| 0:31:13| that what's happened is there's been a proposal to, in the face of a request for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=1873)|
| 0:31:19| an increase in funding, a proposal to significantly reduce funding without any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=1879)|
| 0:31:26| apparent effort to try to cooperate with anyone else on trying to solve the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=1886)|
| 0:31:32| budgetary problems of these health care providers. I speak in particular of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=1892)|
| 0:31:38| city. At the workshop, the issue was raised that many of the indigent who are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=1898)|
| 0:31:43| cared for actually reside in the city and that the city isn't making any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=1903)|
| 0:31:48| contribution. So it would seem to me, from my seat, that the appropriate thing to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=1908)|
| 0:31:55| before cutting this budget is to approach the city, and perhaps any other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=1915)|
| 0:32:00| agency that might be approached, to try and resolve the funding problems of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=1920)|
| 0:32:05| these agencies in a cooperative manner, which may very well lead to a cut in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=1925)|
| 0:32:11| funding by the county, but if it's done in cooperation with the city and some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=1931)|
| 0:32:16| other agencies, it might be done in such a way that the health care providers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=1936)|
| 0:32:21| will not suffer as a result of the county's budget cut. Thank you very much| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=1941)|
| 0:32:27| for your time. I appreciate you. Okay, thank you. Okay, that concludes everyone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=1947)|
| 0:32:33| who signed up in advance for the public forum tonight, so I'm now going to move| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=1953)|
| 0:32:37| on to the rest of the agenda. And next up we have a number of honorary resolutions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=1957)|
| 0:32:44| So, Madam Clerk. The first is consideration of a resolution of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=1964)|
| 0:32:50| Commission of North County, Tennessee honoring Inskip Baptist Church upon the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=1970)|
| 0:32:54| occasion of its 100th anniversary. This is Resolution 101. Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=1974)|
| 0:33:02| Okay, we have a motion by Commissioner Anders, with a second from Commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=1982)|
| 0:33:05| Schoonmaker, and it was sponsored by Commissioner Carringer, who is now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=1985)|
| 0:33:08| approaching the podium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=1988)|
| 0:33:14| I feel like the process is right. Come on down, Inskip Baptist. Just a few words.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=1994)|
| 0:33:27| Reverend Mike Seegers is the pastor at Inskip Baptist, and he is unable to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=2007)|
| 0:33:33| here with us. He's on vacation with his family, and as you all will recall, he's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=2013)|
| 0:33:39| done devotion for me in the past, and he is also Carolyn and Tom Jensen's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=2019)|
| 0:33:45| son-in-law. So this is his church, which is also in my district, and I'm just so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=2025)|
| 0:33:53| honored and so excited to be able to do this, to recognize them for a hundred| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=2033)|
| 0:33:59| years. Wow, doesn't that speak how good God is? And we give him all the glory| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=2039)|
| 0:34:05| that there has been a church right there in the midst of a residential area for a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=2045)|
| 0:34:12| hundred years. That is so, that's just so amazing to think about, all the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=2052)|
| 0:34:23| things that have gone on there in the service and the hours that's been devoted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=2063)|
| 0:34:28| So I wanted to read this resolution for all of you all. And whereas on Sunday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=2068)|
| 0:34:36| June 8th, 1919, an organizational meeting was held in the auditorium of Inskip| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=2076)|

| 0:34:49| following a brief charge and a prayer for God's blessings, Inskip Baptist| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=2089)|
| 0:34:54| Church was organized with 18 charter members, and whereas the following day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=2094)|
| 0:35:01| the church purchased two acres of land on what is now Rowan Road to serve as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=2101)|
| 0:35:07| the church site, and on October the 8th, 1920, construction began on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=2107)|

| 0:37:21| much this church has meant to that whole area of Inskip, and while I was a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=2241)|
| 0:37:28| student at Shannondale Elementary, there was Mrs. Sanders, and her| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=2248)|

| 0:39:41| exceptional and extraordinary service to our community. I do believe in finding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=2381)|

| 0:39:49| true volunteer spirit. Vance, if you and your family would come up and join me as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=2389)|
| 0:39:54| I read the proclamation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=2394)|
| 0:40:12| It's my honor to read the proclamation from Knox County, whereas since| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=2412)|
| 0:40:17| 1978, Jay Vance Link III, otherwise known to all of us as just Vance, has been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=2417)|
| 0:40:23| the face of youth baseball at Knoxville Youth Sports and is being honored for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=2423)|
| 0:40:27| his 40-plus years of volunteer service to the community. And whereas Vance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=2427)|
| 0:40:31| established his impact in youth sports growing up in Knoxville and serving as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=2431)|
| 0:40:36| one of the earliest commissioners of the Youth Sports League, known as Sequoia| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=2436)|
| 0:40:41| Baseball, later moving to Lakeshore Park and becoming Knoxville Youth Sports, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=2441)|
| 0:40:45| whereas Vance has devoted countless volunteer hours, taught life lessons, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=2445)|
| 0:40:50| has shared his love of baseball with six and seven-year-old players and their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=2450)|
| 0:40:54| families in Knoxville Youth Sports' Pee Wee League, otherwise now known only as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=2454)|
| 0:40:59| Vance Pitch. And whereas Vance has served and continues to serve as the league's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=2459)|
| 0:41:04| unofficial commissioner, coach, umpire, pitcher, and parent and crowd control| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=2464)|
| 0:41:10| expert. And whereas on average Vance pitches over 80 games per season over a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=2470)|
| 0:41:15| 10 to 12 week period each spring for an estimated total of 3,000 games and more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=2475)|
| 0:41:20| than 15,000 innings over four decades. And whereas Vance's selfless devotion to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=2480)|
| 0:41:26| youth baseball has enriched the lives of countless players and their families,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=2486)|
| 0:41:30| including in some cases multiple generations within the same family. I do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=2490)|
| 0:41:35| want to break for just a second in the proclamation in some of the research in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=2495)|
| 0:41:39| addition to those thousands of players noted, Vance has either coached or coached| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=2499)|
| 0:41:44| families of the notable people such as Rockies legend Todd Helton, Mayors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=2504)|
| 0:41:49| Victor Ashe and Randy Tyree, Governor Bill Haslam's family, Pat Summitt's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=2509)|
| 0:41:53| family, and Coach Phil Fulmer's family. And even as Coach Fulmer was a coach,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=2513)|
| 0:41:58| Vance kept him in line as well, I will say. Continuing on, whereas Vance's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=2518)|
| 0:42:04| devotion to Knoxville youth is matched by his talent and stellar instruction to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=2524)|
| 0:42:09| the children in a way that is encouraging and supportive. And whereas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=2529)|
| 0:42:13| players who graduate from Vance pitch leave with more confidence and a greater| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=2533)|
| 0:42:17| respect for the game and understanding of teamwork and a new friend. Now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=2537)|
| 0:42:21| therefore be it resolved by the Commission of Knox County as follows,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=2541)|
| 0:42:25| the Commission of Knox County hereby honors Vance Link upon the 40th| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=2545)|
| 0:42:29| anniversary of his volunteer service to Knoxville youth sports and expresses its| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=2549)|
| 0:42:34| sincere thanks and appreciation for his dedication to the youth in our community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=2554)|
| 0:42:38| and the many lives he has positively impacted over the years. Be it further| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=2558)|
| 0:42:42| resolved that a copy of this resolution be presented to Vance Link and that the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=2562)|
| 0:42:46| resolution is to take effect from and after its passage as provided by the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=2566)|
| 0:42:50| Charter of Knox County, Tennessee, the public welfare requiring it. And I'd love| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=2570)|
| 0:42:54| to invite Vance to say a few words and then I would love to invite his family,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=2574)|
| 0:43:00| Vance, and all of our uniformed players in support to come up for a quick| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=2580)|
| 0:43:04| picture. Congratulations, Vance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=2584)|
| 0:43:22| Thank you very much. Thanks, Larson, so much. I was listening to that thinking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=2602)|
| 0:43:29| who is this guy? But honestly, I know we would all much rather be at the ballpark| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=2609)|
| 0:43:35| than here, no offense to you folks, but thanks again to Larson and to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=2615)|
| 0:43:40| Commission for recognizing me for the work that I've done at the ball field.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=2620)|
| 0:43:46| It's funny, John Schmidt is a dear friend of mine and was on Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=2626)|
| 0:43:50| several years back and I said, now am I supposed to talk at all? And he said, well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=2630)|
| 0:43:55| yeah, but most of the time they give these awards posthumously, so be thankful| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=2635)|
| 0:44:02| but be brief. And I said, well I am thankful and I will be brief, but I first| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=2642)|
| 0:44:08| want to thank my family, Robbie and my son, JV, my daughter, Whitney, who's not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=2648)|
| 0:44:14| able to be here tonight, because if anybody got shortchanged on all the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=2654)|
| 0:44:20| years I've done this, it's been my own family and I've felt bad about that. I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=2660)|
| 0:44:26| also want to thank a couple or three other people, my mentor in baseball for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=2666)|
| 0:44:32| years and years. He coached me 60 years ago in Little League and helped with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=2672)|
| 0:44:36| Sequoia Youth Recreation, that's Lawrence House. Lawrence helped start Knox U| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=2676)|
| 0:44:43| Sports. He retired from coaching a few years back, but he's always managed to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=2683)|
| 0:44:48| stay on the sideline. I would also like to thank my dear friends at Knox U| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=2688)|
| 0:44:54| Sports who have allowed me to continue to do this. Chad Regal is the executive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=2694)|
| 0:44:59| director, but the one who has helped me by far and away the most through Knox U| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=2699)|
| 0:45:04| Sports is Ann Marie Conaty. Ann Marie is right over here, second from the end on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=2704)|
| 0:45:10| the right. She and I have worked together for 20 years now and she's been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=2710)|
| 0:45:17| wonderful to work with. It's a labor of love. You don't do the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=2717)|
| 0:45:23| things that we do for the recognition you get, because you love what you do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=2723)|
| 0:45:29| If awards and recognition come your way, so be it, but trust me, I'd way rather be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=2729)|
| 0:45:35| on the ball field with all these little people. I've met wonderful people over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=2735)|
| 0:45:39| the years doing what I do. Governor Haslam actually played for me years and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=2739)|
| 0:45:44| years ago. He was a fairly light-hitting shortstop, and I told Bill that one day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=2744)|
| 0:45:50| and he didn't appreciate it much at all, but the joy of it is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=2750)|
| 0:45:58| working with children. Any of you that are teachers or are involved in any way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=2758)|
| 0:46:05| with nonprofits or even for-profits, if you're working with kids, their minds are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=2765)|
| 0:46:10| like sponges, but at the same time they appreciate you, they love you, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=2770)|
| 0:46:16| they are my dear, dear friends. What we've done at Knox U Sports is we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=2776)|
| 0:46:21| teach them a little bit about baseball. We teach them about winning and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=2781)|
| 0:46:27| losing, but we also teach them that you win graciously and you lose gracefully,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=2787)|
| 0:46:34| and that baseball is just a game. It's a fun game. The more you play it, the better| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=2794)|
| 0:46:40| you get at it, but my joy and what I've told the kids forever and ever is that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=2800)|
| 0:46:46| they should be so blessed. They know they should be thankful for all the many| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=2806)|
| 0:46:51| blessings they have to be able to play the game and do the things that they do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=2811)|
| 0:46:55| in the free country that we live in, where a lot of little people aren't able| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=2815)|
| 0:47:00| to do that anywhere else in the world like we're able to do it. So I thank you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=2820)|
| 0:47:06| all again very much, and again, I give this recognition to all the people that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=2826)|
| 0:47:11| do the same kind of thing I do and for whatever reason have not gotten| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=2831)|
| 0:47:15| recognized as I have. Thank you again, Larson. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=2835)|
| 0:47:27| All the uniforms, come on up. All the players.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=2847)|
| 0:47:36| All the Yankees. Go Yankees!| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=2856)|
| 0:48:06| Thank you, Vance, for your service, and I can tell you, in the 4th District, the man is a legend, and any time you have a whole baseball league named after you while you're still active in it, you know, that's, honestly, that's a tremendous tribute. He's really impacted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=2886)|
| 0:48:33| Everybody knows when you say Vance Pitch, they know what you're talking about, and it's a pretty big deal, so thank you. While we're transitioning, I'd like to also recognize former County Commissioner, Big Shoes to Fill, John Schmid, who is here in the audience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=2913)|
| 0:48:51| Former Commissioner Schmid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=2931)|
| 0:48:58| Thank you for being here, Commissioner Schmid. Commissioner Schmid has also been very active in that same baseball league, so I'd also like to recognize, I believe, Mayor Glenn Jacobs is here. I know he was here earlier. I'm sure he's maybe seated outside of my purview to the left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=2938)|
| 0:49:15| On the bench, straight ahead. Okay. In the back. Okay. Sorry, Mayor. Yeah, sorry, Mayor. Mike Hammond is also joining us from Criminal Court Clerk. Mike, I think I saw you back over here, so Mike, thank you for joining us. My old school friend, Charlie Susano. There you are, Charlie. Thank you for joining us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=2955)|
| 0:49:34| Yes, you're younger, and I know Sister Paulina has often punished you. So, I also want to thank Nick McBride from Register of Deeds. Nick, you're here, so there you are, Nick. And Super Bob Thomas from our school board. So, thank you, Superintendent Thomas from Knox County Schools. Thank you for being here. Okay. Madam Clerk, next item on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=2974)|
| 0:49:58| This is consideration of approval and minutes of the previous meeting. So moved. Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=2998)|
| 0:50:29| Are there any, I will announce the deferrals, non-consent, and any formal adds. Is there any additions to the agenda for tonight? And then I'll kind of go over how we're going to discuss the stuff. Commissioner Anderson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=3029)|
| 0:50:44| I don't have an addition. I have a pull from consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=3044)|
| 0:50:47| Okay. What's the pull?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=3047)|
| 0:50:48| Thirty-nine. I think it's, I think we're going to probably have more discussion on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=3048)|
| 0:50:52| That was thirty-nine. Yeah, I had it on my list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=3052)|
| 0:50:54| Okay, I'd like to pull that from consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=3054)|
| 0:50:56| Okay. So, thirty-nine will be added to the pull from consent agenda. Is there any other changes? Commissioner Biggs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=3056)|
| 0:51:04| I want to withdraw number fifty-three from my discussion item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=3064)|
| 0:51:07| Okay. Fifty-three is an official withdrawal. Is there any additional changes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=3067)|
| 0:51:15| Okay. Earlier today, Commissioner Busler had asked me about adding a discussion item around the key learnings from the Tennessee County Commission Association meeting last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=3075)|
| 0:51:26| What I'd like to do is add that it just came in today. If we have time to get to that before we move into zoning, we'll do that tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=3086)|
| 0:51:35| Otherwise, we can move that forward to next month's meeting. So that's one additional change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=3095)|
| 0:51:42| Now, items that are being deferred, item number two, forty-nine and sixty-one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=3102)|
| 0:51:55| Official adds are item three, which we've already done, fifty, fifty-one, fifty-four, and fifty-five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=3115)|
| 0:52:04| And to review your non-consent items, item one, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, twenty-one, thirty-nine, fifty-two, fifty-three,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=3124)|
| 0:52:23| excuse me, that was pulled, fifty-four, and fifty-five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=3143)|
| 0:52:28| Okay. As far as proceeding down our agenda, I'm going to use Chairman's discretion to move two of the discussion items to the front of the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=3148)|
| 0:52:37| That's item fifty-five and item fifty-two. Item fifty-five was a general budget discussion and item fifty-two was a discussion more specific to the schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=3157)|
| 0:52:49| That way, if we go through those, that may help our school folks get out of here a little bit earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=3169)|
| 0:52:55| We will then move, after discussing those two items, move back into the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=3175)|
| 0:53:02| And that is how tonight is going to go. Yes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=3182)|
| 0:53:08| Krista Baig, 400 Main Street. We're asking to defer item number seven to next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=3188)|
| 0:53:18| Will be moved to next month. Madam Clerk, you got that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=3198)|
| 0:53:23| Are there any other changes? Motion to set the agenda. Okay. All right. We have a proper motion from Commissioner Anders with a second from Commissioner Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=3203)|
| 0:53:32| All in favor of setting the agenda, please say aye. Aye. All opposed, please say nay. Okay. The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=3212)|
| 0:53:38| Okay. Madam Clerk, first item. All right. I'd like to go ahead and just jump right into the discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=3218)|
| 0:53:48| Okay. The first item was a general budget discussion while we have our department heads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=3228)|
| 0:53:56| We originally had scheduled a meeting to visit on that tomorrow afternoon. However, we've decided to include that as part of tonight's meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=3236)|
| 0:54:03| So while we've got our department heads here tonight, are there any more specific questions pertaining to the budget?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=3243)|
| 0:54:10| I know there may be some about item thirty-nine, which we can get to on that when we get to it in our agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=3250)|
| 0:54:16| But any general budget discussion questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=3256)|
| 0:54:20| Yes. Thank you for approaching the podium, Mr. Caldwell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=3260)|
| 0:54:28| Okay. Commissioner Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=3268)|
| 0:54:32| Thank you, Mr. Chair. Right at the end of our last discussion in the schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=3272)|
| 0:54:40| Superintendent Bob Thomas mentioned about the number of schools that we have in the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=3280)|
| 0:54:46| And I just want to ask one thing for him if he could come to the floor, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=3286)|
| 0:55:07| We didn't discuss a lot about this because we got hung out on some other things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=3307)|
| 0:55:12| But you did make a mention about that we had too many schools in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=3312)|
| 0:55:17| And that had to do with buildings and it had to do, I guess, with efficiencies that the schools have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=3317)|
| 0:55:25| And while I was at the TCCA meeting, I talked with other school systems that have consolidated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=3325)|
| 0:55:32| or getting into the situation of making schools bigger and being more efficient.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=3332)|
| 0:55:37| Can you explain to me a little bit more about why you made that statement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=3337)|
| 0:55:42| Well, it had to do with what we were talking about at the time in terms of looking at other school districts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=3342)|
| 0:55:48| how we spend our money versus how other school districts spend their money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=3348)|
| 0:55:52| And when we looked at some of the larger school districts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=3352)|
| 0:55:57| they basically had fewer schools and more students in those fewer schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=3357)|
| 0:56:02| So that's the context in which I made that statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=3362)|
| 0:56:06| Again, nothing wrong with small schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=3366)|
| 0:56:08| It's just in terms of cost, it's going to be more costly per student.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=3368)|
| 0:56:13| And I guess what you're talking about is being more efficient, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=3373)|
| 0:56:17| That's correct, yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=3377)|
| 0:56:18| Well, I've talked to a number of other schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=3378)|
| 0:56:20| I talked to Sullivan County when we were at the TCCA meeting to just give you an example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=3380)|
| 0:56:25| A few years back they had nine high schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=3385)|
| 0:56:28| Today they have two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=3388)|
| 0:56:30| And Williamson County is going to a grammar school type, K-8, instead of middle schools and things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=3390)|
| 0:56:38| Do you see that in the future?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=3398)|
| 0:56:41| Are you all planning for anything like that in the future, reorganizing the schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=3401)|
| 0:56:47| maybe having a CTE high school instead of just a CTE program?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=3407)|
| 0:56:53| How in the future can we make the school system more efficient instead of just spending more money on it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=3413)|
| 0:57:00| Well, the board has not had any kind of conversations in terms of closing schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=3420)|
| 0:57:06| or actually building schools and consolidating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=3426)|
| 0:57:11| But what I'm asking is you made the statement saying we had too many schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=3431)|
| 0:57:17| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=3437)|
| 0:57:18| And I said in the context, please put it in the context in terms of efficiencies of dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=3438)|
| 0:57:24| Yes, and you talked about comparing to other school districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=3444)|
| 0:57:29| And there's got to be something there that you said we probably need to maybe plan for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=3449)|
| 0:57:36| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=3456)|
| 0:57:37| I'm not an educator in efficiency in the schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=3457)|
| 0:57:40| But that did intrigue me a little bit that you would say that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=3460)|
| 0:57:44| And if it is going to be more efficient schools, how do we get to that point to make them more efficient?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=3464)|
| 0:57:50| Is it the number of students in the schools?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=3470)|
| 0:57:53| Is there a certain number that we should be at?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=3473)|
| 0:57:56| How can you come back to this commission when we plan for the future and you're asking for more money?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=3476)|
| 0:58:02| How can we plan to say this is where we're going?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=3482)|
| 0:58:06| This is the direction we're going because of the efficiency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=3486)|
| 0:58:11| I think I said, too, that when you merge two school districts, the schools are not always in the right place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=3491)|
| 0:58:17| But there has not been, since about 1990, there's not been much discussion or talk or will, from my standpoint,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=3497)|
| 0:58:27| in terms of closing small schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=3507)|
| 0:58:29| But if you have a small elementary school of 150, 170, 200 students,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=3509)|
| 0:58:34| it's going to cost more than an elementary school with 600, 700, or 800 students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=3514)|
| 0:58:39| just because of more teaching personnel, administration, custodial, food service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=3519)|
| 0:58:44| I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=3524)|
| 0:58:46| What I'm getting at is we as a commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=3526)|
| 0:58:50| Let's try to keep it specific to the budget, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=3530)|
| 0:58:52| I get your point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=3532)|
| 0:58:53| I'm trying to get to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=3533)|
| 0:58:54| I get your point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=3534)|
| 0:58:56| But I also ask him, what can we do to help you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=3536)|
| 0:58:59| And we're spending additional money to add more schools on this budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=3539)|
| 0:59:06| Will you bring us a plan if we're going to go that direction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=3546)|
| 0:59:11| which you mentioned about maybe making schools more efficient?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=3551)|
| 0:59:15| Well, right now there's not a plan in terms of the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=3555)|
| 0:59:19| We've got three new schools on the capital plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=3559)|
| 0:59:22| If the commission approves it, Adrian Burnett's basically a replacement school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=3562)|
| 0:59:27| Lonsdale's basically a replacement school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=3567)|
| 0:59:30| The new Northwest Elementary will be one that possibly some rezoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=3570)|
| 0:59:35| obviously to try to take some of the pressure off of the Hardin Valley Elementary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=3575)|
| 0:59:42| But there's no plans right now to build anything else to close any schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=3582)|
| 0:59:47| I'm not asking you to close.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=3587)|
| 0:59:48| I'm just asking you how can we be more efficient with our tax dollars?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=3588)|
| 0:59:54| Well, I really don't know how to say it in any other way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=3594)|
| 0:59:58| but if they have a larger school with more students in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=3598)|
| 1:00:01| the cost per student is lower because it is more efficient.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=3601)|
| 1:00:04| I don't know how else to say that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=3604)|
| 1:00:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=3606)|
| 1:00:07| In saying that, how do we get to that point?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=3607)|
| 1:00:10| Well, there would have to be a willingness to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=3610)|
| 1:00:12| Could you bring us a plan maybe or something that you would suggest to us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=3612)|
| 1:00:16| I'll be glad to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=3616)|
| 1:00:17| Mr. Busler, I appreciate we do want to see efficiency,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=3617)|
| 1:00:20| but let's try to keep it to the specific budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=3620)|
| 1:00:23| And I appreciate you bringing up this efficiency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=3623)|
| 1:00:25| We're discussing we're going to build a whole new school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=3625)|
| 1:00:30| and he's saying we've got more schools and buildings than we really need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=3630)|
| 1:00:35| And I'm just trying to get my hand around this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=3635)|
| 1:00:37| How are we going to protect the taxpayers' dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=3637)|
| 1:00:40| when we know that it could be more efficient in other ways?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=3640)|
| 1:00:43| And I'm just asking, will the next budgetary system give us a plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=3643)|
| 1:00:48| where we can advance for the next 10 to 15 years to get to that plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=3648)|
| 1:00:52| where we're more efficient like other school districts are getting there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=3652)|
| 1:00:55| So if we're just going to do a budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=3655)|
| 1:01:01| and he's saying we've got too many buildings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=3661)|
| 1:01:03| then why are we building another new building?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=3663)|
| 1:01:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=3666)|
| 1:01:07| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=3667)|
| 1:01:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=3668)|
| 1:01:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=3669)|
| 1:01:10| Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=3670)|
| 1:01:11| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=3671)|
| 1:01:12| I'm good, Mr. Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=3672)|
| 1:01:14| Chris, in regard to debt service plan use of fund balance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=3674)|
| 1:01:19| how much money are we totaling?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=3679)|
| 1:01:21| Is this $8.6 million in planned use of fund balance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=3681)|
| 1:01:24| I'm good, Mr. Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=3684)|
| 1:01:25| I'm asking Chris.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=3685)|
| 1:01:26| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=3686)|
| 1:01:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=3687)|
| 1:01:30| On page 38, Chris.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=3690)|
| 1:01:39| So that would be all funds and its planned use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=3699)|
| 1:01:43| And so the big number of that, of course, is $6.2 million in debt service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=3703)|
| 1:01:48| That is shown there because we budget our variable rate debt at 4.5 or 5%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=3708)|
| 1:01:53| We know currently we're paying less than 3, probably less than 2.5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=3713)|
| 1:01:57| So we don't anticipate spending that 6.2 on debt service,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=3717)|
| 1:02:02| but we show it because we will always budget from a conservative standpoint| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=3722)|
| 1:02:06| as it relates to interest rate there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=3726)|
| 1:02:09| And similar things on the other funds, although the other big one is the general fund,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=3729)|
| 1:02:15| and we always budget for 100% of expenditures knowing historically we spend 97%, not 98%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=3735)|
| 1:02:24| So we don't anticipate using that 1.7.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=3744)|
| 1:02:27| We feel that's the worst case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=3747)|
| 1:02:29| Let's go back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=3749)|
| 1:02:30| I know 19 is not finished out yet, so let's go back to 18.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=3750)|
| 1:02:32| Of the 6.7 million, how much did we spend out of that planned fund balance use?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=3752)|
| 1:02:38| Do you remember?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=3758)|
| 1:02:43| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=3763)|
| 1:02:46| My recollection is we didn't spend any of it, and we added back to the fund balance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=3766)|
| 1:02:52| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=3772)|
| 1:02:53| I don't remember the exact amount we added back, but we did add back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=3773)|
| 1:02:55| And that's kind of my point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=3775)|
| 1:02:57| So on 19, are we trending the same way in 19, not spending any and adding to the fund balance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=3777)|
| 1:03:03| I think for sure in the general fund we will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=3783)|
| 1:03:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=3786)|
| 1:03:07| Debt service, that 7.4 is a little high.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=3787)|
| 1:03:10| I think we'll break even on debt service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=3790)|
| 1:03:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=3794)|
| 1:03:15| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=3795)|
| 1:03:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=3796)|
| 1:03:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=3797)|
| 1:03:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=3798)|
| 1:03:19| Commissioner Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=3799)|
| 1:03:20| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=3800)|
| 1:03:21| This question has to do with if we know what the BEP allocations are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=3801)|
| 1:03:27| I know we've got one April estimate, and if those have changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=3807)|
| 1:03:37| We do not officially have a May estimate at this point, but we did talk with the person that financed there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=3817)|
| 1:03:43| So I think the latest number we had was about $100,000 more than what we had in the April estimate, but we don't have that yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=3823)|
| 1:03:50| So there should be a little bit more in terms of the funding coming to Knox County in the amount of about $100,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=3830)|
| 1:03:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=3836)|
| 1:03:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=3837)|
| 1:03:58| And my other question was, and I maybe not have phrased this correctly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=3838)|
| 1:04:03| I know the insurance for school personnel, especially our teachers, are negotiated under PECA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=3843)|
| 1:04:10| Do we foresee an increase in those insurance premiums this year that will impact the pay increases we have actually dedicated?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=3850)|
| 1:04:20| No, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=3860)|
| 1:04:21| We are not anticipating an insurance increase this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=3861)|
| 1:04:24| So the premiums will remain constant for this coming year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=3864)|
| 1:04:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=3869)|
| 1:04:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=3871)|
| 1:04:32| Thank you, Commissioner Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=3872)|
| 1:04:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=3873)|
| 1:04:34| Are there any other budget questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=3874)|
| 1:04:38| I guess one follow-up I may have off of Commissioner Gill and then one follow-up I have after Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=3878)|
| 1:04:45| Superintendent Thomas, he had mentioned that there was a, and this is, I know you're very clear that it was not official,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=3885)|
| 1:04:51| that it was maybe $100,000 more based on our unofficial BEP estimate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=3891)|
| 1:04:56| If that were to be kind of a harbinger of the next BEP forecast,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=3896)|
| 1:05:00| if you all can remember what it was last year at about this time, I guess we got a little extra money in May,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=3900)|
| 1:05:05| and then that also translated to a little bit of extra money when we got our final forecast.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=3905)|
| 1:05:09| What was the jump last year between our May estimate and the next forecast?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=3909)|
| 1:05:16| And if you don't remember, I'll forgive you, but I know it went up a little bit too the second time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=3916)|
| 1:05:20| It did go up a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=3920)|
| 1:05:21| I'm sorry, I don't remember the exact amount, but we can get that information for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=3921)|
| 1:05:25| I think that, yeah, email it out to the Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=3925)|
| 1:05:28| And I remember it went up a little, but I couldn't remember because I would, fingers crossed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=3928)|
| 1:05:32| I would hope that it would go up a little bit again as they tighten up those numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=3932)|
| 1:05:35| Yes, I think actually a couple of the estimates did go up from the April.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=3935)|
| 1:05:39| All right, and then, so Chris, all right, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=3939)|
| 1:05:43| Thank you, Superintendent Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=3943)|
| 1:05:44| Chris, you had had a quick question, our follow-up to Commissioner Anders, that our general fund balance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=3944)|
| 1:05:49| there is a chance it could go up a little bit based on our forecast last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=3949)|
| 1:05:53| Could you clarify that a little bit more?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=3953)|
| 1:05:57| Yes, so as far as FY19 is concerned, we were scheduled to use about $1.6 million of planned use of fund balance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=3957)|
| 1:06:08| So as we always say, that's worst case scenario.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=3968)|
| 1:06:10| So currently, as far as the general fund goes, we plan to probably spend about 98% of expenses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=3970)|
| 1:06:19| On the revenue side, sales tax is really good right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=3979)|
| 1:06:24| The piece of sales tax the general fund gets is fairly small, but we're going to beat budget on local auction sales tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=3984)|
| 1:06:31| We're going to also do better than what we budgeted for as it relates to current property taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=3991)|
| 1:06:39| The big number for us will be what does hollow income tax do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=3999)|
| 1:06:45| And so we get that number in July.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=4005)|
| 1:06:48| And so that will tend to lead us to see where budget surplus will end up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=4008)|
| 1:06:55| With that being said, we have already started to gather a list of requests for budget surplus, and so we get those quite often.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=4015)|
| 1:07:06| And so that list currently is probably $4 million or $5 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=4026)|
| 1:07:12| And so as we look towards the end of fiscal of 19 and we see what amount of budget surplus we have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=4032)|
| 1:07:21| we already have those requests that are there, and we start to look for things that make sense to allocate those for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=4041)|
| 1:07:30| Allocate out of one-time dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=4050)|
| 1:07:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=4052)|
| 1:07:33| One-time dollars for one-time expenses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=4053)|
| 1:07:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=4055)|
| 1:07:36| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=4056)|
| 1:07:37| Thank you for that clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=4057)|
| 1:07:39| Commissioner, Carson, was that yours?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=4059)|
| 1:07:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=4061)|
| 1:07:42| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=4062)|
| 1:07:43| Thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=4063)|
| 1:07:44| You reminded me of something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=4064)|
| 1:07:45| I guess it's a question for Superintendent Thomas and Chris.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=4065)|
| 1:07:48| Give us an update on early retirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=4068)|
| 1:07:50| Is the deadline already passed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=4070)|
| 1:07:52| I mean, just particulars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=4072)|
| 1:07:54| Just give us an update.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=4074)|
| 1:07:56| Chris can do the same thing on the county side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=4076)|
| 1:07:59| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=4079)|
| 1:08:01| Oh, gosh, months ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=4081)|
| 1:08:02| So I think we had, what, 221, 222, somewhere in that neighborhood, folks to take the incentive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=4082)|
| 1:08:13| And so we saved, I think, was it about a million and a half?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=4093)|
| 1:08:18| I guess in terms of the incentive that was offered, we were able to save about a million and a half dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=4098)|
| 1:08:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=4105)|
| 1:08:27| Commissioner Anderson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=4107)|
| 1:08:28| Mr. Thomas, historically looking back, of course, I came on in 2008,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=4108)|
| 1:08:37| and at that time the school board and the school system in the county had worked together to do a lot of large projects,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=4117)|
| 1:08:43| you know, Hardin Valley, Powell Middle, put a lot of debt, and a lot of that debt's in operations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=4123)|
| 1:08:50| So as we build these three new schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=4130)|
| 1:08:52| we have been talking over the last ten years about getting that debt service out of your operations costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=4132)|
| 1:08:58| And we're spending about $14 or so million a year in debt service costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=4138)|
| 1:09:04| And the goal was that when that debt rolled off was to put that back into the classroom,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=4144)|
| 1:09:09| to keep hiring more teachers or raising the pay of teachers and also more assistance for literacy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=4149)|
| 1:09:17| And those were all the plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=4157)|
| 1:09:19| And so by adding these three schools, which I support all three of these schools going back into the plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=4159)|
| 1:09:24| we're kind of going against the historical desire of what we had set forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=4164)|
| 1:09:28| Is that a correct statement as far as policy-wise and the old plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=4168)|
| 1:09:33| Yes, sir, it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=4173)|
| 1:09:35| And I think we're, in the next few years, going to see a little bit more debt roll off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=4175)|
| 1:09:39| So even with these three new schools coming online,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=4179)|
| 1:09:43| I think we're still going to be able to see some of the debt come out of the general purpose budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=4183)|
| 1:09:50| One thing in our general purpose budget we probably need to do, though, too, in terms of maintenance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=4190)|
| 1:09:54| there are some items that we fund through capital that probably ought to be in the general purpose budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=4194)|
| 1:10:00| So over the next few years, we'll be looking at maybe a couple of two or three million dollars that really,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=4200)|
| 1:10:06| that's been funded through debt that needs to be funded through our operations budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=4206)|
| 1:10:11| So I think we're still going to see some funds available through the retirement of debt that will remain in general purpose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=4211)|
| 1:10:19| Yes, but I think really my statement is that building these three schools is continuing to take money out of the classroom| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=4219)|
| 1:10:25| that we had planned to put back in the classroom over historical time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=4225)|
| 1:10:29| That's what our desire was as a commission and as a school board over the last ten years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=4229)|
| 1:10:34| was to kind of get some of that debt rolled off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=4234)|
| 1:10:36| And I think it's just when you think about that as we move forward, as we continue to have school needs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=4236)|
| 1:10:41| whether we consolidate or upgrade some of the inner city schools and the old city schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=4241)|
| 1:10:47| they're going to have to be dealt with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=4247)|
| 1:10:49| I mean, the next six to ten years, they're all going to have to be dealt with because some of them are 80 and 100 years old.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=4249)|
| 1:10:54| And so when you think about that as we move forward, we're taking, every time we build a building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=4254)|
| 1:10:58| we're taking potential money out of the classroom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=4258)|
| 1:11:00| And I think it's important to keep that in the back of our mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=4260)|
| 1:11:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=4265)|
| 1:11:06| Any other commissioners?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=4266)|
| 1:11:07| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=4267)|
| 1:11:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=4268)|
| 1:11:09| Commissioner Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=4269)|
| 1:11:10| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=4270)|
| 1:11:11| I think to echo what Commissioner Andrews addressed about some of your inner city schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=4271)|
| 1:11:16| especially the capital needs that are going to have to occur,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=4276)|
| 1:11:19| we're going to have to take a look at all of those inner city schools and not just one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=4279)|
| 1:11:28| The capital needs for the schools in the first district needs a total look at,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=4288)|
| 1:11:36| in terms of their capital improvement, not just building one school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=4296)|
| 1:11:40| because the vast majority of those schools in the first district are older than 50 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=4300)|
| 1:11:47| So the capital plan must look at all of those from top to bottom and not just in a maintenance effort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=4307)|
| 1:11:55| Thank you, Commissioner Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=4315)|
| 1:11:57| Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=4317)|
| 1:11:59| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=4319)|
| 1:12:00| My question is for, I guess, Chris Caldwell,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=4320)|
| 1:12:03| or I see we do have our partners here with us from Helen Ross McNabb.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=4323)|
| 1:12:07| Can you help just explain, we talked about briefly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=4327)|
| 1:12:11| we are increasing our funding to the Behavioral Health Urgent Care Center fairly dramatically this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=4331)|
| 1:12:18| I think it is a very worthy investment of our public dollars,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=4338)|
| 1:12:22| and I just wanted to make sure we talked about why that has jumped so much and what we expect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=4342)|
| 1:12:27| I know we're still analyzing year one and looking at options for year two, three and beyond,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=4347)|
| 1:12:34| but what do we expect that to look like from a partnership down the road when it comes to our city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=4354)|
| 1:12:40| our county resources, our state resources?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=4360)|
| 1:12:43| Jerry or Chris, which one of you two want to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=4363)|
| 1:12:46| He's better than me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=4366)|
| 1:12:47| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=4367)|
| 1:12:49| Jerry Vagner, 201 West Springdale Avenue, Knoxville, Tennessee, with the Helen Ross McNabb Center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=4369)|
| 1:12:54| and thank you, Commissioner, for bringing that question to the forefront.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=4374)|
| 1:12:58| Essentially what happened was the state of Tennessee was a financial partner in this project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=4378)|
| 1:13:05| a 75% match for the operations and the infrastructure of the project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=4385)|
| 1:13:09| but their funding has ceased with the new administration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=4389)|
| 1:13:12| They chose not to continue to fund projects like this other than their startup costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=4392)|
| 1:13:17| So that kind of pressed us to look to the local community to right-size our project to the needs of the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=4397)|
| 1:13:25| And so the city and the county's partnership is vital for that to be a continuation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=4405)|
| 1:13:31| The other issue that happened in our community, whether or not the public at large is well aware of this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=4411)|
| 1:13:37| the judicial process has changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=4417)|
| 1:13:39| And so a number of the low-level nonviolent misdemeanor charges that folks were being arrested for in our community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=4419)|
| 1:13:47| who had mental health or substance abuse issues are now being cited for those types of crimes as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=4427)|
| 1:13:54| So those things together led us to a solution that required some additional funding in order to meet that need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=4434)|
| 1:14:02| but also diversified what we did more than just housing people at that facility 24-7 for a 72-hour length of stay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=4442)|
| 1:14:10| We'll be doing more community outreach and follow-up as they move back to the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=4450)|
| 1:14:15| to ensure that they're good citizens in the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=4455)|
| 1:14:19| Thank you for that update.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=4459)|
| 1:14:22| A couple of questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=4462)|
| 1:14:23| So there was no multi-year agreement with the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=4463)|
| 1:14:26| It was just getting it open through the first year, capital and first-year ops?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=4466)|
| 1:14:31| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=4471)|
| 1:14:32| It was termed in the state budget infrastructure funding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=4472)|
| 1:14:36| so it was for the rehabilitation of the facility and the first 15 months of operation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=4476)|
| 1:14:41| There was a belief that the will of the state government was to continue to be a partner in those initiatives,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=4481)|
| 1:14:49| but as administrations change, that never materialized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=4489)|
| 1:14:54| Is that statewide or just for our facility?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=4494)|
| 1:14:56| It is statewide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=4496)|
| 1:14:57| There were seven initial projects in the state of Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=4497)|
| 1:15:00| and none of those projects received ongoing operational funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=4500)|
| 1:15:04| And when you talk about the diversification of services, upon my last tour there I was incredibly impressed by that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=4504)|
| 1:15:13| I think it's called the CIT unit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=4513)|
| 1:15:15| In the midst of the addiction recovery, the substance abuse, and the mental health side,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=4515)|
| 1:15:22| there is essentially a 4011 for mental health services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=4522)|
| 1:15:26| Could you just talk about that, and is that going to be sort of beefed up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=4526)|
| 1:15:29| because it was a little bit of a pilot program for the first year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=4529)|
| 1:15:33| I appreciate that comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=4533)|
| 1:15:34| We do mobile crisis in this community, so we take phone calls from anybody who's in a psychiatric crisis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=4534)|
| 1:15:40| We man that 24-7, 365.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=4540)|
| 1:15:43| So we're telephonically being able to interface with people, and we're going to continue to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=4543)|
| 1:15:47| And we're actually asking the state of Tennessee to enhance the crisis funding for that piece| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=4547)|
| 1:15:52| because it is underfunded at this point across the state but in our community in particular.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=4552)|
| 1:15:57| And then the other part, the CIT, is where we go out and train officers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=4557)|
| 1:16:01| in how to deal with people who have mental health conditions so that they respond appropriately| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=4561)|
| 1:16:05| and don't overreact or underreact in a situation and get them the help they need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=4565)|
| 1:16:10| And having a place like the Urgent Care Center to bring people who are in dire need of treatment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=4570)|
| 1:16:15| gives our law enforcement an additional option in their tool belt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=4575)|
| 1:16:19| Thank you very much for that update.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=4579)|
| 1:16:20| Thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=4580)|
| 1:16:21| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=4581)|
| 1:16:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=4582)|
| 1:16:23| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=4583)|
| 1:16:24| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=4584)|
| 1:16:25| Jerry, the Crisis Stabilization Unit is nothing new.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=4585)|
| 1:16:29| That was in the other facility, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=4589)|
| 1:16:31| The beds were just moved down there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=4591)|
| 1:16:33| Crisis Stabilization, yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=4593)|
| 1:16:35| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=4595)|
| 1:16:36| So we have a plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=4596)|
| 1:16:38| We put together a 10-year project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=4598)|
| 1:16:41| And within one year of operation, the states have pulled their fund| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=4601)|
| 1:16:44| and changed the laws on who can be cited to this place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=4604)|
| 1:16:49| How much money, state and local, was used to build that building, remodel that building?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=4609)|
| 1:16:55| The building's remodel was, I believe, $2 million, almost $2 million to rehab that facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=4615)|
| 1:17:03| The state paid for 75 percent of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=4623)|
| 1:17:06| So I don't have my math calculator in front of me, but the lion's share of that facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=4626)|
| 1:17:10| And how many patients were treated at that facility only on the behavioral health care side?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=4630)|
| 1:17:17| So approximately 500 people were assessed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=4637)|
| 1:17:21| and treated on the behavioral health urgent care side of the facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=4641)|
| 1:17:25| And what number do you project to treat on that side this coming year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=4645)|
| 1:17:30| We are going to shorten the length of stay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=4650)|
| 1:17:32| but the average census should be about 400 or 500 that we would service in that project over the course of the year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=4652)|
| 1:17:38| We're going to go from a 72-hour treatment program to a 24-hour treatment program, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=4658)|
| 1:17:45| Yes, we would expect the length of stay to be about 24 hours,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=4665)|
| 1:17:48| but in that facility we'll have the ability to seat people for a longer length of stay on an individual basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=4668)|
| 1:17:55| We're not going to require people to go out if they're not ready to go out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=4675)|
| 1:17:58| And what you mean by community outreach is you will be traveling from there to the detention facility to work with inmates?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=4678)|
| 1:18:06| We will, but we will also follow them into the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=4686)|
| 1:18:09| When somebody is released from our detention facility into the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=4689)|
| 1:18:14| right now they really have very little follow-up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=4694)|
| 1:18:17| We are going to intensely follow them into the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=4697)|
| 1:18:19| and provide treatment and case management, if you will, as a follow-along option for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=4699)|
| 1:18:25| Chris had provided us with some data that you provided us with, I guess, earlier this week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=4705)|
| 1:18:30| In it, 67% of the people who were treated attended their first meeting afterwards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=4710)|
| 1:18:37| Did you have any information on the percentage of people that went to their second meeting afterwards receiving treatment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=4717)|
| 1:18:44| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=4724)|
| 1:18:45| As part of this project, we very specifically targeted the first appointment as a point of connection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=4725)|
| 1:18:51| We didn't have enough resources to track them beyond the six-month mark, which was what the time frame was for the outcomes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=4731)|
| 1:18:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=4738)|
| 1:18:59| Do you know what percentage of your clients that you treated received permanent housing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=4739)|
| 1:19:06| I don't know the answer to that off the top of my head.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=4746)|
| 1:19:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=4750)|
| 1:19:11| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=4751)|
| 1:19:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=4753)|
| 1:19:14| Commissioner Gill?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=4754)|
| 1:19:15| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=4755)|
| 1:19:16| Commissioner Smith was asking some of the questions, but here's what I'm needing some understanding of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=4756)|
| 1:19:25| So the number of people we're going to serve, where is the data from a year, the data from a year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=4765)|
| 1:19:34| So if I'm in the facility, that is considered a point of contact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=4774)|
| 1:19:39| What occurs for the people that have been served for an entire year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=4779)|
| 1:19:44| Do we have any data or information about our point of services for them, housing, case management, treatment, support?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=4784)|
| 1:19:54| Where are we on the people we have already served?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=4794)|
| 1:19:57| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=4797)|
| 1:19:58| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=4798)|
| 1:19:59| So for anybody who came to the Urgent Care Center, we always provide an assessment of those people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=4799)|
| 1:20:04| and then we provide up to a 72-hour length of stay in that facility this past year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=4804)|
| 1:20:08| And then we followed them into the community to make sure that they followed up on their treatment recommendations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=4808)|
| 1:20:13| and got to the appointments, some of which involved getting them transportation, being their advocate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=4813)|
| 1:20:19| getting them benefits so that they could continue in the treatment process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=4819)|
| 1:20:22| And then a number of those we were trying to find permanent supportive housing for them as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=4822)|
| 1:20:26| about 60% of whom were homeless at the point in time that we met them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=4826)|
| 1:20:30| So beyond that, we don't have enough staff resources to track them as far as where they went for the course of the year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=4830)|
| 1:20:37| What we do know for those patients who came to us at the Helen Ross McNabb Center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=4837)|
| 1:20:42| we know where they're at in the system and how much we've continued to have them engaged.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=4842)|
| 1:20:47| But I would want this commission to know we refer to a lot of agencies, not just Helen Ross McNabb.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=4847)|
| 1:20:52| From design, we wanted to involve other entities, other mental health centers, other housing providers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=4852)|
| 1:20:57| So we kind of lose connectivity about where they were in the total course of the year in that regard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=4857)|
| 1:21:04| So does this change the original contract we signed with the center opening?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=4864)|
| 1:21:13| Does that change that contract?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=4873)|
| 1:21:15| The scope of the contract probably needs to be modified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=4875)|
| 1:21:18| I have a meeting with Knox County Purchasing on Thursday to review that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=4878)|
| 1:21:22| They would have to make that determination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=4882)|
| 1:21:24| But we are essentially changing some of the service levels in that contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=4884)|
| 1:21:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=4889)|
| 1:21:31| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=4891)|
| 1:21:32| Thank you, Commissioner Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=4892)|
| 1:21:33| Are there any, yes, Commissioner Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=4893)|
| 1:21:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=4897)|
| 1:21:38| This is for Chris.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=4898)|
| 1:21:40| We talked about this in your office the other day about court litigation taxes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=4900)|
| 1:21:45| and how it was originally set up for that taxes to be dispersed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=4905)|
| 1:21:49| And that's almost $2 million a year that comes out of that litigation tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=4909)|
| 1:21:54| I see here the governmental library fund, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=4914)|
| 1:21:58| we have about $60,000 of that that was used for that governmental fund, which is okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=4918)|
| 1:22:05| But the litigation tax, I think, the way it was originally set up was for court| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=4925)|
| 1:22:10| or upgrades here in the county building here and some other things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=4930)|
| 1:22:17| But we have $25 of that litigation tax, which is half of what we originally set up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=4937)|
| 1:22:23| going to another entity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=4943)|
| 1:22:25| And I said it didn't look like that litigation was the way it was passed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=4945)|
| 1:22:30| that we were using it properly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=4950)|
| 1:22:33| Even though we made a resolution to use $25 of that to pay off debt in the schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=4953)|
| 1:22:40| but it was originally set up for us to have inside the court building here and the sheriff's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=4960)|
| 1:22:48| Is there anything in the future that we will be redirecting that like the resolution said it should be used for?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=4968)|
| 1:22:56| The ordinance is very clear in how it reads,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=4976)|
| 1:22:59| and it says that $25 is to go to pay down school debt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=4979)|
| 1:23:03| If the commission wishes to change that, you all can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=4983)|
| 1:23:07| Until then, I have to administer that as it sits and how it reads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=4987)|
| 1:23:16| And it reads $25 to school security, $25 to pay down school debt,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=4996)|
| 1:23:24| and the other $25 goes to courtroom security,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=5004)|
| 1:23:28| which we use to pay for sheriff's officers and BBA officers to work around the courtroom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=5008)|
| 1:23:37| I know that's what this commission did at one time when they passed a resolution to do $25 there and $25.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=5017)|
| 1:23:43| But the way it was originally set up is what I ask you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=5023)|
| 1:23:47| the way the resolution read from the state to add that on there was to be for upgrades in the courthouse and other things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=5027)|
| 1:23:55| and it was passed around that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=5035)|
| 1:23:57| And I was kind of worried that one of these days somebody's going to come back and say that's not what the tax was really given to us to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=5037)|
| 1:24:04| except that this body said we're going to use half of it to pay down school debt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=5044)|
| 1:24:11| And it had to do, I guess, with the courthouse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=5051)|
| 1:24:15| That's why they were collecting it here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=5055)|
| 1:24:17| And I had problems with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=5057)|
| 1:24:19| I'll have to probably go to the law director and have him look at the way it was originally set up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=5059)|
| 1:24:24| but I was worried about the way it was written by the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=5064)|
| 1:24:29| We have to go by the ordinance, and we have never had an audit finding related to how we appropriate those funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=5069)|
| 1:24:36| And if we were doing them incorrectly, I think we would have heard about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=5076)|
| 1:24:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=5081)|
| 1:24:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=5082)|
| 1:24:43| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=5083)|
| 1:24:44| Thank you, Commissioner Bessler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=5084)|
| 1:24:45| Any additional budget-related questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=5085)|
| 1:24:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=5094)|
| 1:24:55| Is there, once again, going, going, gone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=5095)|
| 1:25:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=5100)|
| 1:25:01| That will conclude this part, this agenda item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=5101)|
| 1:25:04| Next agenda item, Madam Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=5104)|
| 1:25:06| This is item number 52, discussion item regarding the school security process for allowing individuals into the schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=5106)|
| 1:25:15| Commissioner Carringer, you brought this item to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=5115)|
| 1:25:17| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=5117)|
| 1:25:20| Yes, the reason that I placed this on discussion is because of an incident that occurred in my district at Shenandoah Elementary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=5120)|
| 1:25:32| And it was all over Facebook.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=5132)|
| 1:25:34| It was all over Nextdoor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=5134)|
| 1:25:37| And I saw it, and it really got really bad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=5137)|
| 1:25:43| My mother said, did you see that on Nextdoor and Facebook about Shenandoah?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=5143)|
| 1:25:48| And I said, yes, I did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=5148)|
| 1:25:50| Well, about a week and a half went by, and then I started being stopped out in the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=5150)|
| 1:25:56| I started getting e-mails, and I started getting phone calls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=5156)|
| 1:26:01| There was a new principal placed at Shenandoah Elementary this past year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=5161)|
| 1:26:07| And the incident that occurred that some of you all may not know, but it is my duty and my responsibility of being elected by the people in District 2| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=5167)|
| 1:26:18| to express and ask about these concerns of security that happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=5178)|
| 1:26:26| There was a shooting down behind Smithwood, down behind the old lace cleaners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=5186)|
| 1:26:31| Anybody born and raised knows where that is, right at the intersection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=5191)|
| 1:26:36| There was a shooting on a Saturday evening, and there was a man who shot into another vehicle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=5196)|
| 1:26:47| The man that did the shooting had children at Shenandoah and Central and maybe Gresham.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=5207)|
| 1:26:55| The car that he shot into also had the children, the mother of the students were in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=5215)|
| 1:27:06| So this man was arrested, and he posted bond and was out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=5226)|
| 1:27:12| And what I have been told and what has been seen and all was that the man who did the shooting that was out on bond| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=5232)|
| 1:27:22| was allowed to go into Shenandoah Elementary the following week to pick up his daughter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=5242)|
| 1:27:34| where also the children that were in the other car that got shot in were there also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=5254)|
| 1:27:42| So it was a big concern, a big talk all around the Fountain City area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=5262)|
| 1:27:52| which brought up a good thing, a good point to a sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=5272)|
| 1:27:59| Not only was he allowed in there once, but he was allowed twice the following week into the school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=5279)|
| 1:28:05| So I think all of us up here on commission and in the community and all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=5285)|
| 1:28:12| we cannot stress enough how concerned all of us are about our schools being safe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=5292)|
| 1:28:20| I mean, you know, we've had to put up fences and intercoms and all that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=5300)|
| 1:28:26| and it's really sad that our world has come to that, but it has.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=5306)|
| 1:28:32| And so I was being asked how and why was this gentleman allowed to come into Shenandoah two days the following week| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=5312)|
| 1:28:44| when apparently he had tried to go to maybe Central or Gresham, and those principals there did not allow this gentleman in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=5324)|
| 1:28:54| So I wanted to ask our school security so that the whole community, as well as all of Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=5334)|
| 1:29:02| would know what is the protocol that Knox County schools have in allowing individuals into our school buildings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=5342)|
| 1:29:13| and knowing that this has happened with this gentleman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=5353)|
| 1:29:18| So I just want this brought out in a public discussion so that the parents and the rest of the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=5358)|
| 1:29:26| and all the area knows do we leave this up to individual principals at each school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=5366)|
| 1:29:34| and who is responsible for, I guess, training this principal as to allowing this father in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=5374)|
| 1:29:42| So I'm sure we have some kind of a protocol as to how that's addressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=5382)|
| 1:29:49| I always show my ID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=5389)|
| 1:29:51| So I guess, would you like Russ to respond to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=5391)|
| 1:29:54| Well, I noticed that Gus is back there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=5394)|
| 1:29:57| So whoever, you know, this is my responsibility to address this for my district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=5397)|
| 1:30:03| and I want the parents and the people in District 2 to know what the protocol is and how this got by.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=5403)|
| 1:30:14| Okay. Russ, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=5414)|
| 1:30:16| Yes, sir. Russ Oaks, Knox County Schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=5416)|
| 1:30:18| And I'd like to address this, and if I run astray, Chief Producers can come down and correct me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=5418)|
| 1:30:28| But what I can do is I can't talk about a specific incident,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=5428)|
| 1:30:33| because when we start that we'll get into some areas and some information that's legally protected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=5433)|
| 1:30:39| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=5439)|
| 1:30:40| But I can talk a little bit about access to campuses and access to schools, and it's a little bit different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=5440)|
| 1:30:47| But when you talk about access to campuses, I understand our schools are a public place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=5447)|
| 1:30:54| but they are a controlled access public place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=5454)|
| 1:30:58| And what that means really is that to be there and be on the campus,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=5458)|
| 1:31:04| you need to have a reason to be on campus or business on campus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=5464)|
| 1:31:08| You need to have a child in school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=5468)|
| 1:31:10| or you need to be participating in an activity or an event that's taking place on that campus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=5470)|
| 1:31:18| Some people are prohibited from being on campus through legislation, through the law, sex offenders, for example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=5478)|
| 1:31:29| Now, if you have a child that's on that campus,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=5489)|
| 1:31:33| we have protocols where you can still come if you're a sex offender and pick up your child.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=5493)|
| 1:31:38| You just can't get out of your car.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=5498)|
| 1:31:40| You can come and meet with the principal or the teacher to discuss your child,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=5500)|
| 1:31:45| but it has to be a scheduled meeting, and everybody needs to know you're coming,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=5505)|
| 1:31:49| and there need to be protocols around that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=5509)|
| 1:31:52| We also have a process in place for individuals who present a threat| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=5512)|
| 1:32:00| or take a threatening action toward the school, toward students, toward our staff members,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=5520)|
| 1:32:08| or who become a disruption through their actions or activities to the school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=5528)|
| 1:32:15| and to the educational process of the school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=5535)|
| 1:32:18| And what we do on that is we issue generally what we call a no-trespass letter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=5538)|
| 1:32:25| and those are not issued lightly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=5545)|
| 1:32:28| I think we've issued about 650 of them over the last 10 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=5548)|
| 1:32:34| and those are issued in consultation with school principals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=5554)|
| 1:32:41| and with our security office and with central administration,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=5561)|
| 1:32:46| and they prohibit the individual who receives those letters| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=5566)|
| 1:32:52| from being on any Knox County Schools campus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=5572)|
| 1:32:59| That is, but then we do have protocols for individuals who have been issued those letters| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=5579)|
| 1:33:04| who have students in school, and they can still come and drop off their kids,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=5584)|
| 1:33:10| as long as you don't get out of the car.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=5590)|
| 1:33:12| They can still come and meet with teachers and principals if you have a scheduled meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=5592)|
| 1:33:18| and come in along that regard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=5598)|
| 1:33:22| So there are also what I would call other actions that we can take| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=5602)|
| 1:33:30| when individuals, you know, my term, have a bad day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=5610)|
| 1:33:34| I'm at the football game or the basketball game or I come to meet with a teacher| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=5614)|
| 1:33:38| and it's not going like I want it to go or I've got a problem| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=5618)|
| 1:33:43| and I get disruptive or verbally abusive or something at that day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=5623)|
| 1:33:48| and the principal can ask you to leave the campus or you can be escorted from campus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=5628)|
| 1:33:53| And that happens from time to time, but that's not something that we take,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=5633)|
| 1:33:57| necessarily take a permanent action like a no-trespass letter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=5637)|
| 1:34:07| So that's really what our process is as far as access to campus is concerned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=5647)|
| 1:34:14| If you're talking about access to the building where we keep the buildings locked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=5654)|
| 1:34:19| and the protocol when individuals come up to the doors, that's a whole separate process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=5659)|
| 1:34:25| I think the main question that I'm addressing is this father also apparently went to Central| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=5665)|
| 1:34:37| and maybe Gresham, I'm not sure, but they had the no trespassing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=5677)|
| 1:34:41| He was not allowed inside the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=5681)|
| 1:34:44| But Shannondale, he was allowed inside the building, from what I've been told,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=5684)|
| 1:34:49| and that he was allowed to go down to the clinic to pick up his child.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=5689)|
| 1:34:53| And he was in there twice in that one week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=5693)|
| 1:34:57| And the principal was aware of that because she had let the staff know on Monday morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=5697)|
| 1:35:03| So that's what I'm concerned about is to make sure, or who was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=5703)|
| 1:35:14| why would this principal drop the ball in allowing something like that to happen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=5714)|
| 1:35:20| I don't know that that's the case, but what I'd like to go back to what I initially said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=5720)|
| 1:35:25| is I can't talk about the specifics of a particular instance in this forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=5725)|
| 1:35:31| If you'd like to have a separate discussion, I'd be happy to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=5731)|
| 1:35:34| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=5734)|
| 1:35:36| Well, I mean, apparently there was a non-trespassing issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=5736)|
| 1:35:40| but I'm just wondering why she didn't receive that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=5740)|
| 1:35:43| or does it have to be individual principals to get that on their campus?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=5743)|
| 1:35:49| There may be an issue with the timeline that you're discussing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=5749)|
| 1:35:52| and I'd like to talk to you separately about it, but I can't do it in this forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=5752)|
| 1:35:57| Well, thank you for coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=5757)|
| 1:35:59| And I do know there's legal issues, but, as I said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=5759)|
| 1:36:04| it was my responsibility to address this for my community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=5764)|

| 1:41:54| Okay, and I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=6114)|
| 1:41:55| He did not tell me that, and I was unaware that you had requested that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=6115)|
| 1:42:00| I can give you a brief overview.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=6120)|
| 1:42:02| No, we're going to keep things moving here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=6122)|
| 1:42:04| I just wanted to â€“ I wish you would mail that out to â€“ email that to each of the commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=6124)|
| 1:42:09| I'll get it to all the commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=6129)|
| 1:42:10| I'll do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=6130)|
| 1:42:11| Again, I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=6131)|
| 1:42:12| I was unaware of that request, and I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=6132)|
| 1:42:15| Okay, thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=6135)|
| 1:42:16| Can I add?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=6136)|
| 1:42:17| Go ahead, Commissioner Anderson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=6137)|
| 1:42:18| The context of the conversation was we already give you a certain amount of money every year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=6138)|
| 1:42:23| What do we get?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=6143)|
| 1:42:24| I mean, you all make a lot of money from your developers, applications, and things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=6144)|
| 1:42:28| The question really for the commission is what do we get for that money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=6148)|
| 1:42:31| and why do we keep getting stacked with these little â€“ with fees, like from the school system and stuff?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=6151)|
| 1:42:35| Okay, I'll state again that our budget, about 12 percent comes from Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=6155)|
| 1:42:41| about 20 percent from the city of Knoxville, about â€“ depending on the year, 15 to 20 percent from fees and charges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=6161)|
| 1:42:50| The majority, 40-plus percent, comes from administrative funds attached to grants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=6170)|
| 1:42:56| So, again, Knox County gets a great deal providing 12 percent of our funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=6176)|
| 1:43:03| In return for dealing with our developers, working, for example, at the request of Commissioner Daley,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=6183)|
| 1:43:10| we're doing the John Sevier Scenic Highway Corridor Plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=6190)|
| 1:43:14| We do a lot of administrative work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=6194)|
| 1:43:16| Aren't we paying for that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=6196)|
| 1:43:17| Pardon?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=6197)|
| 1:43:18| Didn't that come at a cost?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=6198)|
| 1:43:19| No, no cost, no additional cost for the John Sevier Scenic Highway Corridor Plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=6199)|
| 1:43:23| We deal with applicants on a daily basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=6203)|
| 1:43:27| Our fees pay about 50 percent of the cost of handling the â€“ administering the request for rezonings and use on reviews.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=6207)|
| 1:43:37| So, again â€“| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=6217)|
| 1:43:38| I mean, I was just giving you context.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=6218)|
| 1:43:39| You don't have to explain it right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=6219)|
| 1:43:41| And what we do with â€“ for the school, what we do, we look at all the development activity in the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=6221)|
| 1:43:48| identify what area that occurs, do projections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=6228)|
| 1:43:53| Our research folks do projections, map that out where that growth is going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=6233)|
| 1:43:58| So, it's work that's outside the normal day-to-day planning activity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=6238)|
| 1:44:02| That's the gist of the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=6242)|
| 1:44:04| What is the normal day-to-day activity services you do for Knox County for that $800,000?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=6244)|
| 1:44:09| If you'd please just send it to us, we'd be happy to read it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=6249)|
| 1:44:12| Perfect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=6252)|
| 1:44:13| And this is $46,000 over, I think, a four- or five-year period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=6253)|
| 1:44:18| And to clarify, that's not 46 per year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=6258)|
| 1:44:20| That is divided out over â€“ that's the total number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=6260)|
| 1:44:23| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=6263)|

| 1:57:13| All in favor, please say aye. Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=7033)|
| 1:57:15| All opposed, please say nay. The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=7035)|
| 1:57:18| Okay, Madam Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=7038)|
| 1:57:19| Okay, this is still under the general government consent. This was moved off. It's consideration of a resolution of the Commission of Knox County, Tennessee reappointing Janet Bosnick as assistant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=7039)|
| 1:57:37| I think, was that item 21? Yeah, 21 has been moved forward to next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=7057)|
| 1:57:46| There's another one. 39. 39 is the one we got.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=7066)|
| 1:57:52| Number 39, consideration of a resolution of the Commission of Knox County, Tennessee approving Amendment 2 to the Knox County Indigent Care Program Agreement, which amendment reduces the total amount of money available for services in fiscal year 2019-2020 and provides for other revisions to the reimbursement of services section of the agreement. Resolution 604.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=7072)|
| 1:58:16| Make a motion to send, or to make a motion to postpone until June so we can have our budget discussion. This is kind of putting the cart before the horse. We haven't voted on the budget yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=7096)|
| 1:58:27| And so I'd like to make a motion that we do this in June. I'd like to get, I have some more questions that I'd like answered and I'd probably like to do those with Dr. Buchanan, maybe more on a, just to get more understanding of it and maybe some Cherokee folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=7107)|
| 1:58:41| Okay. There's a motion on the floor to postpone to June. Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=7121)|
| 1:58:48| All right. I'm sorry. I heard the second over here. Second from Commissioner Biggs. Okay. All right. Discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=7128)|
| 1:58:56| All right. Sorry. Okay. Commissioner Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=7136)|
| 1:58:58| Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And I think the conversation also has to take place with looking at, because I know we got an email earlier in the day about some breakdowns of those commitments to those organizations and a little bit more explanation provided to help support which was what was sent to make a better informed decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=7138)|
| 1:59:25| Okay. Well, so I guess your point on that is, I don't want to put words in your mouth, but you're saying, hey, we got some additional information and you'd like to learn more about that or have additional time to follow up with Mr. Caldwell or others. Is that kind of what you're saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=7165)|
| 1:59:39| Yes, that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=7179)|
| 1:59:40| You'd like a little more time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=7180)|
| 1:59:41| Yes, that's correct. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=7181)|
| 1:59:42| Okay. All right. Thank you. Commissioner Daley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=7182)|
| 1:59:44| Yeah, I agree with Mr. Anders. I'd like to make an appointment with Dr. Buchanan next Monday or Tuesday just for 30 minutes or so, but I guess we'd like to do it individually, I guess, so we don't have to. So we don't have to. What was the comment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=7184)|
| 2:00:00| You got to make a co-pay if you're going to make an appointment with Dr. Buchanan. Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=7200)|
| 2:00:05| Anyway, clowns, I would like to meet with you, so I second that, that we do need some time to discuss. And I would like to see Cherokee Health here too, also, if it's possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=7205)|
| 2:00:19| Okay. All right. Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=7219)|
| 2:00:24| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=7224)|
| 2:00:27| Chris, if we put this vote off on the contract until after, I'm assuming Commissioner Anders is talking about June meeting of commission, that will be after we've already approved a budget, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=7227)|
| 2:00:43| That's correct. And I think what he's saying, that's okay. I think he's saying if you approve a budget on June the 6th, as is, then he's okay with taking this contract then in June for the same amount.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=7243)|
| 2:00:55| He's saying if there's an amendment to the budget, don't approve this article now, is what he's saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=7255)|
| 2:01:02| I think historically, and Dr. Buchanan and I talked about this today, historically, I think we have tried to bring this around the same time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=7262)|
| 2:01:10| Oftentimes, the budget's been approved at the May meetings, and so it works hand in hand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=7270)|
| 2:01:18| I know that she was just getting it on the agenda because it's protocol and it's the right thing to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=7278)|
| 2:01:23| But I don't think a deferral changes anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=7283)|
| 2:01:27| Okay. So we'll be voting on the budget before we vote on this contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=7287)|
| 2:01:32| But in essence, if you vote for the budget, you vote for the contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=7292)|
| 2:01:37| Technically, yeah, because there's a lot of contracts in the budget that you approve afterwards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=7297)|
| 2:01:43| The thing I don't like about that is if we all have these individual meetings with Dr. Buchanan, the public is robbed the access and the knowledge of what these conversations are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=7303)|
| 2:01:52| I have no problem being open and honest and transparent on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=7312)|
| 2:01:57| I have questions, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=7317)|
| 2:02:00| This is a hot topic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=7320)|
| 2:02:03| It's very dear and near to a lot of people because it touches on some very sensitive things that echo throughout all of our country, actually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=7323)|
| 2:02:15| But there's a lot of information that the public, I think, needs to know that they won't get by us all having closed-door conversations with Dr. Buchanan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=7335)|
| 2:02:26| Dr. Buchanan, are any of the providers here today?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=7346)|
| 2:02:31| They are not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=7351)|
| 2:02:33| Okay. Why are they not here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=7353)|
| 2:02:38| I guess you can't answer that. I'm sorry. It was a hypothetical question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=7358)|
| 2:02:43| You know, we could certainly, if you wanted to, we could make the summaries of meetings, if the commissioners are willing, public record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=7363)|
| 2:02:53| You could post them on your forum or wherever you choose to post them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=7373)|
| 2:02:58| We can post them, but I guess there also may be, and we've got 15 minutes before we begin our zoning, but there also may be some good questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=7378)|
| 2:03:06| You can do both in that we may have some questions that we want to ask tonight, which I think is the right thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=7386)|
| 2:03:13| But then there's also some commissioners may be doing homework on their own and may feel more comfortable following up with you directly, Dr. Buchanan, which is understandable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=7393)|
| 2:03:24| I know I've had a few questions as well that I've had to call you directly on and say, what does this mean?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=7404)|
| 2:03:28| How are we here on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=7408)|
| 2:03:30| And as someone who worked in the social work field, you know, I get this and there are some questions that I had as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=7410)|
| 2:03:38| So with that said, Commissioner Smith, you've got your light on and you were first recognized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=7418)|
| 2:03:43| So I'd like if you have any questions right now for Dr. Buchanan, give you that opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=7423)|
| 2:03:49| Then we will proceed in order of as I've done my best to try and see everybody in order up until seven o'clock when we have our zoning meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=7429)|
| 2:04:00| I might also suggest that we do a brief 10 minute recess and begin zoning, which has got a fairly quick agenda at about 7.10.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=7440)|
| 2:04:11| So does that that's as chair's call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=7451)|
| 2:04:14| So go ahead, Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=7454)|
| 2:04:15| Dr. Buchanan, do you have any?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=7455)|
| 2:04:17| I'm sorry, Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=7457)|
| 2:04:19| Do I need to introduce myself?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=7459)|
| 2:04:21| You are Dr. Buchanan from the Knox County Health Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=7461)|
| 2:04:23| 140 Damron Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=7463)|
| 2:04:24| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=7464)|
| 2:04:25| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=7465)|
| 2:04:26| Just Dr. Buchanan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=7466)|
| 2:04:27| Do you have a breakdown of where the dollars and how many dollars will be leaving each provider?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=7467)|
| 2:04:34| Each each category?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=7474)|
| 2:04:36| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=7476)|
| 2:04:37| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=7477)|
| 2:04:38| Each category.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=7478)|
| 2:04:39| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=7479)|
| 2:04:40| So we have four categories of payment in this in this program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=7480)|
| 2:04:45| Cherokee Health durable medical equipment, which is not not reduced at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=7485)|
| 2:04:50| We pay full price for that specialty physician care and hospital care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=7490)|
| 2:04:54| And so Cherokee Health has been funded at one million two hundred thirty five thousand dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=7494)|
| 2:05:02| And they will be reduced to six hundred and ninety five thousand dollars in just this contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=7502)|
| 2:05:09| The other contract that we have with Cherokee Health is what you had in that e-mail of three hundred and six.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=7509)|
| 2:05:16| Nine hundred and eighty nine thousand dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=7516)|
| 2:05:18| That is for primary care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=7518)|
| 2:05:20| So there's the engine care and the primary care piece.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=7520)|
| 2:05:23| They all go to the same place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=7523)|
| 2:05:24| That all goes to Cherokee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=7524)|
| 2:05:25| That contract is not changing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=7525)|
| 2:05:27| Do you have a breakdown the difference in dollars from last year to this year under this proposal?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=7527)|
| 2:05:32| I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=7532)|
| 2:05:33| I actually have it in a summary table that I could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=7533)|
| 2:05:35| I just want to hear it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=7535)|
| 2:05:36| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=7536)|
| 2:05:37| Oh, OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=7537)|
| 2:05:38| So Cherokee Health is decreasing by five hundred forty thousand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=7538)|
| 2:05:44| The medical equipment is staying the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=7544)|
| 2:05:45| We use all the money in that budget and that is not a discounted cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=7545)|
| 2:05:50| Specialty physicians is dropping by five hundred thousand dollars to a million dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=7550)|
| 2:05:54| Hospital share is going from one million three hundred eighty one and five to one million dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=7554)|
| 2:06:01| We're getting a cut of three hundred eighty one thousand five hundred dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=7561)|
| 2:06:07| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=7567)|
| 2:06:08| Do you know if the hospitals in Cherokee have any federal contract that also provides indigent care funding to them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=7568)|
| 2:06:17| I know more about Cherokee than the hospitals and I don't know about the hospitals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=7577)|
| 2:06:23| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=7583)|
| 2:06:24| Cherokee is what's called a federally qualified health center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=7584)|
| 2:06:27| which means they get federal funding to help see the under and uninsured.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=7587)|
| 2:06:32| And so they have several different funding streams that allow them to see people without insurance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=7592)|
| 2:06:37| This is just one of the funding streams that they have for funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=7597)|
| 2:06:40| You certainly could ask them more detail about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=7600)|
| 2:06:43| But the federally qualified health center piece means that if they see a TennCare patient and they say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=7603)|
| 2:06:50| I'm making this up, TennCare pays them seventy cents on the dollar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=7610)|
| 2:06:55| They probably don't pay that much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=7615)|
| 2:06:56| It's more like thirty cents on the dollar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=7616)|
| 2:06:58| The federal government makes up that other portion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=7618)|
| 2:07:00| So they get paid dollar for dollar for every TennCare patient they see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=7620)|
| 2:07:04| Most providers do not get that payment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=7624)|
| 2:07:06| And then again they have other funding streams that allow them to see people on a sliding scale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=7626)|
| 2:07:11| They also participate in what's called a 340B pharmacy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=7631)|
| 2:07:14| 340B pharmacy is a purchasing program that allows you to purchase drugs that are reduced cost and some other things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=7634)|
| 2:07:22| But that's the big piece of it for this program is it reduces the cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=7642)|
| 2:07:25| When we had it after we lost that qualification, our cost for drugs went up by about a factor of four when we had this program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=7645)|
| 2:07:35| So that's another reason we transferred this over to Cherokee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=7655)|
| 2:07:39| Do they receive any funding from the state?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=7659)|
| 2:07:41| I do not know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=7661)|
| 2:07:43| Any private grants or anything like that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=7663)|
| 2:07:44| I don't know the details of the rest of their funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=7664)|
| 2:07:46| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=7666)|
| 2:07:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=7667)|
| 2:07:48| Thank you, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=7668)|
| 2:07:49| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=7669)|
| 2:07:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=7670)|
| 2:07:51| Mr. Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=7671)|
| 2:07:52| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=7672)|
| 2:07:54| Dr. Buchanan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=7674)|
| 2:07:55| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=7675)|
| 2:07:56| I had a question from two people before I got out here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=7676)|
| 2:08:00| My phone rang, and they were saying that most of the reduction is coming in the drug form,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=7680)|
| 2:08:07| which they're not going to reduce the service, but they're going to reduce drugs that were prescribed at these facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=7687)|
| 2:08:16| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=7696)|
| 2:08:18| Not to my understanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=7698)|
| 2:08:21| In the contract, the way it's written, each person has a $7 limit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=7701)|
| 2:08:27| I'm not sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=7707)|
| 2:08:28| It's not $7.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=7708)|
| 2:08:29| Seven prescription limit, which is the same as TennCare, for the number of prescriptions they can get through the Cherokee pharmacy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=7709)|
| 2:08:36| And that's the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=7716)|
| 2:08:37| We put that in place because TennCare has that same guideline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=7717)|
| 2:08:40| And we're not changing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=7720)|
| 2:08:41| That's not changing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=7721)|
| 2:08:43| So what you're saying, what they had last year in prescriptions will be the same this year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=7723)|
| 2:08:49| We'd have to specifically ask that question to Cherokee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=7729)|
| 2:08:52| We did not discuss changing pharmacy benefits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=7732)|
| 2:08:54| We actually discussed decreasing the enrollment, meaning there would be fewer people on this program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=7734)|
| 2:09:01| but they'd be served on a different program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=7741)|
| 2:09:04| Again, Cherokee has many funding streams to provide primary care to the under and uninsured.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=7744)|
| 2:09:09| It's their mission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=7749)|
| 2:09:12| But what they were really concerned is when they were talking to Cherokee, what they'd used in the past,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=7752)|
| 2:09:17| they were saying that their prescription drugs would decrease in the amount that they could get.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=7757)|
| 2:09:23| But you're saying it does not happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=7763)|
| 2:09:24| I'll have to go back and ask that question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=7764)|
| 2:09:25| We actually talked about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=7765)|
| 2:09:26| Could you get me the answer so I can call them back and let them know?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=7766)|
| 2:09:28| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=7768)|
| 2:09:29| Seven prescription limit and no discussion about changing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=7769)|
| 2:09:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=7771)|
| 2:09:32| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=7772)|
| 2:09:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=7773)|
| 2:09:34| Thank you, Commissioner Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=7774)|
| 2:09:35| Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=7775)|
| 2:09:36| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=7776)|
| 2:09:38| Dr. Buchanan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=7778)|
| 2:09:39| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=7779)|
| 2:09:40| This commission has seen over the years, whether it's a program that might lose funding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=7780)|
| 2:09:46| or have the potential to lose funding on a small level or a big level,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=7786)|
| 2:09:51| defined services groups that may have as little as $20,000 or $30,000 or $40,000 changes in budget year to year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=7791)|
| 2:09:58| have massive engagement, whether it be 1,000 people in this hall or outside the door| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=7798)|
| 2:10:05| or an entire group of people rallying for support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=7805)|
| 2:10:08| And we've been talking about this budget for well over a month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=7808)|
| 2:10:12| We have not heard from any of the providers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=7812)|
| 2:10:15| It just seems incredibly odd that all of the people who are, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=7815)|
| 2:10:21| the proposed cuts are affecting are absolutely silent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=7821)|
| 2:10:24| And I don't know what the question is for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=7824)|
| 2:10:28| Do you find that odd that we've not heard from anybody?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=7828)|
| 2:10:33| We've not seen anybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=7833)|
| 2:10:34| We've not had groups of people here rallying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=7834)|
| 2:10:37| It's been silent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=7837)|
| 2:10:41| I don't really, I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=7841)|
| 2:10:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=7844)|
| 2:10:45| I mean, is there any other discussion behind the scenes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=7845)|
| 2:10:48| Is there any other?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=7848)|
| 2:10:49| No, I mean, I met with, we met with the hospitals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=7849)|
| 2:10:51| I've met with Cherokee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=7851)|
| 2:10:54| And, you know, my advice was for them to do whatever they thought was appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=7854)|
| 2:11:00| And, you know, because they did ask me what they should do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=7860)|
| 2:11:03| and I told them they should do whatever they thought was appropriate, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=7863)|
| 2:11:07| as far as if they wanted to talk to their commissioners or talk to you as a body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=7867)|
| 2:11:12| But the very first question asked about this subject, again, almost a month ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=7872)|
| 2:11:16| was will the amount of people be served be less?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=7876)|
| 2:11:22| Will care change?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=7882)|
| 2:11:23| Or will they find other revenue sources?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=7883)|
| 2:11:26| And the answer, if I remember correctly, was no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=7886)|
| 2:11:30| They will continue to serve the people that are in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=7890)|
| 2:11:33| They may just find other sources for the revenue gap that is not solely dependent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=7893)|
| 2:11:38| or, you know, not a majority dependent on Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=7898)|
| 2:11:40| And, you know, you've read Dennis Freeman's quotes, and when I spoke with him,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=7900)|
| 2:11:47| he said their intention is not to turn anyone away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=7907)|
| 2:11:51| Their mission is to serve people who are uninsured or underinsured.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=7911)|
| 2:11:55| I know it's a hard position to speak on behalf of somebody else,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=7915)|
| 2:11:58| but you are the representative of the group that administers this program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=7918)|
| 2:12:01| and maybe by default you do represent them as well because you're the point person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=7921)|
| 2:12:06| So I appreciate the comments, and thanks for doing your best to give us the best answers we can get.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=7926)|
| 2:12:12| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=7932)|
| 2:12:13| Okay. Thank you, Commissioner Jay, Commissioner Daley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=7933)|
| 2:12:16| I know Commissioner Gill had spoken on this a little earlier, so, yeah, you're due.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=7936)|
| 2:12:22| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=7942)|
| 2:12:23| Dr. Buchanan, along the lines of Commissioner Jay, I've got a few.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=7943)|
| 2:12:29| I've got phone calls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=7949)|
| 2:12:31| You know, when you get phone calls, it's more important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=7951)|
| 2:12:34| And the questions they ask, there are seniors out there that are scared to death.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=7954)|
| 2:12:39| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=7959)|
| 2:12:40| I need to confirm and I need to let them know that their services will not be cut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=7960)|
| 2:12:46| When you say seniors, can you please define that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=7966)|
| 2:12:48| Well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=7968)|
| 2:12:50| Because if they're over 65, they're not served in this program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=7970)|
| 2:12:52| Right, and that's the exact answer I told them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=7972)|
| 2:12:54| 18 to 64.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=7974)|
| 2:12:56| Yeah, that's exactly what I said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=7976)|
| 2:12:57| The first question I asked them if they're 65 or older, which is Medicare or Medicaid,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=7977)|
| 2:13:01| whichever one they're on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=7981)|
| 2:13:03| And then the next question is, are you making above $500 a month?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=7983)|
| 2:13:07| And if they said no, I said nothing's going to change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=7987)|
| 2:13:10| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=7990)|
| 2:13:11| And I just want to make sure that I am telling them the correct thing because I don't want it to come back,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=7991)|
| 2:13:19| and I've told them something that's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=7999)|
| 2:13:22| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=8002)|
| 2:13:23| I do think there's a lot of confusion about who this program serves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=8003)|
| 2:13:27| It's a small portion, a very needy, very important part of our community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=8007)|
| 2:13:32| but it's a small portion of our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=8012)|
| 2:13:34| If you have TennCare, if you have Medicare, if you have insurance, if you go to Interfaith,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=8014)|
| 2:13:40| I mean, those programs are not impacted by this funding at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=8020)|
| 2:13:44| And you feel comfortable with the budget?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=8024)|
| 2:13:46| I feel comfortable with the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=8026)|
| 2:13:48| I think one of the things, and one of the things the mayor has asked,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=8028)|
| 2:13:52| is that we be more creative about how we meet these needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=8032)|
| 2:13:56| And since I've been looking at this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=8036)|
| 2:14:00| I've learned that actually the Nashville-Davidson County Health Department works more with their project access than we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=8040)|
| 2:14:08| So I think one of the conversations I'll be having in the next few weeks is with project access| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=8048)|
| 2:14:13| and how can we leverage what they do to better serve these folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=8053)|
| 2:14:16| So it's on me and some of my staff to look at those options| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=8056)|
| 2:14:20| and to work with our partners like Cherokee and Project Access and others to maximize access to what's out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=8060)|
| 2:14:29| Another ask that I've had from one of my Board of Health members is to really assess what's out there to serve folks who are not insured.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=8069)|
| 2:14:40| That's a hard thing to do, but we're going to have to buckle down to do it, but it's just challenging.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=8080)|
| 2:14:45| There are a lot of folks out there doing a lot of good work, and it's hard to kind of track who they serve and keep that straight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=8085)|
| 2:14:53| So we're going to work hard to do that, and it's on us to do those things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=8093)|
| 2:14:58| and maybe do things a little bit differently, leveraging more of our community partners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=8098)|
| 2:15:03| and other community efforts that are already going on to better serve folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=8103)|
| 2:15:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=8107)|
| 2:15:08| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=8108)|
| 2:15:09| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=8109)|
| 2:15:10| Thank you, Commissioner Daley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=8110)|
| 2:15:11| I think, Commissioner Gill, you had spoken on this earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=8111)|
| 2:15:14| I've got just a quick question or statement before we go into a brief break.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=8114)|
| 2:15:19| As I was drilling down on the program over this weekend,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=8119)|
| 2:15:22| I noticed that the actual proposed reduction in funding for Cherokee was about 43 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=8122)|
| 2:15:29| Then when we look at the physician's program, that was around 28 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=8129)|
| 2:15:33| And then when we got to the hospitals, it was around 14 percent, rounding off just a little bit there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=8133)|
| 2:15:40| But as I understood this program in its entirety, you're basically starting off with Cherokee Health as the quarterback,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=8140)|
| 2:15:45| if you will, the manager of the program and the provider of primary care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=8145)|
| 2:15:49| Your next layer, your tier down, is going to be the specialty physicians on a referral basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=8149)|
| 2:15:56| And then the third tier are the hospitals, which, as I basically understand it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=8156)|
| 2:16:01| are given a grant with the remaining proceeds of money in the program on a quarterly basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=8161)|
| 2:16:07| Is that kind of a, I'm not going to pretend to be an expert on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=8167)|
| 2:16:11| but is that kind of a good summary of the program?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=8171)|
| 2:16:14| I think we do use the language grant in the contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=8174)|
| 2:16:17| However, it's based on number of patient days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=8177)|
| 2:16:21| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=8181)|
| 2:16:22| So Hospital X serves this many people for this many days, and once a quarter they submit that to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=8182)|
| 2:16:29| And so we divide that million dollars based on number of patient days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=8189)|
| 2:16:35| So if there are more patient days, they get less money, and it's always been that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=8195)|
| 2:16:40| And a little more historic perspective, when I looked at how to do this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=8200)|
| 2:16:47| through the Burchett administration we reduced the hospital portion of this contract in smaller amounts over time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=8207)|
| 2:16:55| It came before commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=8215)|
| 2:16:56| Commission approved that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=8216)|
| 2:16:57| I think that was one of the times we delayed vote on this contract was when we did that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=8217)|
| 2:17:01| And we really targeted the hospitals and had reduced what we were paying them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=8221)|
| 2:17:05| So when the mayor came to me and asked for me to look at this again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=8225)|
| 2:17:09| I looked at it differently because we had reduced what the hospitals were getting paid over time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=8229)|
| 2:17:14| And so I just made a different choice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=8234)|
| 2:17:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=8237)|
| 2:17:18| So just a little historic perspective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=8238)|
| 2:17:20| Yeah, and I may have additional questions, but I want to get to Commissioner Gill briefly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=8240)|
| 2:17:24| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=8244)|
| 2:17:26| And this is a policy observation as well as a procedural observation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=8246)|
| 2:17:31| because we get submitted recommendations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=8251)|
| 2:17:36| but this is a moral statement that impacts the most vulnerable population of people in this community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=8256)|
| 2:17:42| And really that statement to cut this funding at this level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=8262)|
| 2:17:48| But you made two critical observations about the potential to look more in advance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=8268)|
| 2:17:55| of how we could have better spread this cost out to our stakeholders and not at this one fell swoop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=8275)|
| 2:18:02| And procedurally we're faced with a critical moral and policy decision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=8282)|
| 2:18:08| and as a body we could have made better recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=8288)|
| 2:18:11| And I just need to really say that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=8291)|
| 2:18:14| Because we're faced with the budget recommendations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=8294)|
| 2:18:17| and we could then make better decisions months ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=8297)|
| 2:18:22| And if we're looking at how we as a body look at how our relationship is with our community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=8302)|
| 2:18:31| this really impacts morally the fact that we are making poor decisions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=8311)|
| 2:18:36| on people who cannot come here and say that this is not an acceptable cut,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=8316)|
| 2:18:42| because it's not acceptable to me, no matter how we want to try to define it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=8322)|
| 2:18:47| And I think long term we could have looked at this policy and this budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=8327)|
| 2:18:51| and said we need these community people at the table, but we did not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=8331)|
| 2:18:56| So I think that is part of a greater discussion we have to have about where this county is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=8336)|
| 2:19:04| and the role and function that we need to do in order to serve people better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=8344)|
| 2:19:09| Thank you, Commissioner Gill, for those points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=8349)|
| 2:19:10| Commissioner Schoonmaker, now we're getting ready to close and move into.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=8350)|
| 2:19:13| This will be very quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=8353)|
| 2:19:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=8354)|
| 2:19:15| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=8355)|
| 2:19:16| Last week, did you state that this program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=8356)|
| 2:19:23| most of the participants live inside the city of Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=8363)|
| 2:19:28| and that the city of Knoxville does not appropriate any funds towards indigent care as part of their budget?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=8368)|
| 2:19:36| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=8376)|
| 2:19:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=8377)|
| 2:19:38| Have they ever participated in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=8378)|
| 2:19:42| Not in any of the history I can find, so not to my knowledge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=8382)|
| 2:19:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=8386)|
| 2:19:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=8387)|
| 2:19:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=8388)|
| 2:19:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=8389)|
| 2:19:50| Dr. Buchanan, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=8390)|
| 2:19:51| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=8391)|
| 2:19:52| As someone who worked in the social work field for a while before I got elected here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=8392)|
| 2:19:57| this is a very important part of what we do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=8397)|
| 2:20:01| and I appreciate this commission being intentional as we review this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=8401)|
| 2:20:06| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=8406)|
| 2:20:07| So I'm sure you'll be hearing more from us, and we'll discuss this at next month's meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=8407)|
| 2:20:12| Operationally, we're going to close the discussion tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=8412)|
| 2:20:16| I'd like to give our board time to take a quick break, and then upon return we'll resume zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=8416)|
| 2:20:26| So, yeah, excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=8426)|
| 2:20:27| There is a motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=8427)|
| 2:20:29| The motion maker, Commissioner Anders, I think is in the room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=8429)|
| 2:20:32| Okay, there he is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=8432)|
| 2:20:33| So to restate this, the motion on the floor is to move this forward to next month's meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=8433)|
| 2:20:38| Does it count if he's not up here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=8438)|
| 2:20:40| Well, and I want to be clear, you know, if this needs to take place in the context of our budget discussion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=8440)|
| 2:20:47| the way our budget discussion is laid out, there will be probably four questions before you around tax rates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=8447)|
| 2:20:52| or around specific appropriations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=8452)|
| 2:20:55| The way that agenda will be laid out, it will be as if any other discussion item that we have before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=8455)|
| 2:21:03| So in the context of the budget, that will be a potential discussion matter when we have our budget meeting next,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=8463)|
| 2:21:11| excuse me, Thursday, the 6th of June.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=8471)|
| 2:21:15| So that would be an opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=8475)|
| 2:21:17| And correct me if I'm wrong, Mr. Long, in fact, I even reached out to you to confirm that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=8477)|
| 2:21:21| that when we have our budget discussion and are to vote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=8481)|
| 2:21:25| any questions they have if it's something pertaining to the budget can take place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=8485)|
| 2:21:35| It can be discussed and the appropriation can be made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=8495)|
| 2:21:40| This is just a contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=8500)|
| 2:21:42| So the appropriation can be made, a contract can be voted up or down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=8502)|
| 2:21:47| just like you do any other contract at any other time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=8507)|
| 2:21:50| The June deferral would give an opportunity to vote up or down a contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=8510)|
| 2:21:55| And that's basically all this is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=8515)|
| 2:21:57| Your appropriation would be in place, however you do your appropriation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=8517)|
| 2:22:02| would be in place either to have the resources to do this or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=8522)|
| 2:22:07| But that's part of the budget discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=8527)|
| 2:22:10| But we have a motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=8530)|
| 2:22:13| Which is to move the contract forward to the June meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=8533)|
| 2:22:15| So I'll go ahead there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=8535)|
| 2:22:17| It was a proper second on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=8537)|
| 2:22:21| I want to verify.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=8541)|
| 2:22:22| Brad, I know, was the motion maker and I believe the second was Commissioner Biggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=8542)|
| 2:22:25| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=8545)|
| 2:22:29| Was it Biggs or Beeler?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=8549)|
| 2:22:30| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=8550)|
| 2:22:31| Madam Clerk, do you have that in the record?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=8551)|
| 2:22:33| It was Biggs for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=8553)|
| 2:22:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=8555)|
| 2:22:36| So is there any additional discussion on this item,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=8556)|
| 2:22:39| which was to restate to move this forward to next month's meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=8559)|
| 2:22:42| All in favor of this, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=8562)|

| 2:23:15| Madam Clerk, would you please read out item number 56?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=8595)|
| 2:23:21| This is 3-F-19-RZ, request of Thomas Drexel for residing from a agricultural to PR plan residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=8601)|
| 2:23:29| at a density up to five dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=8609)|
| 2:23:33| Located southwest side of Quorum Road, southeast of Billy Neal Lane in the 8th Commission District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=8613)|
| 2:23:39| What was your question, Mr. Skinner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=8619)|
| 2:23:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=8624)|

| 2:23:47| Thank you, Mr. Chair, members of the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=8627)|
| 2:23:50| The Knoxville-Knox County Planning Commission recommended by a vote of 14-0 that the county commission approve PR zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=8630)|
| 2:23:58| at a density up to three dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=8638)|
| 2:24:01| The applicant did request five dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=8641)|
| 2:24:04| The commission felt that three dwelling units per acre would be consistent with the land use designation for the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=8644)|
| 2:24:11| and also consistent with the surrounding development and could be served by the existing infrastructure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=8651)|
| 2:24:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=8658)|
| 2:24:19| Is the applicant present?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=8659)|

| 2:24:26| Sir, if you could please approach the podium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=8666)|
| 2:24:33| While he's coming, why did you demote him to commissioner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=8673)|
| 2:24:36| I know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=8676)|
| 2:24:37| I was going to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=8677)|
| 2:24:38| I took that as a compliment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=8678)|
| 2:24:39| Mr. Green, I was going to say, please forgive me for the insult by calling you commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=8679)|
| 2:24:43| I thought it was a compliment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=8683)|

| 2:25:04| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=8704)|
| 2:25:05| Mr. Driscoll, I'll give you just ten seconds or so to tell us about the property, then we'll move on to the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=8705)|

| 2:25:22| And, yeah, the three units per acre sounds good to my sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=8722)|
| 2:25:28| Reasonable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=8728)|
