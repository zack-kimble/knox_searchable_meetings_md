| 0:01:27| Six present, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=87)|
| 0:01:28| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=88)|
| 0:01:29| All right, so we'll get started on our topic today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=89)|
| 0:01:32| which is Home Rule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=92)|
| 0:01:34| Home Rule is a matter in which all of us on City Council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=94)|
| 0:01:37| as well as all of us that make Knoxville our home| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=97)|
| 0:01:40| and citizens across the state, have a special interest in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=100)|
| 0:01:44| Each of us have an obligation to educate ourselves| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=104)|
| 0:01:47| about this topic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=107)|
| 0:01:49| The topic that we're talking about today reminds me of a quote| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=109)|
| 0:01:52| that I think everyone's familiar with from Howard Baker,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=112)|
| 0:01:55| who had said at one point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=115)|
| 0:01:57| I subscribe to the theory that the best government| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=117)|
| 0:02:00| is the closest government wherever possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=120)|
| 0:02:03| And I think that really encapsulates a lot of the discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=123)|
| 0:02:05| that we're going to have this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=125)|
| 0:02:07| But tonight we're going to focus on Home Rule in Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=127)|
| 0:02:11| because that's a subject that certainly has been in the news a lot of late,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=131)|
| 0:02:15| and we definitely want to be better educated on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=135)|
| 0:02:21| To help us better understand Home Rule,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=141)|
| 0:02:24| we've assembled a distinguished group of experts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=144)|
| 0:02:28| who are visiting with us tonight, some in person and some virtually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=148)|
| 0:02:35| Tonight, City Council welcomes former Tennessee Attorney General Bob Cooper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=155)|
| 0:02:40| Welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=160)|
| 0:02:42| Davidson County Clerk Brenda Wynn. Welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=162)|
| 0:02:46| And participating remotely, we have Metro Nashville Law Director Wally Dietz.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=166)|
| 0:02:52| Welcome, Mr. Dietz, Director Dietz.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=172)|
| 0:02:55| So let's go ahead and get started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=175)|
| 0:02:57| General Cooper, thank you for taking the time to travel to Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=177)|
| 0:03:01| and join us today, and we look forward to your presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=181)|
| 0:03:07| Thank you, Mr. Vice Mayor, and pleasure to be here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=187)|
| 0:03:10| pleasure to be with the Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=190)|
| 0:03:13| And this is, I feel honored to be with this group| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=193)|
| 0:03:18| who are talking to you today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=198)|
| 0:03:21| Let me say that my goal here is to address| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=201)|
| 0:03:26| and go into the history of Home Rule in Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=206)|
| 0:03:30| because I think to understand what's going on today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=210)|
| 0:03:33| you really need to go back to when Home Rule was initiated and even before that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=213)|
| 0:03:38| And I will say that really my knowledge of this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=218)|
| 0:03:43| is more recent than my time as the State Attorney General.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=223)|
| 0:03:47| I also, prior to Mr. Dietz,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=227)|
| 0:03:49| served as the Law Director for the City of Nashville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=229)|
| 0:03:52| and had some significant litigation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=232)|
| 0:03:57| involving the Home Rule Amendment and the piece of state legislation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=237)|
| 0:04:01| So that's a little bit of the context of what I'm bringing to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=241)|
| 0:04:05| But to talk about Home Rule,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=245)|
| 0:04:08| let's first go back to the days before Home Rule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=248)|
| 0:04:12| And until 1953, the Tennessee General Assembly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=252)|
| 0:04:17| could basically do whatever it wanted to do with local government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=257)|
| 0:04:22| Let me give you a couple of examples.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=262)|
| 0:04:25| In 1879, the General Assembly revoked the charter of the City of Memphis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=265)|
| 0:04:31| abolished all of the city offices,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=271)|
| 0:04:34| took ownership of all the city property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=274)|
| 0:04:37| and created a new government creatively called the Taxing District,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=277)|
| 0:04:42| which had three commissioners, two of which were appointed by the government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=282)|
| 0:04:47| So that's a fairly radical restructuring of local government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=287)|
| 0:04:53| In Nashville, while never something quite that drastic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=293)|
| 0:04:57| the General Assembly repealed the City of Nashville's charter three times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=297)|
| 0:05:02| And in one of those repeals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=302)|
| 0:05:04| the legislature transferred the mayor's power to the chief of police,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=304)|
| 0:05:09| who had been appointed by the previous mayor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=309)|
| 0:05:12| not the current mayor that they ousted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=312)|
| 0:05:15| So how could the General Assembly do this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=315)|
| 0:05:18| Well, that's because there was nothing in the state constitution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=318)|
| 0:05:21| to stop them from doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=321)|
| 0:05:23| Cities were recognized as, quote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=323)|
| 0:05:25| creatures of the state that existed at the General Assembly's discretion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=325)|
| 0:05:31| Counties, at least, were recognized in the state constitution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=331)|
| 0:05:36| but only as geographic areas that had certain constitutional officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=336)|
| 0:05:41| Operationally, the counties were really just considered agencies of the state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=341)|
| 0:05:46| that performed state functions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=346)|
| 0:05:48| For example, law enforcement through the constitutional office of sheriff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=348)|
| 0:05:52| tax collection through the tax assessor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=352)|
| 0:05:54| record keeping through the county clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=354)|
| 0:05:57| And so, therefore, the counties were largely| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=357)|
| 0:06:00| at the state General Assembly's mercy also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=360)|
| 0:06:05| So why would the General Assembly get involved in these things?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=365)|
| 0:06:08| Well, many of these private acts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=368)|
| 0:06:11| appear to have been generated by local political conflict.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=371)|
| 0:06:15| Klaus Witz liked to say that war is the continuation of policy by other means.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=375)|
| 0:06:20| Well, these private acts were often continuation of local policy wars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=380)|
| 0:06:25| by other means, i.e. through their legislative delegations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=385)|
| 0:06:30| But as cities and counties grew,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=390)|
| 0:06:34| this type of legislative interference became increasingly untenable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=394)|
| 0:06:39| Not only were these local bills disrupting the normal function of government,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=399)|
| 0:06:45| but also the cities needed the ability to respond to new urban challenges| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=405)|
| 0:06:51| without having to go back to the state for permission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=411)|
| 0:06:55| And the faster growing counties were becoming more like cities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=415)|
| 0:06:59| dealing with planning, zoning, public health,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=419)|
| 0:07:02| and they likewise needed more autonomy and flexibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=422)|
| 0:07:06| So this all came to a head in 1953,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=426)|
| 0:07:10| when the state had its first constitutional convention since 1870.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=430)|
| 0:07:15| And while the 53 Convention considered several issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=435)|
| 0:07:18| that lengthened the governor's term from two to four years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=438)|
| 0:07:21| that abolished the poll tax,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=441)|
| 0:07:23| the driving force behind that convention was home rule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=443)|
| 0:07:28| And the convention drafted and passed eight amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=448)|
| 0:07:34| Three of those amendments were to Article 11, Section 9| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=454)|
| 0:07:37| of the Tennessee Constitution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=457)|
| 0:07:39| and are collectively known as the Home Rule Amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=459)|
| 0:07:43| So let me go through those quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=463)|
| 0:07:46| First, there's the Home Rule for Municipalities Clause.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=466)|
| 0:07:51| That was Amendment 7.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=471)|
| 0:07:53| It related to optional home rule for cities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=473)|
| 0:07:56| and it created a constitutional right for a city like Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=476)|
| 0:08:01| to adopt and amend its own charter of government| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=481)|
| 0:08:04| without going through the General Assembly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=484)|
| 0:08:07| Then there was the Consolidation Clause.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=487)|
| 0:08:10| That was Amendment 8,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=490)|
| 0:08:12| related to consolidation of city and county functions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=492)|
| 0:08:15| which led to the creation of the Metropolitan Government| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=495)|
| 0:08:18| of Nashville and Davidson County in 1963.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=498)|
| 0:08:23| And then there was what is the heart of the Home Rule Amendments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=503)|
| 0:08:29| the Local Legislation Clause.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=509)|
| 0:08:32| It's the provision that has generated the most amendment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=512)|
| 0:08:35| excuse me, the most litigation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=515)|
| 0:08:37| It's Amendment 6 from the convention,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=517)|
| 0:08:40| and it relates to home rule for cities and counties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=520)|
| 0:08:44| as to local legislation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=524)|
| 0:08:48| And that clause has two parts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=528)|
| 0:08:51| The first part absolutely prohibits so-called ripper bills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=531)|
| 0:08:56| Now, that's not my term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=536)|
| 0:08:58| That's the term that the delegates to the 1953 convention talked about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=538)|
| 0:09:02| It basically removed the General Assembly's power| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=542)|
| 0:09:05| to pass any legislation that removes an incumbent from local office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=545)|
| 0:09:11| abridges the incumbent's term,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=551)|
| 0:09:13| or alters the incumbent's salary prior to the end of the term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=553)|
| 0:09:18| So that's just an absolute prohibition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=558)|
| 0:09:20| Can't do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=560)|
| 0:09:22| The second part addressed all other local bills,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=562)|
| 0:09:26| and it says that any local bill applicable to a particular city or county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=566)|
| 0:09:32| in its governmental or proprietary capacity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=572)|
| 0:09:35| which essentially means any capacity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=575)|
| 0:09:38| must be approved by the affected jurisdiction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=578)|
| 0:09:42| either by voter referendum or by the local legislative body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=582)|
| 0:09:47| If there is no such local approval in the bill,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=587)|
| 0:09:51| then the bill is void.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=591)|
| 0:09:54| Now, it's no exaggeration to call the 1953 Home Rule Amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=594)|
| 0:09:58| a revolution in Tennessee governance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=598)|
| 0:10:01| And the Tennessee Supreme Court makes two key points about that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=601)|
| 0:10:05| in a 2001 opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=605)|
| 0:10:08| The court recognizes that, first,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=608)|
| 0:10:10| quote, the whole purpose of the Home Rule Amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=610)|
| 0:10:13| was to vest control of local affairs and local government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=613)|
| 0:10:18| And it explains that this local control exists| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=618)|
| 0:10:21| because cities and counties now, quote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=621)|
| 0:10:23| derive their power from sources| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=623)|
| 0:10:25| other than the prerogative of the legislature,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=625)|
| 0:10:28| i.e., they derive that authority from the Constitution itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=628)|
| 0:10:33| Now, it's important to note here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=633)|
| 0:10:36| that while the Home Rule Amendment gives local governments more autonomy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=636)|
| 0:10:40| it does not make them independent of the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=640)|
| 0:10:43| The delegates to the 1953 convention were very clear on this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=643)|
| 0:10:47| Even after the adoption of the Home Rule Amendment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=647)|
| 0:10:50| local governments remain subject to laws of general application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=650)|
| 0:10:56| Now, litigation under the local legislative clause| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=656)|
| 0:10:58| began almost immediately after its adoption.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=658)|
| 0:11:01| And cases went to the Tennessee Supreme Court| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=661)|
| 0:11:04| fairly regularly through the 1970s,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=664)|
| 0:11:07| but really became pretty rare after the early 1990s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=667)|
| 0:11:12| Now, this is a gross generalization,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=672)|
| 0:11:15| but this initial wave of local legislation clause cases| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=675)|
| 0:11:20| kind of like what was going on before Home Rule Amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=680)|
| 0:11:24| mostly arose because of political disagreements at the local level,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=684)|
| 0:11:28| such as a lawsuit invoking the Home Rule Amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=688)|
| 0:11:31| regarding the hospital authority in Chattanooga-Hamilton County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=691)|
| 0:11:35| or expanding the authority of General Sessions' judges in Gibson County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=695)|
| 0:11:39| to alleviate a state court backlog.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=699)|
| 0:11:42| These were not political disagreements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=702)|
| 0:11:44| These were local issues, not political disagreements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=704)|
| 0:11:47| between local government and the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=707)|
| 0:11:50| But that is not the case today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=710)|
| 0:11:53| Now it's political differences between the state and local governments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=713)|
| 0:11:57| that are driving legislation and, therefore, this litigation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=717)|
| 0:12:02| Now, those differences did not initially implicate the Home Rule Amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=722)|
| 0:12:07| because the bills, on the whole, were drafted as general legislation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=727)|
| 0:12:11| that applied statewide,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=731)|
| 0:12:13| even if the bill was motivated by what a particular city had done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=733)|
| 0:12:17| And we've seen this sort of statewide preemption of local ordinances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=737)|
| 0:12:22| dealing with minimum wage or discrimination in contracting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=742)|
| 0:12:26| or municipal broadband, those sorts of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=746)|
| 0:12:29| But, and Director Dietz will talk more about this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=749)|
| 0:12:35| the bills that were passed earlier this year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=755)|
| 0:12:39| the Metro Council and to Metro government in Nashville, Metro boards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=759)|
| 0:12:44| It is hard to argue that they were anything but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=764)|
| 0:12:48| targeted specifically at Metro Nashville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=768)|
| 0:12:51| Now, as I said, I'm not going to get into the particulars of the litigation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=771)|
| 0:12:55| Director Dietz can bring this group up to speed on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=775)|
| 0:12:59| But I will note that in this area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=779)|
| 0:13:02| because of the Home Rule Amendment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=782)|
| 0:13:05| the General Assembly has to walk a narrow line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=785)|
| 0:13:09| If the General Assembly passes a local bill| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=789)|
| 0:13:12| that targets a particular city or county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=792)|
| 0:13:15| then the Home Rule Amendment, as I said, requires local approval,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=795)|
| 0:13:19| which is unlikely to happen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=799)|
| 0:13:22| with the sorts of bills that we're talking about today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=802)|
| 0:13:25| But if the General Assembly tries to expand the bill| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=805)|
| 0:13:28| into an act of general application,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=808)|
| 0:13:31| then obviously it affects people across the state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=811)|
| 0:13:34| and is likely to be harder to pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=814)|
| 0:13:37| So the challenge for the General Assembly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=817)|
| 0:13:40| is how to draft a bill that looks enough like a public act| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=820)|
| 0:13:44| to pass Home Rule Amendment muster| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=824)|
| 0:13:47| while still applying to just the targeted jurisdiction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=827)|
| 0:13:51| And as we've seen with the results| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=831)|
| 0:13:54| of some of the cases that have been brought in Davidson County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=834)|
| 0:13:57| that is not an easy task for them to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=837)|
| 0:14:00| So let me stop there and turn this over to Director Dietz,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=840)|
| 0:14:05| who is going to give an update| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=845)|
| 0:14:08| on what some of these cases coming out of Nashville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=848)|
| 0:14:11| what has been going on with those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=851)|
| 0:14:14| General Cooper, thank you so much for your presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=854)|
| 0:14:17| Director Dietz, I know you're joining us remotely,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=857)|
| 0:14:21| and we appreciate your presence with us this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=861)|
| 0:14:24| Thank you very much,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=864)|
| 0:14:27| and we're very much so looking forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=867)|
| 0:14:29| to your presentation as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=869)|
| 0:14:32| Thank you, Mr. Vice Mayor and members of the council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=872)|
| 0:14:35| First, let me apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=875)|
| 0:14:37| It was until 1115 this morning Central Time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=877)|
| 0:14:42| My plan and intent to be there with you in person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=882)|
| 0:14:46| And then the mayor called me into his office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=886)|
| 0:14:49| and he had a different plan for me today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=889)|
| 0:14:52| So I needed to be here for a two o'clock meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=892)|
| 0:14:58| that he was holding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=898)|
| 0:14:59| And so I apologize that I'm not there in person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=899)|
| 0:15:02| I fully expect it to be, but it's just the way it goes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=902)|
| 0:15:06| And I'm sure you can all understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=906)|
| 0:15:08| But I appreciate your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=908)|
| 0:15:10| Appreciate your interest in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=910)|
| 0:15:13| As my good friend Bob Cooper has said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=913)|
| 0:15:17| these are fundamental constitutional issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=917)|
| 0:15:21| The way I look at this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=921)|
| 0:15:24| what happened in the legislative session,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=924)|
| 0:15:27| not the special session,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=927)|
| 0:15:28| but the main session in the first four months of 2023,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=928)|
| 0:15:35| we saw an unprecedented level of attack on one local government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=935)|
| 0:15:42| And I don't want to get into the politics of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=942)|
| 0:15:45| because I don't view this as a Democratic or Republican issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=945)|
| 0:15:48| or a political issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=948)|
| 0:15:50| I view it as an issue of local control| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=950)|
| 0:15:53| and a matter of fundamental constitutional rights| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=953)|
| 0:15:57| that local governments have not to be micromanaged| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=957)|
| 0:16:02| by the legislature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=962)|
| 0:16:05| So the legislature passed a number of bills targeting Nashville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=965)|
| 0:16:12| And so we have filed suit over four of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=972)|
| 0:16:20| There was one bill where they appointed some state officials| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=980)|
| 0:16:25| as ex-officio members of our convention center board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=985)|
| 0:16:30| We did not oppose that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=990)|
| 0:16:32| In fact, we welcomed having the comptroller| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=992)|
| 0:16:35| and some other state officials on that board as ex-officio members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=995)|
| 0:16:39| We're looking for that kind of relationship with the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=999)|
| 0:16:42| But there were four bills that were enacted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=1002)|
| 0:16:46| that we strongly believed were targeted solely at Nashville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=1006)|
| 0:16:51| and violated our constitutional rights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=1011)|
| 0:16:55| The first one was directed to the Metro Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=1015)|
| 0:16:59| Our Metropolitan Council has 40 members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=1019)|
| 0:17:02| It's one of the largest in the country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=1022)|
| 0:17:05| There are 35 district members and five at-large members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=1025)|
| 0:17:10| It's a large council, and it's subject to legitimate debate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=1030)|
| 0:17:14| whether or not the council is too large.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=1034)|
| 0:17:16| But we believe that issue should be decided| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=1036)|
| 0:17:19| by the voters of Nashville, not by legislators| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=1039)|
| 0:17:22| from far-flung areas of the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=1042)|
| 0:17:26| Well, the legislature adopted a bill that required,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=1046)|
| 0:17:32| and the way they defined it, it only applied to Nashville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=1052)|
| 0:17:36| They required a bill that required Metro| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=1056)|
| 0:17:39| to reduce the size of its council from 40 to 20| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=1059)|
| 0:17:44| and to do so immediately,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=1064)|
| 0:17:46| even though we were in an election that had already started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=1066)|
| 0:17:52| We had candidates for council who had filed qualifying papers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=1072)|
| 0:17:58| had appointed treasurers, had started to raise money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=1078)|
| 0:18:02| and, in fact, were campaigning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=1082)|
| 0:18:05| And the general, this is a nonpartisan race.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=1085)|
| 0:18:13| The general election was in August,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=1093)|
| 0:18:15| and any district where there needed to be a runoff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=1095)|
| 0:18:21| or at-large, the runoff was September 14th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=1101)|
| 0:18:25| And so we argued, we filed a lawsuit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=1105)|
| 0:18:29| saying that this violated the Home Rule Amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=1109)|
| 0:18:32| because it targeted only Nashville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=1112)|
| 0:18:35| and was intended to target only Nashville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=1115)|
| 0:18:38| It could not apply to any other local government,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=1118)|
| 0:18:42| and we asked the court for a temporary injunction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=1122)|
| 0:18:48| As you may know, a few years ago, the legislature,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=1128)|
| 0:18:54| in particular with cases that were brought by Nashville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=1134)|
| 0:18:57| and heard by Nashville chancellors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=1137)|
| 0:18:59| they didn't like the opinions that were coming out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=1139)|
| 0:19:02| So the legislature changed the law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=1142)|
| 0:19:04| so that if we or anybody else,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=1144)|
| 0:19:07| if we challenge an act of the legislature| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=1147)|
| 0:19:09| based on constitutional grounds, Tennessee constitutional grounds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=1149)|
| 0:19:14| it goes in front.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=1154)|
| 0:19:15| We file in Chancery Court in Davidson County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=1155)|
| 0:19:18| and we get a chancellor by random draw.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=1158)|
| 0:19:20| And then the Supreme Court appoints two additional judges,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=1160)|
| 0:19:25| one from East Tennessee, one from West Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=1165)|
| 0:19:28| And so we went in front of this three-judge panel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=1168)|
| 0:19:31| with a local chancellor plus two judges| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=1171)|
| 0:19:34| from East and West Tennessee, respectively,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=1174)|
| 0:19:37| and we argued our case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=1177)|
| 0:19:39| And we very promptly got a ruling, three to zero,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=1179)|
| 0:19:44| that as applied to this year's election,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=1184)|
| 0:19:47| the bill was unconstitutional.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=1187)|
| 0:19:49| It violated the Home Rule Amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=1189)|
| 0:19:51| to the Tennessee Constitution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=1191)|
| 0:19:54| The court did reserve the issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=1194)|
| 0:19:56| of whether it could apply going forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=1196)|
| 0:19:59| And only one judge would have ruled immediately| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=1199)|
| 0:20:04| that going forward for the next elections,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=1204)|
| 0:20:07| which will be 2027, it could not apply.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=1207)|
| 0:20:10| But we are going to argue that issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=1210)|
| 0:20:15| with cross motions for summary judgment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=1215)|
| 0:20:17| that will be heard in, I've forgotten,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=1217)|
| 0:20:20| it's April or May of next year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=1220)|
| 0:20:23| which will give us a chance to get a ruling| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=1223)|
| 0:20:25| and have a final decision in plenty of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=1225)|
| 0:20:28| We are optimistic that we will ultimately prevail| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=1228)|
| 0:20:32| on that part as well for the prospective application| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=1232)|
| 0:20:37| of that statute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=1237)|
| 0:20:40| So we won, we had an election this summer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=1240)|
| 0:20:43| where 40 council members were elected| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=1243)|
| 0:20:47| and they had their first meeting on October 3rd| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=1247)|
| 0:20:53| and they're meeting in due course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=1253)|
| 0:20:56| Now, the second lawsuit that we filed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=1256)|
| 0:21:02| was based on the legislature passed a bill| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=1262)|
| 0:21:11| that simply amended our charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=1271)|
| 0:21:13| It's almost like they pulled our charter up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=1273)|
| 0:21:16| and did track changes to our charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=1276)|
| 0:21:19| This goes back to 10, 12 years ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=1279)|
| 0:21:22| when there was a Save Our Fairgrounds movement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=1282)|
| 0:21:25| in Nashville where people were concerned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=1285)|
| 0:21:28| about losing the state fair and the flea markets| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=1288)|
| 0:21:31| and the stock car racing that was going on saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=1291)|
| 0:21:36| we want to preserve all that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=1296)|
| 0:21:38| And so they proposed the Save Our Fairgrounds amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=1298)|
| 0:21:42| to our charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=1302)|
| 0:21:44| There was a referendum and it passed overwhelmingly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=1304)|
| 0:21:48| And what that amendment did was to require| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=1308)|
| 0:21:51| any coordinates that called for the destruction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=1311)|
| 0:21:55| of any part of the fairgrounds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=1315)|
| 0:21:58| instead of just needing a simple majority,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=1318)|
| 0:22:00| 21 votes out of 40,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=1320)|
| 0:22:03| it required a super majority of 27 votes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=1323)|
| 0:22:07| And in the background,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=1327)|
| 0:22:09| what was happening was Bristol Motor Speedway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=1329)|
| 0:22:12| was coming in with a proposal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=1332)|
| 0:22:14| to bring more NASCAR racing to Nashville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=1334)|
| 0:22:18| They needed to destroy the grandstand,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=1338)|
| 0:22:20| the historic grandstand around the racetrack.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=1340)|
| 0:22:24| And they realized they could not get 27 votes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=1344)|
| 0:22:28| for their proposal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=1348)|
| 0:22:29| which they hoped to get through the council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=1349)|
| 0:22:33| the old council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=1353)|
| 0:22:34| which had its last meeting on August 15th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=1354)|
| 0:22:38| So they're up against this super majority| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=1358)|
| 0:22:41| and don't think they have to vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=1361)|
| 0:22:43| So they went to their legislators,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=1363)|
| 0:22:46| the state representative from Bristol,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=1366)|
| 0:22:48| the state senator from Bristol and said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=1368)|
| 0:22:50| hey, we want you to do this amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=1370)|
| 0:22:52| And the amendment impacted metropolitan governments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=1372)|
| 0:22:58| with population of certain sizes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=1378)|
| 0:23:02| And essentially it only impacted Nashville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=1382)|
| 0:23:06| This was a unique charter provision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=1386)|
| 0:23:08| I'm sure you don't have a charter provision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=1388)|
| 0:23:11| that talks about demolition of fairgrounds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=1391)|
| 0:23:14| or any other Knoxville owned property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=1394)|
| 0:23:19| It only applied to Nashville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=1399)|
| 0:23:21| And so we, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=1401)|
| 0:23:23| filed suit said you're violating the home rule amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=1403)|
| 0:23:27| We get a three judge panel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=1407)|
| 0:23:29| And once again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=1409)|
| 0:23:30| we get a ruling three to zero in our favor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=1410)|
| 0:23:35| The state did not appeal that ruling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=1415)|
| 0:23:38| The state did not appeal the ruling| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=1418)|
| 0:23:40| on the Metro council as it applied to this year's election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=1420)|
| 0:23:44| So those,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=1424)|
| 0:23:45| so part of the council case is over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=1425)|
| 0:23:48| The fairgrounds case is over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=1428)|
| 0:23:51| We won three to zero.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=1431)|
| 0:23:54| The third case was our lawsuit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=1434)|
| 0:23:58| It's been a very busy year for Metro legal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=1438)|
| 0:24:01| And frankly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=1441)|
| 0:24:02| we've had general Cooper helping us every step of the way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=1442)|
| 0:24:05| And so our third lawsuit was when the state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=1445)|
| 0:24:09| actually stole our airport authority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=1449)|
| 0:24:14| In 1969 or 70,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=1454)|
| 0:24:16| the state passed enabling legislation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=1456)|
| 0:24:19| encouraging local governments to create airport authorities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=1459)|
| 0:24:25| to run their airports.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=1465)|
| 0:24:26| And the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=1466)|
| 0:24:27| and the thought process at the time was airports were critical to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=1467)|
| 0:24:31| economic development and they needed to be run professionally and not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=1471)|
| 0:24:36| not be subject to political whims or,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=1476)|
| 0:24:38| you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=1478)|
| 0:24:39| who's in may who's the mayor who's in charge to create an independent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=1479)|
| 0:24:43| business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=1483)|
| 0:24:44| like authority to run the airport.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=1484)|
| 0:24:46| And so like many local governments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=1486)|
| 0:24:51| we Metro created the metropolitan national airport authority under| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=1491)|
| 0:24:57| state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=1497)|
| 0:24:59| Our authority is an instrumentality,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=1499)|
| 0:25:03| an agency and instrumentality of the metropolitan government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=1503)|
| 0:25:07| It's ours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=1507)|
| 0:25:08| We own it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=1508)|
| 0:25:09| We control it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=1509)|
| 0:25:10| And under state law,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=1510)|
| 0:25:11| the mayor appointed all of the board members subject to approval by the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=1511)|
| 0:25:16| Metro council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=1516)|
| 0:25:18| Well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=1518)|
| 0:25:19| the state came in and said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=1519)|
| 0:25:20| no,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=1520)|
| 0:25:21| we're going,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=1521)|
| 0:25:22| we're going to take over your board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=1522)|
| 0:25:23| We're going to vacate your board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=1523)|
| 0:25:25| They're out of office as of July one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=1525)|
| 0:25:27| And we are going to install an eight member board where the government| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=1527)|
| 0:25:33| gets two appointments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=1533)|
| 0:25:34| The governor gets two appointments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=1534)|
| 0:25:35| The lieutenant governor gets two appointments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=1535)|
| 0:25:37| Speaker of the house gets two appointments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=1537)|
| 0:25:39| And the metropolitan national mayor gets to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=1539)|
| 0:25:43| They took over control of the board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=1543)|
| 0:25:45| which under government accounting rules,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=1545)|
| 0:25:48| literally means instead of it being a component unit of the metropolitan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=1548)|
| 0:25:53| government of Nashville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=1553)|
| 0:25:55| it became a component unit of the state of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=1555)|
| 0:25:58| They literally stole our airport.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=1558)|
| 0:26:00| And so we,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=1560)|
| 0:26:02| and it did not apply to any other local government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=1562)|
| 0:26:06| And so we argued again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=1566)|
| 0:26:08| home rule amendment and,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=1568)|
| 0:26:10| and we added arguments under the equal protection clauses of the Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=1570)|
| 0:26:15| constitution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=1575)|
| 0:26:16| which are very similar to the equal protection clause arguments you would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=1576)|
| 0:26:20| see under the 14th amendment to the U S constitution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=1580)|
| 0:26:22| So once again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=1582)|
| 0:26:24| three judge panel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=1584)|
| 0:26:26| we argued cross motions for summary judgment on October the sixth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=1586)|
| 0:26:31| And on Halloween afternoon,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=1591)|
| 0:26:34| about four o'clock we get an opinion unanimous again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=1594)|
| 0:26:39| three to zero in our favor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=1599)|
| 0:26:42| in our favor saying this bill,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=1602)|
| 0:26:47| this bill violated the local legislation clause of the home world| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=1607)|
| 0:26:51| amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=1611)|
| 0:26:52| It violated the ripper bill of the home world amendment because it ripped| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=1612)|
| 0:26:56| our appointees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=1616)|
| 0:26:57| our officials out of office and violated the equal protection clause.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=1617)|
| 0:27:02| So we had three judges across the board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=1622)|
| 0:27:05| unanimously agree with all three of our arguments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=1625)|
| 0:27:08| And so the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=1628)|
| 0:27:10| so as of this Monday of this week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=1630)|
| 0:27:14| our board was back in place after being an exile for four months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=1634)|
| 0:27:20| And they're now beginning the process of figuring out what happened in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=1640)|
| 0:27:24| prior four months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=1644)|
| 0:27:26| It's unclear what the state will do with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=1646)|
| 0:27:29| Their deadline to appeal does not run until November 30th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=1649)|
| 0:27:34| So they have plenty of time to file an appeal if they choose to do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=1654)|
| 0:27:40| But we're hopeful that even if they do appeal that the appellate court and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=1660)|
| 0:27:46| potentially the Supreme court, we'll see how strong this opinion was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=1666)|
| 0:27:51| 34 pages approved by judges across the state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=1671)|
| 0:27:56| unanimously. And one thing I want,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=1676)|
| 0:27:59| I want to point out is that in these three cases that we have won| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=1679)|
| 0:28:04| unanimously,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=1684)|
| 0:28:07| the chancellor from Metropolitan Nashville runs as a Democrat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=1687)|
| 0:28:13| And so we had a chancellor from Nashville who was a Democrat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=1693)|
| 0:28:17| In each case,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=1697)|
| 0:28:19| the other two judges were appointees of Republican governors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=1699)|
| 0:28:24| And so if you're counting political judges,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=1704)|
| 0:28:28| and I don't do that because I,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=1708)|
| 0:28:30| I believe nine out of 10 judges or more,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=1710)|
| 0:28:33| once they put on that black robe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=1713)|
| 0:28:35| they don't really look at politics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=1715)|
| 0:28:38| They do their very best to follow the law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=1718)|
| 0:28:42| I just trust our judges to do their very best to follow the law,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=1722)|
| 0:28:47| regardless of their political leanings one way or another.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=1727)|
| 0:28:51| And so, so that's giving us some hope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=1731)|
| 0:28:55| If we do get to the court of appeals or even the Supreme court,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=1735)|
| 0:29:00| because we have bipartisan panels with judges from across the state,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=1740)|
| 0:29:06| highly esteemed judges,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=1746)|
| 0:29:07| these in fact are judges picked by the Supreme court to sit on this panel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=1747)|
| 0:29:11| for this important case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=1751)|
| 0:29:12| We're hopeful that we will prevail on the appeal. The last case we filed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=1752)|
| 0:29:16| The fourth case is a case where with our sports authority,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=1756)|
| 0:29:23| which owns the Titan stadium,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=1763)|
| 0:29:26| our AAA baseball stadium, our new soccer stadium,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=1766)|
| 0:29:32| which is the largest single purpose soccer stadium in the country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=1772)|
| 0:29:37| And Bridgestone arena where the predators play.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=1777)|
| 0:29:40| So our sports authority has been very active and very successful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=1780)|
| 0:29:44| They,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=1784)|
| 0:29:45| they passed the law that will go into effect if we do not win this motion for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=1785)|
| 0:29:50| an injunction on January 1st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=1790)|
| 0:29:53| And with our 13 member sports authority,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=1793)|
| 0:29:56| they vacate the entire board and say the state will appoint six of the 13.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=1796)|
| 0:30:04| And then seven members of the existing board will be reappointed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=1804)|
| 0:30:09| but through the statute, they pick which ones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=1809)|
| 0:30:13| So they are vacating the entire board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=1813)|
| 0:30:17| And even though they're reappointing seven members that were on the board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=1817)|
| 0:30:20| we appointed, they don't give us the chance to say, okay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=1820)|
| 0:30:24| if we only have seven seats, here's who we want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=1824)|
| 0:30:27| They picked by virtue of tenure, who's going to be on that authority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=1827)|
| 0:30:33| So we are in the midst of our briefing on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=1833)|
| 0:30:39| We have our argument on our motion for temporary injunction on November 29th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=1839)|
| 0:30:45| And we are going to encourage the panel to give us an opinion before January| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=1845)|
| 0:30:51| one before the board changes over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=1851)|
| 0:30:55| So we think we're very optimistic because we've won these arguments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=1855)|
| 0:31:02| three to zero now in three different cases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=1862)|
| 0:31:05| And for me, every time I talk to the media, I talk about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=1865)|
| 0:31:14| of course, we're grateful for the courts and that we are winning these cases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=1874)|
| 0:31:17| But the main thing is we want the state legislature to understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=1877)|
| 0:31:22| what the constitutional limits are so that they cannot decide to come in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=1882)|
| 0:31:26| and tell Metro Nashville or the city of Knoxville or Knox County or whoever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=1886)|
| 0:31:33| how to run their local government and pass laws that apply only| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=1893)|
| 0:31:37| to that local government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=1897)|
| 0:31:40| So we're hopeful that the relationships are being recalibrated where,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=1900)|
| 0:31:46| frankly, they respect us because it was clear in this last session,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=1906)|
| 0:31:51| they just didn't respect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=1911)|
| 0:31:53| They didn't want to hear what we had to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=1913)|
| 0:31:56| They were upset with us and and they just wanted to do things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=1916)|
| 0:32:01| to target Nashville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=1921)|
| 0:32:02| So in any event, we've been really, really grateful that the courts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=1922)|
| 0:32:08| have paid attention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=1928)|
| 0:32:10| Very encouraged that we have won three cases now unanimously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=1930)|
| 0:32:15| We're hopeful on the sports authority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=1935)|
| 0:32:18| One footnote, like like Knoxville, we have we had a community oversight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=1938)|
| 0:32:25| board and the state law changed the powers and the composition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=1945)|
| 0:32:30| of those boards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=1950)|
| 0:32:32| But the state law applied to Nashville, Memphis, Chattanooga, Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=1952)|
| 0:32:39| all of whom had boards and it applied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=1959)|
| 0:32:43| Respectively, so we chose not to file a lawsuit over that because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=1963)|
| 0:32:48| we did not believe we could meet the guidelines outlined in the case| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=1968)|
| 0:32:52| law that Bob Cooper just described.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=1972)|
| 0:32:55| So we chose not to litigate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=1975)|
| 0:32:58| And I got some severe criticism from supporters of the COB, but we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=1978)|
| 0:33:05| going to be very careful in what lawsuits we file and file lawsuits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=1985)|
| 0:33:09| only if we strongly believe we are right on the constitutional law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=1989)|
| 0:33:16| So I'm sorry for taking so much time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=1996)|
| 0:33:19| But we are hopeful that we'll keep these wins on appeal if the state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=1999)|
| 0:33:25| does appeal and hopeful that the legislature going forward will not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=2005)|
| 0:33:31| do some of the things they did to us this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=2011)|
| 0:33:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=2014)|
| 0:33:35| Thank you, Director Dietz.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=2015)|
| 0:33:37| We really appreciate your participation remotely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=2017)|
| 0:33:41| We understand being called away and having something you have to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=2021)|
| 0:33:44| handle. So that is that is understandable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=2024)|
| 0:33:47| But we do appreciate your time and discussing what's going on in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=2027)|
| 0:33:51| Nashville today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=2031)|
| 0:33:53| Miss Wynn, welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=2033)|
| 0:33:56| We are really looking forward to your presentation this evening as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=2036)|
| 0:33:59| well. Thank you for traveling to visit with us today and taking time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=2039)|
| 0:34:04| out of your day and your week to come visit with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=2044)|
| 0:34:07| I'll turn it over to you now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=2047)|
| 0:34:08| We're all very interested in your presentation as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=2048)|
| 0:34:10| Thank you for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=2050)|
| 0:34:12| Thank you, Mr. Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=2052)|
| 0:34:13| Members of the Knox County Council, I am honored to be here with my| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=2053)|
| 0:34:18| good friend Bob and with Wally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=2058)|
| 0:34:21| And I'm here because of a presentation these guys did on a call I was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=2061)|
| 0:34:26| on. I serve as a Davidson County clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=2066)|
| 0:34:30| And let me open my comments by saying that most, if not all, of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=2070)|
| 0:34:35| work that I do every day in my line of work is dependent on our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=2075)|
| 0:34:40| Tennessee General Assembly and the legislation that they pass enabling| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=2080)|
| 0:34:44| me to do this work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=2084)|
| 0:34:46| So I respect what they do most of the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=2086)|
| 0:34:50| But in the instance of the legislation that was passed impacting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=2090)|
| 0:34:56| Nashville, I couldn't sit by and and not at least stand up for what I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=2096)|
| 0:35:03| believed in as a citizen of the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=2103)|
| 0:35:06| I'm an elected official, but I've also lived in Nashville most of my| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=2106)|
| 0:35:10| life. I was in the city of Nashville when we became a metropolitan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=2110)|
| 0:35:15| form of government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=2115)|
| 0:35:16| I recall the history that caused our charter to be created.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=2116)|
| 0:35:22| The charter that called for us to have 40 members on the city council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=2122)|
| 0:35:26| and the fact that it didn't pass immediately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=2126)|
| 0:35:29| It took several votes for us to get to the place where we chose the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=2129)|
| 0:35:33| size of our council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=2133)|
| 0:35:34| And what we wanted at that time, people in the community, was a council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=2134)|
| 0:35:39| that reflected who Nashville was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=2139)|
| 0:35:42| We chose 40 members because we wanted to have representatives on our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=2142)|
| 0:35:47| city council who look like us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=2147)|
| 0:35:50| So when I heard the presentation from Wally and Bob about the fact that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=2150)|
| 0:35:55| there was talk to reduce our city council down to 20, I'd already been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=2155)|
| 0:36:01| following the legislation, been listening, and was pretty upset.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=2161)|
| 0:36:05| But that call gave me the opportunity to stand up and to speak out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=2165)|
| 0:36:11| And that's the thing, as a citizen, I just believe that we have to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=2171)|
| 0:36:15| always stand for what's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=2175)|
| 0:36:17| The citizens in Nashville had voted at least one or two times on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=2177)|
| 0:36:22| sides of our city council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=2182)|
| 0:36:23| We had decided that we wanted our council to remain a 40-member council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=2183)|
| 0:36:29| So having it reduced to 20 was going to impact us, I believe, in a way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=2189)|
| 0:36:35| that was not going to be beneficial to average everyday citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=2195)|
| 0:36:39| When I think about what it costs to run an election these days, you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=2199)|
| 0:36:43| don't run elections on pennies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=2203)|
| 0:36:45| You need money to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=2205)|
| 0:36:47| And so I believed wholeheartedly that had our council been reduced to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=2207)|
| 0:36:52| 20 citizens, average everyday citizens, neighborhood advocates that I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=2212)|
| 0:36:57| had worked with over the years were not going to get elected to those offices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=2217)|
| 0:37:01| It was going to be individuals who had the backing of the business community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=2221)|
| 0:37:06| So I stand up and I speak out against the legislation that was passed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=2226)|
| 0:37:12| targeting Nashville, mainly because of the city council legislation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=2232)|
| 0:37:19| remembering that at that time, at the time that that legislation was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=2239)|
| 0:37:23| passed, we in Nashville were going to be celebrating 60 years as a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=2243)|
| 0:37:28| metropolitan form of government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=2248)|
| 0:37:30| But what we were also going to be doing, had that legislation been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=2250)|
| 0:37:34| successful, was watching that state legislature roll back 60 years of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=2254)|
| 0:37:41| civil rights gains.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=2261)|
| 0:37:42| And I just believe that it was important for me as a citizen to stand up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=2262)|
| 0:37:47| and speak out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=2267)|
| 0:37:48| Thank you for letting me share that with you today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=2268)|
| 0:37:51| And Bob and Wally, thank you for what you guys do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=2271)|
| 0:37:54| Thank you for all that you do to serve this public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=2274)|
| 0:37:57| Thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=2277)|
| 0:37:59| That ends our presentations this evening, council members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=2279)|
| 0:38:04| It's now time for council questions and discussions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=2284)|
| 0:38:07| I wanted to remind my colleagues that our guests today are not familiar| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=2287)|
| 0:38:16| with anything that is directly occurring in Knoxville or may occur in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=2296)|
| 0:38:20| Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=2300)|
| 0:38:21| They are here to talk to us in general about what Home Rule is and what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=2301)|
| 0:38:25| their experience has been in Nashville over some of the legal cases that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=2305)|
| 0:38:30| they've been involved in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=2310)|
| 0:38:31| So we certainly welcome them being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=2311)|
| 0:38:33| But please try to keep your questions to a general discussion about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=2313)|
| 0:38:37| Home Rule and not specifics, because they won't be able to share any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=2317)|
| 0:38:40| answers or insight with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=2320)|
| 0:38:44| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=2324)|
| 0:38:45| Do we have any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=2325)|
| 0:38:50| Council Member Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=2330)|
| 0:38:53| I'm trying to think generally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=2333)|
| 0:38:54| Sorry, I think we're all up here, wheels spinning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=2334)|
| 0:38:57| Trying to stay within the bounds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=2337)|
| 0:39:02| I'll direct this to Mr. Dietz or Mr. Cooper, maybe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=2342)|
| 0:39:09| But, Ms. Wynn, you also may have comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=2349)|
| 0:39:11| I don't know who the correct person would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=2351)|
| 0:39:16| How many active litigation cases are there right now regarding Home Rule?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=2356)|
| 0:39:23| It's more than one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=2363)|
| 0:39:25| You have several things that are in litigation, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=2365)|
| 0:39:30| We filed four cases coming out of this legislative session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=2370)|
| 0:39:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=2376)|
| 0:39:39| And prior to that, we had litigated the voucher case, the ESA case| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=2379)|
| 0:39:45| that applied at the time only to Nashville and Shelby County, although| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=2385)|
| 0:39:49| that litigation has now concluded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=2389)|
| 0:39:53| So active cases that we are involved in, there are four, except the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=2393)|
| 0:40:02| Fairgrounds case is over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=2402)|
| 0:40:03| We won it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=2403)|
| 0:40:04| There was no appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=2404)|
| 0:40:05| It's over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=2405)|
| 0:40:06| The Fairgrounds?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=2406)|
| 0:40:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=2407)|
| 0:40:08| The Fairgrounds case is over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=2408)|
| 0:40:10| We won three to zero.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=2410)|
| 0:40:11| They cannot amend our charter, and that case is over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=2411)|
| 0:40:15| The Metro Council case, we won the injunction as it applied, the statute| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=2415)|
| 0:40:20| applied to this year's election, and we will argue in the spring in front| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=2420)|
| 0:40:25| of that three-judge panel whether we can have the act declared void as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=2425)|
| 0:40:32| it would apply to the elections in 2027.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=2432)|
| 0:40:36| So that case is still open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=2436)|
| 0:40:38| That one's open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=2438)|
| 0:40:40| The Metro Nashville Airport Authority, which we just won on October| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=2440)|
| 0:40:44| 31st, three to nothing, it is now subject to an appeal, and we'll know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=2444)|
| 0:40:50| by November 30th whether the state appeals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=2450)|
| 0:40:53| So that case is still open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=2453)|
| 0:40:55| The third case is the Sports Authority case, which is being argued on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=2455)|
| 0:41:00| November 29th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=2460)|
| 0:41:02| So we have one case, which we won, is over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=2462)|
| 0:41:07| The second case we won for this year, but the rest of it is still up in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=2467)|
| 0:41:11| there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=2471)|
| 0:41:12| So that's a partial victory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=2472)|
| 0:41:14| The third case we won, we could go up on appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=2474)|
| 0:41:17| The fourth case is pending before the three-judge panel on November 29th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=2477)|
| 0:41:23| So those were the four cases we filed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=2483)|
| 0:41:27| And the fairgrounds is from a previous legislative session, not in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=2487)|
| 0:41:33| current four, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=2493)|
| 0:41:35| Yeah, it was 2023.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=2495)|
| 0:41:37| What happened was Bristol Motor Speedways came in with a proposal that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=2497)|
| 0:41:41| our mayor was in favor of, and it was to renovate the fairgrounds, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=2501)|
| 0:41:48| they were hoping to have their proposal to enter into a lease for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=2508)|
| 0:41:54| Speedway portion of the Nashville fairgrounds and bring NASCAR to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=2514)|
| 0:42:04| Nashville at least once a year or every other year, and then run other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=2524)|
| 0:42:09| races through there as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=2529)|
| 0:42:12| So that was very much an active proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=2532)|
| 0:42:16| Again, they became concerned they were not going to get to the super| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=2536)|
| 0:42:20| majority threshold that the shorter amendment required.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=2540)|
| 0:42:24| So I think it was in April of this year as the legislature was getting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=2544)|
| 0:42:30| ready to go out of town, it was towards the end of the session in April| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=2550)|
| 0:42:34| they passed that law affecting the fairgrounds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=2554)|
| 0:42:37| So all of the four cases I've talked about all came out of the legislative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=2557)|
| 0:42:44| session between January and the end of April this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=2564)|
| 0:42:49| Okay, so have you, and we're on timers here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=2569)|
| 0:42:52| I don't know if you can see that or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=2572)|
| 0:42:54| We have a five-minute timer when we speak for our rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=2574)|
| 0:42:59| When, have you had other sessions in the past other than this most recent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=2579)|
| 0:43:05| one where you've had multiple or, past legislative sessions have they had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=2585)|
| 0:43:14| issues where you've had to file litigation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=2594)|
| 0:43:17| Yes, and I'll ask General Cooper to speak to some activity because he was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=2597)|
| 0:43:24| involved as law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=2604)|
| 0:43:26| He served prior to my coming in and he had litigation that he filed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=2606)|
| 0:43:33| So Bob, you want to take that one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=2613)|
| 0:43:36| No, happy to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=2616)|
| 0:43:38| So what Wally is referring to is the bill passed in 2019 which created| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=2618)|
| 0:43:46| the education savings account program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=2626)|
| 0:43:50| That bill was drafted so that it only would apply now and in the future| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=2630)|
| 0:43:58| to Davidson County and Shelby County without further amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=2638)|
| 0:44:06| And so we challenged that as a violation of the home rule amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=2646)|
| 0:44:13| The fact that a bill applies to only two counties instead of one county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=2653)|
| 0:44:17| does not exempt it from home rule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=2657)|
| 0:44:20| And we also challenged it under equal protection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=2660)|
| 0:44:23| We prevailed in the Chancery Court in Davidson County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=2663)|
| 0:44:29| That was prior to the statute that Wally's talking about that created| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=2669)|
| 0:44:33| three judge panels for constitutional challenges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=2673)|
| 0:44:37| We prevailed there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=2677)|
| 0:44:38| We also got a unanimous affirmance from the Court of Appeals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=2678)|
| 0:44:44| Then it went to the Tennessee Supreme Court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=2684)|
| 0:44:47| We actually had to argue it twice because one of the justices who had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=2687)|
| 0:44:53| heard it the initial time passed away before an opinion was issued.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=2693)|
| 0:44:59| And since the court was at that point deadlocked, then it had to be re-argued.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=2699)|
| 0:45:04| And the court 3-2 overturned the lower court decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=2704)|
| 0:45:10| Obviously we think on too narrow ground that the statute applied only to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=2710)|
| 0:45:20| local education agencies, not to the county or city that funded them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=2720)|
| 0:45:28| But that is the interpretation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=2728)|
| 0:45:31| We don't think that that applies in the cases that we have been litigating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=2731)|
| 0:45:36| And obviously the courts have agreed with us on that so far.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=2736)|
| 0:45:39| One point I would make about that ESA lawsuit and the ESA bill,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=2739)|
| 0:45:45| that bill passed by only one vote in the House of Representatives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=2745)|
| 0:45:51| And that was after several deals were cut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=2751)|
| 0:45:56| The bill initially applied to multiple jurisdictions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=2756)|
| 0:45:59| It was a bill of general application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=2759)|
| 0:46:02| But various cities and counties were exempted in order to get votes of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=2762)|
| 0:46:09| additional legislators so that it was only ultimately narrowed to those two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=2769)|
| 0:46:16| But any comfort that a legislator may have taken from having their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=2776)|
| 0:46:22| jurisdiction carved out, obviously is short term because as we know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=2782)|
| 0:46:27| there is a bill coming up in the upcoming session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=2787)|
| 0:46:30| Well, it's already been expanded to a third jurisdiction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=2790)|
| 0:46:33| And there's a bill coming up that will make it a bill of general application| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=2793)|
| 0:46:36| across the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=2796)|
| 0:46:38| To me, what that shows is the local governments really need to work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=2798)|
| 0:46:44| together from the start.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=2804)|
| 0:46:46| Don't assume that just because you get carved out initially that whatever is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=2806)|
| 0:46:50| done is not going to get expanded at some future time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=2810)|
| 0:46:55| I appreciate you guys' time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=2815)|
| 0:46:57| I'll defer to my colleagues for now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=2817)|
| 0:47:00| Council Member Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=2820)|
| 0:47:03| And thank you for your time tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=2823)|
| 0:47:05| I know you either drove here or are spending time with us tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=2825)|
| 0:47:09| It's very important for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=2829)|
| 0:47:12| It seems to me that one of the common themes of the legislation that you're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=2832)|
| 0:47:17| challenging is consolidating representation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=2837)|
| 0:47:24| meaning a less diverse representation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=2844)|
| 0:47:28| I think, Ms. Wynn, you mentioned this a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=2848)|
| 0:47:32| Could you all expand upon, you know, some of that is more obvious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=2852)|
| 0:47:38| Other aspects of that may have a ripple effect that are more nuanced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=2858)|
| 0:47:42| But can you talk about the consolidated representation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=2862)|
| 0:47:47| and the lack of diversity of representation in each of these cases| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=2867)|
| 0:47:51| and maybe some things that aren't so obvious to the eye| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=2871)|
| 0:47:54| and what impact it has on the representation of the community?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=2874)|
| 0:48:00| Again, my passion about what was happening with the reduction of the size| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=2880)|
| 0:48:06| of the council went back to why we had that size of council in the beginning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=2886)|
| 0:48:13| going back all the way to the charter that created| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=2893)|
| 0:48:16| the metropolitan form of government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=2896)|
| 0:48:19| It was votes that were passed, votes that allowed the charter to be created| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=2899)|
| 0:48:25| that included conversations with our greater community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=2905)|
| 0:48:29| about what our council would look like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=2909)|
| 0:48:32| So to have 35 council districts where you would represent people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=2912)|
| 0:48:37| from across the broader community, that's why I was disturbed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=2917)|
| 0:48:44| about the reduction of the council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=2924)|
| 0:48:46| Again, and because just a few years before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=2926)|
| 0:48:50| there had been a vote put to the citizens of Nashville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=2930)|
| 0:48:55| challenging the size of the council, asking us if we wanted it reduced,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=2935)|
| 0:49:00| and the vote was decisively that the citizens in Davidson County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=2940)|
| 0:49:06| were satisfied with the size of our council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=2946)|
| 0:49:09| and we wanted to keep it that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=2949)|
| 0:49:18| I would, Council Member, I would point out that if you're looking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=2958)|
| 0:49:22| at the airport authority legislation that was passed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=2962)|
| 0:49:26| it took the metro airport authority from a body| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=2966)|
| 0:49:31| that consisted only of residents of Davidson County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=2971)|
| 0:49:35| the county most affected by the operation of the airport authority,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=2975)|
| 0:49:40| and reduced it to where the statute only required, it could be more,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=2980)|
| 0:49:45| but the only requirement for local representation would have applied to three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=2985)|
| 0:49:51| So that could be theoretically a significant reduction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=2991)|
| 0:49:56| in the representation of, for example, people who lived close to the airport| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=2996)|
| 0:50:02| and most affected by its operation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=3002)|
| 0:50:04| much more limited availability to be on the authority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=3004)|
| 0:50:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=3008)|
| 0:50:11| Council Member Testerman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=3011)|
| 0:50:14| Thank you, Vice Mayor, and thank you all for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=3014)|
| 0:50:18| This is definitely helpful information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=3018)|
| 0:50:22| In this kind of piggybacking on Council Member Smith,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=3022)|
| 0:50:26| I'm just curious in a little bit more of a deep dive of the airport authority,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=3026)|
| 0:50:32| but also the sports authority, you know, not so, not as much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=3032)|
| 0:50:37| I'm just curious what some of the more underlying grievances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=3037)|
| 0:50:43| of the General Assembly were as it related, and if you all stated those,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=3043)|
| 0:50:49| but I didn't get it, but with the airport,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=3049)|
| 0:50:53| but also with the sports authority, again, with such, so much expansion of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=3053)|
| 0:51:00| you know, the sports in the Nashville area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=3060)|
| 0:51:07| So I'm just curious about what was it that the GA saw| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=3067)|
| 0:51:11| that really felt the need to go after these two bodies specifically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=3071)|
| 0:51:16| We're going to defer to Wally on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=3076)|
| 0:51:19| I'll take a shot at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=3079)|
| 0:51:22| So I was on the Hill when these bills were being debated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=3082)|
| 0:51:26| I was watching on my computer screen, and time after time again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=3086)|
| 0:51:33| members of the Davidson County delegation asked the bill sponsors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=3093)|
| 0:51:39| why, why are you doing this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=3099)|
| 0:51:42| What is it about our airport authority you believe you need to take it over?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=3102)|
| 0:51:48| What is your criticism?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=3108)|
| 0:51:50| And they had none.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=3110)|
| 0:51:51| They had no criticism at all of how our airport authority was operating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=3111)|
| 0:51:57| Our airport authority had a very high bond rating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=3117)|
| 0:52:01| It was growing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=3121)|
| 0:52:02| We were attracting new airlines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=3122)|
| 0:52:05| They are in the midst of a major expansion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=3125)|
| 0:52:08| They just completed a major renovation, and our delegation kept asking why,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=3128)|
| 0:52:14| and there literally was not a single criticism of the airport authority| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=3134)|
| 0:52:20| and how they were doing business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=3140)|
| 0:52:22| They said, in fact, essentially, well, you know, the airport's growing so much,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=3142)|
| 0:52:28| we just think we should be involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=3148)|
| 0:52:30| So it's almost like we're penalized for doing a good job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=3150)|
| 0:52:35| If you do a really good job, oh, well, we're going to take you over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=3155)|
| 0:52:39| It seemed counterintuitive to me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=3159)|
| 0:52:42| and that's one of the things that the court pointed out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=3162)|
| 0:52:45| was that they had no rational basis to do this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=3165)|
| 0:52:50| and that came up in the equal protection claim argument| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=3170)|
| 0:52:53| because all they had to do was prove there was some rational reason to do it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=3173)|
| 0:52:59| and the court found, as a finding of law,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=3179)|
| 0:53:02| that the legislature failed to articulate any concern about the sports authority| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=3182)|
| 0:53:07| or any reason to require the legislation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=3187)|
| 0:53:11| and, in fact, the same is true with the sports authority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=3191)|
| 0:53:14| Our sports authority, over the last 25 years, has been unbelievably successful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=3194)|
| 0:53:21| 25 years ago, we didn't have any professional teams here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=3201)|
| 0:53:25| We've got the Titans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=3205)|
| 0:53:26| We've got the Predators.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=3206)|
| 0:53:28| We've got AAA Baseball.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=3208)|
| 0:53:30| We have an MLS team with one of the highest season ticket sales of any of the teams in the MLS,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=3210)|
| 0:53:39| and, again, they had no criticism at all of the sports authority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=3219)|
| 0:53:43| They just said, oh, we just need to be involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=3223)|
| 0:53:46| So, yeah, there were reasons that had nothing to do with the business operations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=3226)|
| 0:53:53| or the success of either one of these authorities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=3233)|
| 0:53:56| So, essentially, and I ask because those are two exposure areas for us as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=3236)|
| 0:54:04| but even just sort of off-the-record comments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=3244)|
| 0:54:08| it sounds like there was nothing that pointed to any rational reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=3248)|
| 0:54:15| I mean, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=3255)|
| 0:54:17| Not a single rational reason or any criticism at all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=3257)|
| 0:54:25| whether it was legitimate or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=3265)|
| 0:54:27| There was no criticism of anything that either one of these authorities had done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=3267)|
| 0:54:31| Zero.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=3271)|
| 0:54:32| No criticism.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=3272)|
| 0:54:33| We just want to take over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=3273)|
| 0:54:36| If I could add something to what Wally was saying, which is right on point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=3276)|
| 0:54:44| The sponsors of the bills, let's start with the airport authority,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=3284)|
| 0:54:48| gave really a couple of reasons why they felt that the state needed to have control| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=3288)|
| 0:54:54| over the national airport.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=3294)|
| 0:54:57| One is that it was drawing in so many passengers from outside Davidson County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=3297)|
| 0:55:03| And the second is the state gives money to the airport authority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=3303)|
| 0:55:08| That is, of course, true,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=3308)|
| 0:55:10| but the Tyson Airport draws people from all over East Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=3310)|
| 0:55:15| and receives money from the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=3315)|
| 0:55:18| The Chattanooga Airport, the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=3318)|
| 0:55:20| The Memphis Airport, certainly the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=3320)|
| 0:55:23| And so the court in its opinion points out that, well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=3323)|
| 0:55:26| those are not reasons to distinguish Nashville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=3326)|
| 0:55:30| from any of the other metropolitan airports in Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=3330)|
| 0:55:33| And the same argument was made with regard to the sports authority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=3333)|
| 0:55:38| The state pointed to the fact that it was putting several hundred million dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=3338)|
| 0:55:42| into a new Titan Stadium,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=3342)|
| 0:55:44| and therefore they should have six seats on the sports authority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=3344)|
| 0:55:48| Well, the state is also putting several hundred million dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=3348)|
| 0:55:51| into Memphis sports facilities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=3351)|
| 0:55:53| and helping Knoxville with a baseball stadium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=3353)|
| 0:55:56| So, again, that is not a factor that can distinguish Nashville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=3356)|
| 0:56:00| from any of the other cities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=3360)|
| 0:56:02| So I think your conclusion is right on point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=3362)|
| 0:56:06| Okay. Thank you for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=3366)|
| 0:56:10| Thank you, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=3370)|
| 0:56:12| First, let me thank our guests for being here in person and remotely,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=3372)|
| 0:56:16| and a big shout out to CTV for this broadcast| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=3376)|
| 0:56:20| that I was able to listen to while I was stuck in traffic on my way here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=3380)|
| 0:56:25| I want to first say that this is disturbing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=3385)|
| 0:56:30| what we're seeing that's happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=3390)|
| 0:56:33| It appears that this is an unfortunate trend| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=3393)|
| 0:56:37| that I think is prevalent, not only a trend but a threat,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=3397)|
| 0:56:41| to local democracy and governing bodies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=3401)|
| 0:56:47| I would gather to say that there are underlying motives| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=3407)|
| 0:56:51| that drives these decisions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=3411)|
| 0:56:53| and that want to take away the power and the voices| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=3413)|
| 0:56:56| of the legislators locally who we all sit around this table| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=3416)|
| 0:57:00| and we're the voice of the people in our city and in our counties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=3420)|
| 0:57:08| But we know that this comes not just out of nowhere,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=3428)|
| 0:57:12| because someone has to bring the legislation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=3432)|
| 0:57:14| to the table at the General Assembly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=3434)|
| 0:57:17| And when we look at some of the things that we feel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=3437)|
| 0:57:20| that I personally feel are a little divisive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=3440)|
| 0:57:23| there are people who go rogue and are not doing this for the people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=3443)|
| 0:57:29| because this is not what we have heard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=3449)|
| 0:57:32| some of the things that have come up from the state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=3452)|
| 0:57:34| that are coming down to us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=3454)|
| 0:57:36| that our constituents here in the city want to see done here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=3456)|
| 0:57:41| And so I applaud your efforts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=3461)|
| 0:57:44| and the fight that you're in right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=3464)|
| 0:57:47| to be able to make sure that the people are represented| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=3467)|
| 0:57:50| at all levels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=3470)|
| 0:57:52| If it could happen to one airport, it could happen to any.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=3472)|
| 0:57:55| And so I feel that, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=3475)|
| 0:57:58| I just want to personally thank you all for standing up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=3478)|
| 0:58:01| for what you feel is right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=3481)|
| 0:58:03| and that represents the people that you represent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=3483)|
| 0:58:05| in Davidson County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=3485)|
| 0:58:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=3487)|
| 0:58:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=3488)|
| 0:58:09| We appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=3489)|
| 0:58:12| You know, it's been interesting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=3492)|
| 0:58:14| Everywhere I go, I have people come up to me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=3494)|
| 0:58:18| some I know, some I don't know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=3498)|
| 0:58:20| and just thank me and say, thank you for fighting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=3500)|
| 0:58:25| And of the people I do know, some are Republicans,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=3505)|
| 0:58:31| some are Democrats, some are independents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=3511)|
| 0:58:34| The thing they don't like is the state telling us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=3514)|
| 0:58:37| how to run our local government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=3517)|
| 0:58:40| They don't like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=3520)|
| 0:58:41| And they appreciate the fact that we are fighting back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=3521)|
| 0:58:46| And one of the reasons we wanted to visit with you today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=3526)|
| 0:58:50| is to share our experience| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=3530)|
| 0:58:53| and some of the hope that we have now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=3533)|
| 0:58:56| that's coming out of this litigation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=3536)|
| 0:58:59| We believe there are constitutional constraints| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=3539)|
| 0:59:02| on what the legislature can do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=3542)|
| 0:59:05| And so, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=3545)|
| 0:59:07| Thank you for your comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=3547)|
| 0:59:09| We all do appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=3549)|
| 0:59:10| You're welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=3550)|
| 0:59:11| And also, before my time is up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=3551)|
| 0:59:13| I want to turn to Mr. Frost| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=3553)|
| 0:59:15| because the term Metro government| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=3555)|
| 0:59:17| is not new to us here in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=3557)|
| 0:59:21| There were many, many years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=3561)|
| 0:59:22| I think within the last 15, maybe 15 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=3562)|
| 0:59:26| I don't know if you were serving on county commission at that time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=3566)|
| 0:59:29| when there were some rumblings about Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=3569)|
| 0:59:33| considering Metro government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=3573)|
| 0:59:35| Do you recall that, Rob?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=3575)|
| 0:59:36| Was that during your time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=3576)|
| 0:59:38| I believe that was before my time, Councilmember McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=3578)|
| 0:59:42| I believe Metro government proposal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=3582)|
| 0:59:45| for Knoxville and Knox County has been on the ballot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=3585)|
| 0:59:48| two, maybe three times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=3588)|
| 0:59:51| Dr. Lyons has done it before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=3591)|
| 0:59:53| I trust the man.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=3593)|
| 0:59:55| And it's lost every time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=3595)|
| 0:59:59| So, I think the political will to do that has subsided.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=3599)|
| 1:00:05| I just wanted to acknowledge that it's not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=3605)|
| 1:00:07| that conversation's not new to us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=3607)|
| 1:00:10| but this body, we've never encountered it until now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=3610)|
| 1:00:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=3613)|
| 1:00:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=3615)|
| 1:00:16| Councilmember Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=3616)|
| 1:00:18| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=3618)|
| 1:00:20| So, to our guests,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=3620)|
| 1:00:21| I'd like to get into the nuance of something specific.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=3621)|
| 1:00:26| One thing I wrote down that you said in many,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=3626)|
| 1:00:29| a couple of different times,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=3629)|
| 1:00:31| is that this legislation that comes across| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=3631)|
| 1:00:36| that would be a constitutional,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=3636)|
| 1:00:38| a state constitutional violation of home rule| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=3638)|
| 1:00:43| is when it targets one government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=3643)|
| 1:00:47| That's a fair repeating of what you said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=3647)|
| 1:00:50| Yes, that if the legislation targets one government,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=3650)|
| 1:00:55| and again, there is case law out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=3655)|
| 1:00:58| that has also struck down legislation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=3658)|
| 1:01:01| that say targets two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=3661)|
| 1:01:05| It's not a free pass if you just throw| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=3665)|
| 1:01:07| one more local jurisdiction into the bill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=3667)|
| 1:01:10| But yes, if it targets a particular city or county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=3670)|
| 1:01:17| in its governmental or proprietary capacity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=3677)|
| 1:01:20| but if you look at the definition of those two terms,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=3680)|
| 1:01:24| that essentially covers everything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=3684)|
| 1:01:25| that a city or county does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=3685)|
| 1:01:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=3688)|
| 1:01:31| Because specifically, I just want to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=3691)|
| 1:01:34| I think you've just answered my question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=3694)|
| 1:01:36| but when you were talking about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=3696)|
| 1:01:38| the educational savings account bill from 2019,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=3698)|
| 1:01:43| you said that applied to, I believe, two counties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=3703)|
| 1:01:48| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=3708)|
| 1:01:49| It applied in Davidson County and Shelby County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=3709)|
| 1:01:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=3712)|
| 1:01:53| And so you did file litigation on that one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=3713)|
| 1:01:56| We filed both Davidson, both Metro Nashville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=3716)|
| 1:02:00| and Shelby County joined together to file an action| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=3720)|
| 1:02:04| challenging that under the home rule amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=3724)|
| 1:02:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=3727)|
| 1:02:08| I think it's important to note, and so you won.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=3728)|
| 1:02:14| We won at the trial level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=3734)|
| 1:02:15| We won at the Court of Appeals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=3735)|
| 1:02:17| We did not win at the Supreme Court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=3737)|
| 1:02:19| So where does that stand?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=3739)|
| 1:02:22| As a challenge under the home rule amendment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=3742)|
| 1:02:25| that case is over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=3745)|
| 1:02:27| There is still litigation over whether or not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=3747)|
| 1:02:30| the bill satisfies the Equal Protection Clause.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=3750)|
| 1:02:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=3757)|
| 1:02:40| That is the one you said passed by one vote| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=3760)|
| 1:02:42| in the House?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=3762)|
| 1:02:44| Passed by one vote in the House.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=3764)|
| 1:02:46| And I believe Mr. Frost here reminded me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=3766)|
| 1:02:51| that was under Cassada's tenure as Speaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=3771)|
| 1:02:55| He was the Speaker at the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=3775)|
| 1:02:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=3776)|
| 1:02:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=3778)|
| 1:02:59| What were the qualifiers or what was the arguments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=3779)|
| 1:03:03| for it not passing at the Supreme Court level?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=3783)|
| 1:03:08| What was the rationale that the Supreme Court adopted?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=3788)|
| 1:03:10| Yeah, what was their opinion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=3790)|
| 1:03:12| The Supreme Court said based on the language of the statute| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=3792)|
| 1:03:16| that it was a program that applied| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=3796)|
| 1:03:18| to the local school system, not to the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=3798)|
| 1:03:22| and that the local school system doesn't fall| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=3802)|
| 1:03:25| within the home rule amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=3805)|
| 1:03:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=3808)|
| 1:03:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=3809)|
| 1:03:30| I just think it's food for thought and something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=3810)|
| 1:03:33| to think about in regards to our own issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=3813)|
| 1:03:37| So thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=3817)|
| 1:03:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=3819)|
| 1:03:41| I just was going to ask the panel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=3821)|
| 1:03:45| surely these instances are not limited to Nashville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=3825)|
| 1:03:49| or metro Nashville government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=3829)|
| 1:03:52| Are there other examples of actions that have occurred| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=3832)|
| 1:03:56| elsewhere outside of Nashville?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=3836)|
| 1:04:02| Certainly over time, if you go back from 1953 forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=3842)|
| 1:04:08| these cases have arisen out of all parts of the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=3848)|
| 1:04:12| But this most recent wave, the ESA legislation from 2019| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=3852)|
| 1:04:22| and then these bills passed this last session,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=3862)|
| 1:04:25| those have been targeted specifically at Nashville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=3865)|
| 1:04:31| and with the ESA case Shelby.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=3871)|
| 1:04:36| Has there ever been any activity in Chattanooga| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=3876)|
| 1:04:39| over these types of issues?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=3879)|
| 1:04:41| There's a significant case from 1979 involving| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=3881)|
| 1:04:45| the Chattanooga-Hamilton County Hospital Authority creation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=3885)|
| 1:04:50| and there was a lawsuit over that challenging| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=3890)|
| 1:04:56| the constitutionality of the acts that created it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=3896)|
| 1:05:02| It's a fairly complex transaction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=3902)|
| 1:05:06| The court ultimately upheld it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=3906)|
| 1:05:09| But that's the only case I can think of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=3909)|
| 1:05:13| at least that went up to the Supreme Court level,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=3913)|
| 1:05:15| involving Hamilton County and Chattanooga.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=3915)|
| 1:05:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=3918)|
| 1:05:20| Ms. Wynn, in your experience, is there any economic cost| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=3920)|
| 1:05:25| to state action on local matters to consider?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=3925)|
| 1:05:28| Specifically, I was thinking about administrative costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=3928)|
| 1:05:31| Is there anything to be concerned with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=3931)|
| 1:05:34| with that kind of state discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=3934)|
| 1:05:37| versus a local discussion and economic costs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=3937)|
| 1:05:40| I don't know that I could answer that question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=3940)|
| 1:05:44| I'd probably defer to Law Director Dietz| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=3944)|
| 1:05:49| as to whether or not that's something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=3949)|
| 1:05:53| that he might be able to answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=3953)|
| 1:05:55| Director Dietz?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=3955)|
| 1:05:58| Vice Mayor, there is a direct economic cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=3958)|
| 1:06:02| This litigation has been extremely expensive for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=3962)|
| 1:06:08| We have engaged outside counsel, Mr. Cooper,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=3968)|
| 1:06:12| General Cooper and his firm to assist us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=3972)|
| 1:06:15| because we did not have the capacity in-house| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=3975)|
| 1:06:19| at Metro Legal to handle all of these cases on our own.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=3979)|
| 1:06:24| While their bills are eminently reasonable and justifiable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=3984)|
| 1:06:29| it's been a significant amount of money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=3989)|
| 1:06:31| We've had to pay expert witnesses as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=3991)|
| 1:06:35| Plus, we have had multiple lawyers inside Metro Legal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=3995)|
| 1:06:39| devote a significant part of their time this year to these cases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=3999)|
| 1:06:43| There are other impacts as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=4003)|
| 1:06:45| Take the Airport Authority, for example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=4005)|
| 1:06:48| Our board was in exile for four months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=4008)|
| 1:06:52| In the meantime, the state-appointed board ratified over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=4012)|
| 1:06:58| several hundred million dollars' worth of contracts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=4018)|
| 1:07:01| over $100 million every month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=4021)|
| 1:07:04| They raised the salary of the CEO by more than 50%,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=4024)|
| 1:07:10| from $390,000 to $600,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=4030)|
| 1:07:13| That's a cost that's now going to be borne by the Airport Authority| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=4033)|
| 1:07:16| if it holds up after this transition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=4036)|
| 1:07:22| I think in terms of the ESA case,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=4042)|
| 1:07:27| there are burdens that are placed on Nashville and Memphis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=4047)|
| 1:07:31| There were burdens placed on that to administer that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=4051)|
| 1:07:35| that were economically disadvantageous for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=4055)|
| 1:07:41| We're looking into that a little bit more deeply| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=4061)|
| 1:07:45| as we go forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=4065)|
| 1:07:48| I think the thing that concerns me most is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=4068)|
| 1:07:52| it creates a climate of uncertainty,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=4072)|
| 1:07:55| which ultimately, I believe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=4075)|
| 1:07:57| may result in a loss of business confidence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=4077)|
| 1:08:01| If Metro Nashville or any city or Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=4081)|
| 1:08:05| is repeatedly under attack by the state,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=4085)|
| 1:08:09| and you're a firm that is looking at Nashville or Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=4089)|
| 1:08:14| to relocate, why would you choose that city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=4094)|
| 1:08:17| as opposed to going to some other city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=4097)|
| 1:08:21| where you don't have this sort of battle,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=4101)|
| 1:08:27| constitutional core governance issues in that battle?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=4107)|
| 1:08:31| It's hard to quantify.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=4111)|
| 1:08:33| I can't say that we lost a particular business relocation because of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=4113)|
| 1:08:40| but it certainly is disadvantageous to the image| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=4120)|
| 1:08:43| that we are trying to promote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=4123)|
| 1:08:46| It's better for all of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=4126)|
| 1:08:47| It's better for the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=4127)|
| 1:08:48| It's better for Nashville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=4128)|
| 1:08:50| If we are singing off the same page about some of these core issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=4130)|
| 1:08:54| we can disagree on policies about what's the best education policy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=4134)|
| 1:08:59| what's the best policy where the state has a lot of control,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=4139)|
| 1:09:06| if not exclusive control.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=4146)|
| 1:09:08| When it comes to these structural issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=4148)|
| 1:09:10| I think there will be an economic cost to the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=4150)|
| 1:09:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=4156)|
| 1:09:17| Council Member Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=4157)|
| 1:09:19| Yeah, just one other thought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=4159)|
| 1:09:21| This is specific to one of the things you brought up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=4161)|
| 1:09:23| That is outlandish,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=4163)|
| 1:09:25| the raising of the salary for the airport executive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=4165)|
| 1:09:29| I assume I may have that title wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=4169)|
| 1:09:32| Airport flight is federally regulated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=4172)|
| 1:09:36| There's FAA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=4176)|
| 1:09:38| Have there been federal issues or are there federal implications| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=4178)|
| 1:09:42| to some of the interruptions with the airport authority?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=4182)|
| 1:09:50| That's a great question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=4190)|
| 1:09:51| It's a really interesting issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=4191)|
| 1:09:54| I'm reckoning it could be a 30-minute or better conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=4194)|
| 1:09:57| I'll let you do what you can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=4197)|
| 1:09:59| I'll try to keep it really short.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=4199)|
| 1:10:04| The CEO and the sponsors of the legislation got legal opinion saying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=4204)|
| 1:10:10| the FAA had nothing to do with this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=4210)|
| 1:10:13| that they had no role in this change in the board at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=4213)|
| 1:10:18| I looked at the federal statute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=4218)|
| 1:10:20| I used to practice law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=4220)|
| 1:10:22| I still am licensed to practice law in D.C.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=4222)|
| 1:10:24| I hope so, but keep going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=4224)|
| 1:10:26| I looked at the federal statute and I go,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=4226)|
| 1:10:29| I don't think that's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=4229)|
| 1:10:30| I flew to Washington.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=4230)|
| 1:10:32| I retained the former general counsel to the FAA to assist us in dealing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=4232)|
| 1:10:37| with the FAA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=4237)|
| 1:10:38| I retained a former administrator,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=4238)|
| 1:10:42| deputy administrator of airports at the FAA who had been appointed first| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=4242)|
| 1:10:46| by George H.W. Bush and then by President Trump.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=4246)|
| 1:10:50| And we went to the FAA and said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=4250)|
| 1:10:53| do you have any idea what the state is getting ready to do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=4253)|
| 1:10:56| And they were angry because they had not been consulted at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=4256)|
| 1:11:01| And the FAA must approve a change of ownership or management of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=4261)|
| 1:11:06| certificate holder of the airport.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=4266)|
| 1:11:08| And they had not been consulted at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=4268)|
| 1:11:11| And so the FAA wrote a scathing letter to our,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=4271)|
| 1:11:17| our board and CEO saying, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=4277)|
| 1:11:21| we cannot believe you've not told us you've got to give us answers to all of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=4281)|
| 1:11:24| these questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=4284)|
| 1:11:25| And so as our board is going out of existence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=4285)|
| 1:11:30| in June the FAA issued a letter saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=4290)|
| 1:11:35| pursuant to a preexisting policy where this matter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=4295)|
| 1:11:39| this same issue had come up in Jackson, Mississippi and Atlanta and other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=4299)|
| 1:11:43| airports. Pursuant to our existing policy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=4303)|
| 1:11:46| if there is litigation over ownership and control of the airport,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=4306)|
| 1:11:49| the FAA will continue to recognize the preexisting board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=4309)|
| 1:11:54| So we got a letter saying, no matter what state law says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=4314)|
| 1:11:58| we recognize the Metro board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=4318)|
| 1:12:00| So my position is the Metro board never went out of existence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=4320)|
| 1:12:03| It was in exile.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=4323)|
| 1:12:06| But it's just one of those, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=4326)|
| 1:12:08| it's just one of those things where that part of the collateral damages,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=4328)|
| 1:12:12| the FAA, we're going to have to rebuild that relationship.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=4332)|
| 1:12:17| I'm pretty sure we can very quickly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=4337)|
| 1:12:19| but we're going to have to rebuild that relationship. So yeah,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=4339)|
| 1:12:24| the FAA had a lot to do with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=4344)|
| 1:12:27| Thank you. I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=4347)|
| 1:12:31| I appreciate Councilwoman McKenzie's kinder version of saying that some of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=4351)|
| 1:12:36| these things are very concerning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=4356)|
| 1:12:40| That is it's like a threat to democracy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=4360)|
| 1:12:43| I want to use some more inflammatory words.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=4363)|
| 1:12:48| This is these type of actions point to instability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=4368)|
| 1:12:55| It's things that you see associated with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=4375)|
| 1:13:00| I'll just restrain my words because I don't want to incite, but, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=4380)|
| 1:13:07| this is just not what you expect from democracy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=4387)|
| 1:13:10| And so it's very concerning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=4390)|
| 1:13:14| And I think there's a lot of people that there's not enough people paying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=4394)|
| 1:13:20| attention and there's a lot of people grossly concerned every time we get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=4400)|
| 1:13:23| closer to a legislative session and each legislative session raises more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=4403)|
| 1:13:29| concern and uncertainty amongst the few that are paying attention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=4409)|
| 1:13:37| So I wish, you know, everyone who is listening or watching this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=4417)|
| 1:13:41| please let people know because this is the kind of stuff that happens and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=4421)|
| 1:13:49| gets worse because you aren't paying attention and it happens before you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=4429)|
| 1:13:52| know it and it's over and it's beyond you and you're too late.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=4432)|
| 1:13:56| And that's grossly concerning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=4436)|
| 1:13:59| And it's coming from people who say that they don't want the federal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=4439)|
| 1:14:03| government to tell them what to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=4443)|
| 1:14:05| So it's government overreach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=4445)|
| 1:14:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=4450)|
| 1:14:12| Director Dietz, you had mentioned that you're careful about when you're filing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=4452)|
| 1:14:16| lawsuits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=4456)|
| 1:14:17| Could you discuss any parameters that you use to evaluate yourself or pause| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=4457)|
| 1:14:25| as you're considering the potentials for pursuing litigation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=4465)|
| 1:14:31| Thank you, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=4471)|
| 1:14:32| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=4472)|
| 1:14:33| The first analysis is do we have a claim?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=4473)|
| 1:14:40| Do we have a claim that we believe is grounded solidly in the law?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=4480)|
| 1:14:48| And so that's where that's where we start.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=4488)|
| 1:14:51| That sounds simple.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=4491)|
| 1:14:52| But I've been asked multiple times this year to file lawsuits simply as a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=4492)|
| 1:14:58| form of protest because we don't like it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=4498)|
| 1:15:01| And I'm not going to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=4501)|
| 1:15:03| I'm not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=4503)|
| 1:15:04| I think our reputation with the courts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=4504)|
| 1:15:07| our reputation is really important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=4507)|
| 1:15:09| When we go to the court,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=4509)|
| 1:15:11| I want the court to know that we're not there as a form of protest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=4511)|
| 1:15:15| We are there because we believe our constitutional rights have been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=4515)|
| 1:15:18| violated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=4518)|
| 1:15:19| So that is that is the first and overwhelmingly the most important| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=4519)|
| 1:15:27| factor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=4527)|
| 1:15:28| Do we believe we have a constitutional claim?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=4528)|
| 1:15:31| And so far,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=4531)|
| 1:15:33| the courts have agreed that we are right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=4533)|
| 1:15:35| that we do have a constitutional claim.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=4535)|
| 1:15:37| And so that's been very gratifying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=4537)|
| 1:15:41| There are there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=4541)|
| 1:15:43| Again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=4543)|
| 1:15:44| I referenced the community oversight board because I have friends on that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=4544)|
| 1:15:48| board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=4548)|
| 1:15:49| A lot of people I'm very friendly with were strong supporters of that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=4549)|
| 1:15:53| board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=4553)|
| 1:15:54| And they were extremely angry about that board being cut back in terms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=4554)|
| 1:15:58| of its authority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=4558)|
| 1:15:59| But we just didn't have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=4559)|
| 1:16:01| we didn't have a good case and I hated to bear that news,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=4561)|
| 1:16:05| but we, but, but we didn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=4565)|
| 1:16:08| Then there, there was another case that I mentioned this before the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=4568)|
| 1:16:11| convention center case where.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=4571)|
| 1:16:14| Our convention center was the only one affected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=4574)|
| 1:16:17| But the net result is that we have the comptroller and other state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=4577)|
| 1:16:21| officials on that board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=4581)|
| 1:16:24| And, and we decided that was actually helpful to Nashville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=4584)|
| 1:16:29| And so that's, that's, that's, that's, that's,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=4589)|
| 1:16:31| that's why we're so grateful for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=4591)|
| 1:16:36| They were on the board as ex officio members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=4596)|
| 1:16:38| They did not take the place of any of our board members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=4598)|
| 1:16:41| And to have that sort of interaction between high levels of the state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=4601)|
| 1:16:45| government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=4605)|
| 1:16:46| And one of the economic engines in Nashville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=4606)|
| 1:16:49| that convention center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=4609)|
| 1:16:50| Is hugely successful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=4610)|
| 1:16:52| And very important to our finances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=4612)|
| 1:16:55| So, so, so, so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=4615)|
| 1:16:57| So we would have had the promotion of tourism.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=4617)|
| 1:16:59| So we welcome that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=4619)|
| 1:17:07| We probably could have sued over that bill, but we thought, well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=4627)|
| 1:17:09| you know, that that result is actually good. And.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=4629)|
| 1:17:13| So, you know, we look at, we look at all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=4633)|
| 1:17:15| we look at all all of those factors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=4635)|
| 1:17:19| And we look at our internal capacity. And if we,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=4639)|
| 1:17:22| if we do not have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=4642)|
| 1:17:23| and these issues were so important,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=4643)|
| 1:17:25| we decided to spend the money to retain outside counsel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=4645)|
| 1:17:29| So all of those factors come into play.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=4649)|
| 1:17:35| And again, I just want to emphasize our goal here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=4655)|
| 1:17:41| is to create a better working relationship| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=4661)|
| 1:17:44| with the state at the end of the day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=4664)|
| 1:17:46| We're not trying to antagonize the state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=4666)|
| 1:17:49| for the purpose of antagonizing the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=4669)|
| 1:17:51| We want to protect our constitutional rights| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=4671)|
| 1:17:55| and we are sending this signal every which way we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=4675)|
| 1:18:00| Yes, we filed these lawsuits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=4680)|
| 1:18:01| because we felt like we had to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=4681)|
| 1:18:04| to protect our constitutional rights,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=4684)|
| 1:18:05| but we do not want to be in this litigation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=4685)|
| 1:18:08| time and time again, over and over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=4688)|
| 1:18:10| And we want to get to a different level of discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=4690)|
| 1:18:14| where our concerns can be heard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=4694)|
| 1:18:16| before it gets to this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=4696)|
| 1:18:17| So we invested in this litigation this year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=4697)|
| 1:18:21| because we believed it was existential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=4701)|
| 1:18:28| literally existential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=4708)|
| 1:18:29| Are we gonna let the state control the size of our counsel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=4709)|
| 1:18:32| take over our airport,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=4712)|
| 1:18:34| do all of these things without fighting back?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=4714)|
| 1:18:37| So at the end of the day, it was an easy decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=4717)|
| 1:18:41| Difficult because it's created some turmoil with the state,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=4721)|
| 1:18:46| but whether to file the lawsuit in these four cases,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=4726)|
| 1:18:50| it, I never second guessed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=4730)|
| 1:18:55| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=4735)|
| 1:18:57| Looking, Council Member Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=4737)|
| 1:19:00| Yes, I simply want to thank you all for coming today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=4740)|
| 1:19:03| and sharing your experiences with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=4743)|
| 1:19:05| It's really been invaluable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=4745)|
| 1:19:07| We've all listened very carefully| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=4747)|
| 1:19:09| and this will really help us put things into some context| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=4749)|
| 1:19:14| about our particular situation here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=4754)|
| 1:19:16| So really appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=4756)|
| 1:19:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=4757)|
| 1:19:20| We thank you for the time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=4760)|
| 1:19:21| and we stand ready to take phone calls| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=4761)|
| 1:19:23| to consult with you as needed as you confront your issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=4763)|
| 1:19:28| Again, hopefully the state will be more mindful| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=4768)|
| 1:19:33| of protecting the rights of local governments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=4773)|
| 1:19:36| We'll see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=4776)|
| 1:19:37| We can only hope that this litigation has some impact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=4777)|
| 1:19:42| to change that relationship, but we appreciate your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=4782)|
| 1:19:45| And we are very grateful for your interest in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=4785)|
| 1:19:49| We think every local government in Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=4789)|
| 1:19:52| should be interested in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=4792)|
| 1:19:53| It's not a partisan issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=4793)|
| 1:19:55| It's not Republican versus Democrat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=4795)|
| 1:19:57| It's not that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=4797)|
| 1:19:58| It's a matter of protecting what the constitution gives us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=4798)|
| 1:20:03| which is the ability of local governments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=4803)|
| 1:20:05| to do what they do without being targeted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=4805)|
| 1:20:08| specifically targeted by the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=4808)|
| 1:20:12| And I would just add to that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=4812)|
| 1:20:13| very much appreciate your comment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=4813)|
| 1:20:16| but it really does,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=4816)|
| 1:20:19| we're glad that you are receptive to this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=4819)|
| 1:20:21| and welcome the opportunity to work with you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=4821)|
| 1:20:23| because any one lawsuit here as to Home Rule Amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=4823)|
| 1:20:30| is going to have an effect on everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=4830)|
| 1:20:32| But frankly, the best way to win this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=4832)|
| 1:20:37| is not to be in the position| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=4837)|
| 1:20:39| where we have to bring a lawsuit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=4839)|
| 1:20:40| and that's for all of us to work together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=4840)|
| 1:20:42| so that if one local government is threatened,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=4842)|
| 1:20:47| then we all recognize that as a threat to everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=4847)|
| 1:20:51| Because, for example, as with the voucher litigation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=4851)|
| 1:20:58| just because it was limited to one or two cities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=4858)|
| 1:21:00| doesn't mean it's not going to expand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=4860)|
| 1:21:02| once there's a toehold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=4862)|
| 1:21:04| And that will be the same thing with others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=4864)|
| 1:21:05| So the more we can work together,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=4865)|
| 1:21:08| I think the more successful we will all be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=4868)|
| 1:21:13| Let me just say thank you to all of you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=4873)|
| 1:21:15| for allowing us to come and share.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=4875)|
| 1:21:18| We appreciate this opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=4878)|
| 1:21:20| and if we can help in any way, just let us know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=4880)|
| 1:21:23| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=4883)|
| 1:21:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=4885)|
| 1:21:26| And what I gathered from our discussion today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=4886)|
| 1:21:30| was obviously specifics about home rule,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=4890)|
| 1:21:32| but also the importance of relationships.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=4892)|
| 1:21:35| And I know Director Dietz was just talking about that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=4895)|
| 1:21:39| in his last remarks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=4899)|
| 1:21:41| It's important for us to have good relationships| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=4901)|
| 1:21:44| with our state legislature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=4904)|
| 1:21:47| This council has worked very hard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=4907)|
| 1:21:50| on maintaining good relations with our state representatives| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=4910)|
| 1:21:53| and our local representatives here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=4913)|
| 1:21:56| We've hosted joint workshops with our county partners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=4916)|
| 1:22:02| as well as having attendance from our state partners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=4922)|
| 1:22:05| on subjects like mental health.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=4925)|
| 1:22:08| Recognizing how important these relationships are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=4928)|
| 1:22:11| council has begun going and visiting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=4931)|
| 1:22:14| and having a day on the hill in Nashville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=4934)|
| 1:22:16| to meet with our local representatives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=4936)|
| 1:22:19| So I'm glad that you all were so specific about relationships| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=4939)|
| 1:22:23| because that's important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=4943)|
| 1:22:25| But then following up on what General Cooper was saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=4945)|
| 1:22:29| those relationships are certainly important,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=4949)|
| 1:22:31| but so are the relationships we have with other cities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=4951)|
| 1:22:35| other counties, other home rule communities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=4955)|
| 1:22:37| just other communities across our state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=4957)|
| 1:22:41| Because any action on this is certainly impacting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=4961)|
| 1:22:44| not only one individual community, but the whole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=4964)|
| 1:22:48| So I think relationships is an important piece.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=4968)|
| 1:22:51| It's been said a bunch tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=4971)|
| 1:22:53| that this is not a partisan issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=4973)|
| 1:22:55| Rather, it's really an issue that we all need to take up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=4975)|
| 1:22:59| and we all need to care about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=4979)|
| 1:23:00| And so hopefully our discussion tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=4980)|
| 1:23:03| can raise that awareness,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=4983)|
| 1:23:04| not only here in Knoxville, but across the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=4984)|
| 1:23:09| This really goes to core principles of our very democracy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=4989)|
| 1:23:11| as we've talked about this evening,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=4991)|
| 1:23:13| as a fundamental constitutional issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=4993)|
| 1:23:16| And so I think it's just critical| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=4996)|
| 1:23:18| that we're all engaged in this conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=4998)|
| 1:23:25| What I had, I kind of began thinking about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=5005)|
| 1:23:29| the late Senator Howard Baker,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=5009)|
| 1:23:31| but in 1966, he had said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=5011)|
| 1:23:35| I believe that if the cities and counties of our state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=5015)|
| 1:23:39| and the state itself are supplied| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=5019)|
| 1:23:41| with the practical authority to govern| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=5021)|
| 1:23:43| by means of their economic strength,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=5023)|
| 1:23:45| to carry out their programs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=5025)|
| 1:23:47| the tax dollar will go further.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=5027)|
| 1:23:49| Administrative costs will be lessened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=5029)|
| 1:23:52| Greater flexibility and accommodation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=5032)|
| 1:23:54| of the local problems will result,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=5034)|
| 1:23:55| and the very essence of freedom and self-government| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=5035)|
| 1:23:59| will be reinforced and intensified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=5039)|
| 1:24:02| I think those were true in 1966 and they're true today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=5042)|
| 1:24:06| And so this workshop had a lot to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=5046)|
| 1:24:09| with those specific comments that he had made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=5049)|
| 1:24:13| What I would like to do is, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=5053)|
| 1:24:14| thank our distinguished guests| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=5054)|
| 1:24:16| for joining us virtually and here in person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=5056)|
| 1:24:19| We really appreciate you traveling| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=5059)|
| 1:24:22| and spending time with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=5062)|
| 1:24:24| Please, when you return to Nashville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=5064)|
| 1:24:26| let your colleagues know that Knoxville is interested| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=5066)|
| 1:24:31| in what is happening in Nashville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=5071)|
| 1:24:33| We care about what's happening in Nashville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=5073)|
| 1:24:36| just as we care about what's happening across the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=5076)|
| 1:24:39| So hopefully you can deliver that message for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=5079)|
| 1:24:41| Again, we really appreciate you all joining us this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=5081)|
| 1:24:45| Thank you for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=5085)|
| 1:24:47| And with that, this meeting is adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=5087)|
| 1:24:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-231109?start=5090)|
