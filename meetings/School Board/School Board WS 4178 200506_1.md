| 1:46:57| It was horrible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6417)|
| 1:46:58| I mean, the instruction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6418)|
| 1:46:59| was terrible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6419)|
| 1:47:01| and they had the technology.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6421)|
| 1:47:03| But what we've got to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6423)|
| 1:47:04| is work with our teachers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6424)|
| 1:47:06| to train them on how to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6426)|
| 1:47:08| to offer remote technology| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6428)|
| 1:47:10| in the case that it happens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6430)|
| 1:47:11| And obviously it doesn't need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6431)|
| 1:47:12| to take up all of our time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6432)|
| 1:47:14| but just having a device| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6434)|
| 1:47:15| does not make for good instruction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6435)|
| 1:47:18| And so I just want to keep that in mind| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6438)|
| 1:47:20| that I really support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6440)|
| 1:47:21| we have got to do great| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6441)|
| 1:47:23| professional development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6443)|
| 1:47:24| with our teachers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6444)|
| 1:47:25| to support them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6445)|
| 1:47:26| to be able to do this well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6446)|
| 1:47:29| Yes, I definitely agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6449)|
| 1:47:34| And I've also, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6454)|
| 1:47:36| I've had firsthand experience| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6456)|
| 1:47:37| with my daughter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6457)|
| 1:47:38| doing remote learning in college.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6458)|
| 1:47:41| And, you know, I'm not sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6461)|
| 1:47:43| she really learned that much| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6463)|
| 1:47:45| in the past couple of weeks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6465)|
| 1:47:46| because her teachers, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6466)|
| 1:47:49| haven't really been trained on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6469)|
| 1:47:50| And so I've also read several reports| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6470)|
| 1:47:52| from around the country| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6472)|
| 1:47:54| of people who have remote learning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6474)|
| 1:47:56| And it's been a challenge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6476)|
| 1:47:58| I've talked to friends who have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6478)|
| 1:48:01| who are teachers and our parents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6481)|
| 1:48:02| in private schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6482)|
| 1:48:04| And it has been a real challenge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6484)|
| 1:48:06| I honestly haven't have heard very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6486)|
| 1:48:08| I've heard a lot more negative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6488)|
| 1:48:10| than positive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6490)|
| 1:48:12| So it our teachers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6492)|
| 1:48:14| definitely need training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6494)|
| 1:48:16| And I'm glad that then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6496)|
| 1:48:19| Shannon and Teresa| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6499)|
| 1:48:20| have been working on that so much| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6500)|
| 1:48:22| because that's true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6502)|
| 1:48:23| I mean, and I think that the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6503)|
| 1:48:25| one of the biggest things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6505)|
| 1:48:27| that I've seen over this time frame| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6507)|
| 1:48:30| is that this really to me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6510)|
| 1:48:35| just confirms how important| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6515)|
| 1:48:38| our teachers are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6518)|
| 1:48:40| and the relationships| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6520)|
| 1:48:41| that they have with students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6521)|
| 1:48:43| I think that that just cannot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6523)|
| 1:48:46| be overestimated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6526)|
| 1:48:48| The impact that teachers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6528)|
| 1:48:51| have on students is immeasurable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6531)|
| 1:48:55| because even if you have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6535)|
| 1:48:56| a great teacher| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6536)|
| 1:48:58| who's teaching on the screen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6538)|
| 1:49:00| if it's not your teacher| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6540)|
| 1:49:02| that you have a relationship with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6542)|
| 1:49:04| and you know as a child| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6544)|
| 1:49:05| that that teacher cares about you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6545)|
| 1:49:07| the kid's just not going to get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6547)|
| 1:49:08| as much out of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6548)|
| 1:49:09| That's just how we're wired.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6549)|
| 1:49:11| So, you know, I don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6551)|
| 1:49:14| I don't want anybody to think that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6554)|
| 1:49:16| that I mean, I think that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6556)|
| 1:49:18| that's what we've seen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6558)|
| 1:49:19| over the past several weeks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6559)|
| 1:49:21| is how important| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6561)|
| 1:49:24| are those relationships are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6564)|
| 1:49:26| how important it is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6566)|
| 1:49:27| that we are in classrooms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6567)|
| 1:49:29| So, you know, going back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6569)|
| 1:49:31| to our conversation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6571)|
| 1:49:32| with Dr. Buchanan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6572)|
| 1:49:34| I hope that people will abide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6574)|
| 1:49:36| by the guidelines| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6576)|
| 1:49:37| and do what we can do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6577)|
| 1:49:38| to stay healthy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6578)|
| 1:49:39| so our kids can be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6579)|
| 1:49:40| in the classroom in August.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6580)|
| 1:49:41| We just that is what we need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6581)|
| 1:49:44| And I it's challenging| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6584)|
| 1:49:49| because I also agree| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6589)|
| 1:49:52| with with a lot of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6592)|
| 1:49:53| what Ms. Satterfield said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6593)|
| 1:49:54| about just the funding issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6594)|
| 1:49:56| going forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6596)|
| 1:49:57| We're not going to have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6597)|
| 1:49:58| this is the only time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6598)|
| 1:49:59| that we're going to have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6599)|
| 1:50:02| funding like this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6602)|
| 1:50:03| that we can utilize for technology.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6603)|
| 1:50:06| And we we hear all the time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6606)|
| 1:50:08| you know, how behind we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6608)|
| 1:50:10| So we need the technology| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6610)|
| 1:50:13| and at the same time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6613)|
| 1:50:14| we are going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6614)|
| 1:50:15| it's going to be a constant battle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6615)|
| 1:50:17| with with the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6617)|
| 1:50:18| There's just no question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6618)|
| 1:50:19| But at the same time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6619)|
| 1:50:20| we need this technology.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6620)|
| 1:50:22| And if we don't do this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6622)|
| 1:50:23| if we don't buy the technology| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6623)|
| 1:50:25| and we are in the same situation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6625)|
| 1:50:26| in the fall,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6626)|
| 1:50:27| what are we going to do then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6627)|
| 1:50:29| Because we will at that point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6629)|
| 1:50:32| we will have no options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6632)|
| 1:50:34| So so, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6634)|
| 1:50:37| I think that the team| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6637)|
| 1:50:40| has been talking about this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6640)|
| 1:50:41| for the past eight years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6641)|
| 1:50:43| in purchasing technology| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6643)|
| 1:50:44| for more of our students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6644)|
| 1:50:46| And and we know that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6646)|
| 1:50:48| we know that a lot of our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6648)|
| 1:50:49| a lot of the expectation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6649)|
| 1:50:51| of our community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6651)|
| 1:50:52| is that we should| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6652)|
| 1:50:53| already be providing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6653)|
| 1:50:54| So, yes, it's going to continue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6654)|
| 1:50:56| to be a challenge with the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6656)|
| 1:50:57| There's no doubt about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6657)|
| 1:50:59| And and Ms. Fab,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6659)|
| 1:51:00| I hope I think that you're right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6660)|
| 1:51:01| I think we probably do have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6661)|
| 1:51:03| a lot of community partners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6663)|
| 1:51:05| that we can that we can follow up with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6665)|
| 1:51:08| And I think, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6668)|
| 1:51:11| the superintendent and Dr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6671)|
| 1:51:12| Ryswick and some other folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6672)|
| 1:51:14| were on on that call| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6674)|
| 1:51:15| that he mentioned earlier last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6675)|
| 1:51:17| So we have community members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6677)|
| 1:51:19| who are interested in in helping us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6679)|
| 1:51:22| So we'll definitely| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6682)|
| 1:51:23| need to work on those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6683)|
| 1:51:25| Ms. Satterfield?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6685)|
| 1:51:26| There and I don't know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6686)|
| 1:51:28| the superintendent, John,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6688)|
| 1:51:29| have we done an inventory| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6689)|
| 1:51:31| on which devices| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6691)|
| 1:51:32| are still up to date| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6692)|
| 1:51:34| that possibly we could do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6694)|
| 1:51:36| a rollout type approach?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6696)|
| 1:51:38| Is there is there a number?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6698)|
| 1:51:39| Because, like I said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6699)|
| 1:51:41| a lot of my schools are one to one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6701)|
| 1:51:42| A lot of Virginia schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6702)|
| 1:51:43| are one to one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6703)|
| 1:51:44| because of the previous sources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6704)|
| 1:51:45| But I also know that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6705)|
| 1:51:46| the Google Chrome situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6706)|
| 1:51:48| So I'm just curious,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6708)|
| 1:51:49| is there an inventory| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6709)|
| 1:51:50| already taken regarding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6710)|
| 1:51:52| what's still to where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6712)|
| 1:51:53| if we spent five million dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6713)|
| 1:51:55| out of the CARES Act?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6715)|
| 1:51:56| Because I do agree| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6716)|
| 1:51:57| that this is the one time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6717)|
| 1:51:58| shot of money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6718)|
| 1:51:58| But if we spend five million,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6718)|
| 1:52:00| that still frees up to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6720)|
| 1:52:02| just ways to work that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6722)|
| 1:52:04| I'm just curious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6724)|
| 1:52:05| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6725)|
| 1:52:05| And Ms. Byard probably| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6725)|
| 1:52:07| needs to be the one to answer that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6727)|
| 1:52:08| I know she's been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6728)|
| 1:52:09| she she may have that already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6729)|
| 1:52:10| I know she's been working on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6730)|
| 1:52:12| So let me let me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6732)|
| 1:52:13| if Ms. Byard's still on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6733)|
| 1:52:15| let me let her join| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6735)|
| 1:52:16| in the conversation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6736)|
| 1:52:17| and respond to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6737)|
| 1:52:20| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6740)|
| 1:52:20| And yes, Ms. Satterfield,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6740)|
| 1:52:22| we do know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6742)|
| 1:52:24| the the status of each device| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6744)|
| 1:52:25| and what operating system is on them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6745)|
| 1:52:27| We have 19,950,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6747)|
| 1:52:33| I think, devices| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6753)|
| 1:52:36| that will be going out of support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6756)|
| 1:52:37| September of 2021.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6757)|
| 1:52:39| So that's why I'm saying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6759)|
| 1:52:40| the end of next school year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6760)|
| 1:52:42| and then another 14,070 some odd| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6762)|
| 1:52:46| that will be going out of support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6766)|
| 1:52:48| June of 2022.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6768)|
| 1:52:49| So your point is well taken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6769)|
| 1:52:52| That, you know, we need to very much| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6772)|
| 1:52:56| look at the granular details| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6776)|
| 1:52:58| of how many devices we are ordering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6778)|
| 1:53:01| and and we are doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6781)|
| 1:53:03| But we don't want to get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6783)|
| 1:53:04| into a situation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6784)|
| 1:53:06| particularly with some schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6786)|
| 1:53:07| that have used title funds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6787)|
| 1:53:09| to buy devices where,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6789)|
| 1:53:12| you know, we're buying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6792)|
| 1:53:13| for the entire district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6793)|
| 1:53:14| and and not for the title schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6794)|
| 1:53:17| So we have to be very equitable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6797)|
| 1:53:19| when it comes to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6799)|
| 1:53:20| you know, allocating those funds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6800)|
| 1:53:23| across the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6803)|
| 1:53:24| OK, so yes, I hear that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6804)|
| 1:53:27| And I 100 percent agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6807)|
| 1:53:30| But I had the opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6810)|
| 1:53:31| to have my budget meeting this morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6811)|
| 1:53:33| This is just me just expressing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6813)|
| 1:53:35| my disdain right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6815)|
| 1:53:38| And there is a lot of other impacts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6818)|
| 1:53:41| to where September 21| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6821)|
| 1:53:43| and in June of 2022,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6823)|
| 1:53:46| I personally feel like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6826)|
| 1:53:47| there could be a rollout| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6827)|
| 1:53:49| because that's thirty five thousand dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6829)|
| 1:53:51| There's thirty five thousand devices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6831)|
| 1:53:53| So that's only half that we will need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6833)|
| 1:53:56| So the equitable part| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6836)|
| 1:53:58| that you mentioned regarding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6838)|
| 1:54:01| title one and I get that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6841)|
| 1:54:02| I understand that we don't want them to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6842)|
| 1:54:04| We don't I don't want my schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6844)|
| 1:54:06| and our title one funding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6846)|
| 1:54:07| schools to be left out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6847)|
| 1:54:08| But I also don't want my title| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6848)|
| 1:54:09| one school schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6849)|
| 1:54:11| and my priority schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6851)|
| 1:54:12| and everything else| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6852)|
| 1:54:13| to be drastically impacted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6853)|
| 1:54:15| because we're making this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6855)|
| 1:54:17| this purchase of basically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6857)|
| 1:54:20| ending two years worth of devices early| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6860)|
| 1:54:23| just because we have this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6863)|
| 1:54:24| blanket amount of money right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6864)|
| 1:54:26| So that's all I'm going to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6866)|
| 1:54:27| because that's just where I'm at with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6867)|
| 1:54:32| I just want I'm at with it now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6872)|
| 1:54:33| but I just wanted to make sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6873)|
| 1:54:34| that the board members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6874)|
| 1:54:35| understood my perspective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6875)|
| 1:54:37| And I think it's a very valid point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6877)|
| 1:54:39| And I think if you if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6879)|
| 1:54:41| you guys could go back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6881)|
| 1:54:42| and and look at it that way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6882)|
| 1:54:44| and that would be helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6884)|
| 1:54:48| Be glad to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6888)|
| 1:54:48| OK, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6888)|
| 1:54:50| And, you know, I also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6890)|
| 1:54:51| I want to make the point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6891)|
| 1:54:52| because I've heard from some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6892)|
| 1:54:53| some high school business teachers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6893)|
| 1:54:55| who are concerned about the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6895)|
| 1:54:57| like like Miss Satterfield| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6897)|
| 1:54:59| said that some of the software| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6899)|
| 1:55:00| is not supported on Chromebooks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6900)|
| 1:55:02| So we just need to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6902)|
| 1:55:04| it just needs to be reiterated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6904)|
| 1:55:06| that this is not an end all be all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6906)|
| 1:55:09| If we are on if we're online in the fall,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6909)|
| 1:55:12| it's not going to be a perfect world.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6912)|
| 1:55:14| It's still going to be a huge challenge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6914)|
| 1:55:16| It there may be classes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6916)|
| 1:55:18| that that are still at a disadvantage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6918)|
| 1:55:21| So so anyway, that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6921)|
| 1:55:23| that is a challenge and that's a concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6923)|
| 1:55:25| I know for those teachers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6925)|
| 1:55:27| who teach those classes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6927)|
| 1:55:30| in schools where they would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6930)|
| 1:55:32| with the kids would be using Chromebooks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6932)|
| 1:55:34| So that's that's a that's a concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6934)|
| 1:55:39| Miss Owen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6939)|
| 1:55:40| Yes, thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6940)|
| 1:55:42| I just want to kind of note| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6942)|
| 1:55:44| that if we have around 33,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6944)|
| 1:55:48| that are going out of support by next year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6948)|
| 1:55:50| but we only have 40,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6950)|
| 1:55:53| then we're just looking at a few| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6953)|
| 1:55:55| that would still be in support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6955)|
| 1:55:57| So the the rest of that number| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6957)|
| 1:56:02| is either devices we don't have at all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6962)|
| 1:56:06| or a very limited number| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6966)|
| 1:56:08| that would be in support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6968)|
| 1:56:08| And I think we previously had an email| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6968)|
| 1:56:10| that said we had only about 6000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6970)|
| 1:56:13| that would be in support at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6973)|
| 1:56:14| I'll be on that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6974)|
| 1:56:16| So it's not that we have 33,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6976)|
| 1:56:20| They're going out of support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6980)|
| 1:56:21| and then we have that other number| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6981)|
| 1:56:23| that are good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6983)|
| 1:56:23| We only have that tiny limited| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6983)|
| 1:56:26| about 6000 that would still be in support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6986)|
| 1:56:31| We haven't really talked about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6991)|
| 1:56:33| looking at the the self insurance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6993)|
| 1:56:37| And I really appreciate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6997)|
| 1:56:38| by the way, yesterday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6998)|
| 1:56:40| Mr. Thomas and Gail Byard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=7000)|
| 1:56:42| and Ron McPherson and Freddie Cox| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=7002)|
| 1:56:44| answering some of my questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=7004)|
| 1:56:47| One of those was about the the insurance cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=7007)|
| 1:56:51| And we talked about that cost| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=7011)|
| 1:56:54| and also community partners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=7014)|
| 1:56:55| helping with things like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=7015)|
| 1:56:57| getting broadband access| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=7017)|
| 1:56:59| and all of those things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=7019)|
| 1:57:00| But also we talked about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=7020)|
| 1:57:02| community partners helping| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=7022)|
| 1:57:05| with the cost of that self insurance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=7025)|
| 1:57:08| And if we had enough community partners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=7028)|
| 1:57:10| to help with that to the point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=7030)|
| 1:57:12| that all of our students were covered,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=7032)|
| 1:57:16| then that would be $30 per year for students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=7036)|
| 1:57:21| And then in that pool| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=7041)|
| 1:57:23| of of self insurance funding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=7043)|
| 1:57:27| that would be quite a chunk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=7047)|
| 1:57:29| that could go toward those new devices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=7049)|
| 1:57:32| Because all of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=7052)|
| 1:57:33| obviously, with insurance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=7053)|
| 1:57:35| you don't always use it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=7055)|
| 1:57:36| You know, there's going to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=7056)|
| 1:57:38| most of that is just the just in case money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=7058)|
| 1:57:42| So the cost is $50 per year for her device,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=7062)|
| 1:57:46| the insurance at $30 per year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=7066)|
| 1:57:49| So it's really just that $20 per year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=7069)|
| 1:57:52| that we would be completely lacking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=7072)|
| 1:57:56| Does that make sense?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=7076)|
| 1:57:59| So it's not as huge a cost per year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=7079)|
| 1:58:02| as we're looking at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=7082)|
| 1:58:03| if we can get community partners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=7083)|
| 1:58:05| to help with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=7085)|
| 1:58:07| I think so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=7087)|
| 1:58:08| And the meeting Friday, Susan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=7088)|
| 1:58:11| alluded to it too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=7091)|
| 1:58:12| Meeting Friday was basically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=7092)|
| 1:58:14| how as a community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=7094)|
| 1:58:15| community, can we help you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=7095)|
| 1:58:17| So I think that's a,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=7097)|
| 1:58:18| you know, that's an excellent suggestion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=7098)|
| 1:58:20| to to take back to to this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=7100)|
| 1:58:23| to the task force is working on that as a way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=7103)|
| 1:58:25| And of course, the Internet access is key to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=7105)|
| 1:58:28| it doesn't do any good to have a laptop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=7108)|
| 1:58:30| if you don't have access.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=7110)|
| 1:58:31| And that's got to be a priority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=7111)|
| 1:58:34| So we're not spending our money wisely| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=7114)|
| 1:58:37| if our families don't have access.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=7117)|
| 1:58:39| So that's got to be a high priority as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=7119)|
| 1:58:42| And the questions have been very insightful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=7122)|
| 1:58:46| And I know I've been thinking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=7126)|
| 1:58:47| as I've been listening to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=7127)|
| 1:58:48| So that's a lot of things for us to go back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=7128)|
| 1:58:50| and sort of rehash.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=7130)|
| 1:58:53| And Ms. Satterfield's right too on the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=7133)|
| 1:58:56| you know, she had her budget meeting today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=7136)|
| 1:58:57| You know, we've got budget meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=7137)|
| 1:58:58| with board members and coming up too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=7138)|
| 1:59:01| And definitely looking at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=7141)|
| 1:59:05| a crisis with our budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=7145)|
| 1:59:06| So talk a lot about that tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=7146)|
| 1:59:09| since we're going to meet individually with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=7149)|
| 1:59:11| But we also plan to have a community meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=7151)|
| 1:59:14| so that we can inform folks too| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=7154)|
| 1:59:16| after we have an opportunity to talk to board members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=7156)|
| 1:59:18| and kind of lay out where we are with budget and all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=7158)|
| 1:59:21| But yeah, I think the community help| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=7161)|
| 1:59:24| with the insurance is a great idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=7164)|
| 1:59:29| I think from a budget perspective,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=7169)|
| 1:59:32| there are folks who are always asking us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=7172)|
| 1:59:34| to ask for what we need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=7174)|
| 1:59:36| And I think that's not just asking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=7176)|
| 1:59:39| for that budget line that we need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=7179)|
| 1:59:42| It's asking the whole community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=7182)|
| 1:59:44| I think we've not done a very good job| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=7184)|
| 1:59:46| of going out in the community and saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=7186)|
| 1:59:49| here are our needs, how can you help us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=7189)|
| 1:59:54| So maybe we can do a little more of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=7194)|
| 1:59:57| making it really clear that this is a cost| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=7197)|
| 2:00:00| that we don't have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=7200)|
| 2:00:01| that we don't have any support from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=7201)|
| 2:00:02| It's not coming from the state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=7202)|
| 2:00:04| so that we can get some more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=7204)|
| 2:00:06| I think there are many businesses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=7206)|
| 2:00:08| who would really love to support us more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=7208)|
| 2:00:11| if they knew what our needs were.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=7211)|
| 2:00:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=7214)|
| 2:00:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=7215)|
| 2:00:15| Ms. Bounds, did you have a question, comment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=7215)|
| 2:00:18| No, I just had a suggestion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=7218)|
| 2:00:20| but it kind of followed what you said earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=7220)|
| 2:00:23| So it may not seem as pertinent now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=7223)|
| 2:00:25| but I did want to thank you for putting together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=7225)|
| 2:00:28| that list of like 32 questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=7228)|
| 2:00:30| that community members and board members submitted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=7230)|
| 2:00:34| and the staff for compiling those answers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=7234)|
| 2:00:36| Now, some of those answers may look different| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=7236)|
| 2:00:40| after tonight's discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=7240)|
| 2:00:42| I know Ms. Babb put it on social media| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=7242)|
| 2:00:44| and I know it's attached to the agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=7244)|
| 2:00:47| but I really would hope| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=7247)|
| 2:00:49| if it isn't online on our website| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=7249)|
| 2:00:52| that we would attach the 32 questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=7252)|
| 2:00:56| and the responses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=7256)|
| 2:00:57| because I think it would really help| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=7257)|
| 2:00:59| those in the public to be able to go in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=7259)|
| 2:01:01| and read those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=7261)|
| 2:01:02| And some may go to the agenda to find that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=7262)|
| 2:01:05| but others could access it to the website| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=7265)|
| 2:01:08| if it's not on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=7268)|
| 2:01:12| I saw it on the agenda and that's it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=7272)|
| 2:01:14| but I do think it's a good Q&A for everybody to hear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=7274)|
| 2:01:19| I think so too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=7279)|
| 2:01:20| because that would, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=7280)|

| 2:03:36| to give out at some of our distribution sites.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=7416)|

| 2:03:43| and deliver them to the sites.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=7423)|
| 2:03:45| And everyone was social distancing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=7425)|
| 2:03:47| and wearing masks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=7427)|
| 2:03:48| and there are pictures to prove it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=7428)|

| 2:03:57| who really appreciated that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=7437)|

| 2:04:01| the students appreciated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=7441)|
| 2:04:03| having that little something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=7443)|

| 2:04:36| I think this crisis has made us realize| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=7476)|
| 2:04:39| how much everyone loves their teachers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=7479)|

| 2:05:02| when food and supplies are being given.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=7502)|
| 2:05:06| It's very uplifting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=7506)|
| 2:05:07| to see a lot of the kids smiling faces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=7507)|

| 2:05:20| that they have gone with billboards and signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=7520)|
| 2:05:23| And I know that it's not what it should be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=7523)|
| 2:05:27| but it's a little step in the right direction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=7527)|
| 2:05:31| and look forward to that continuing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=7531)|

| 2:06:02| because of technical problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=7562)|

| 2:06:06| of 25 people without any problems,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=7566)|
| 2:06:09| but this afternoon was a disaster.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=7569)|
| 2:06:12| And also just, what was the other point?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=7572)|

| 2:06:51| to keep in contact with their students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=7611)|
| 2:06:54| and the meal distribution hubs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=7614)|
| 2:06:58| Thank you to our teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=7618)|
| 2:06:59| I know this has not been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=7619)|
| 2:07:00| an ideal Teacher Appreciation Week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=7620)|
| 2:07:02| but we still appreciate you all very much| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=7622)|
| 2:07:05| now more than ever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=7625)|
| 2:07:07| And also to our seniors and senior parents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=7627)|
| 2:07:11| we hear you and just hang in there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=7631)|
| 2:07:15| and please be patient with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=7635)|
| 2:07:16| Hopefully some of this will change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=7636)|
| 2:07:20| Thank you, Ms. Christie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=7640)|
| 2:07:21| Yeah, there's really nothing new| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=7641)|
| 2:07:22| that I can say that hasn't already been said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=7642)|
| 2:07:24| but I just concur with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=7644)|
| 2:07:27| my other fellow board members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=7647)|
| 2:07:28| I'm grateful for our staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=7648)|
| 2:07:31| And truly, as I said before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=7651)|
| 2:07:34| I think that the biggest lesson| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=7654)|
| 2:07:36| that we've seen is just how much| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=7656)|
| 2:07:39| we need our kids in the classroom| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=7659)|
| 2:07:41| and how great the relationships| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=7661)|
| 2:07:44| that those are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=7664)|
| 2:07:45| those relationships the teachers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=7665)|
| 2:07:47| have with our students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=7667)|
| 2:07:48| and how important they are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=7668)|
| 2:07:49| And so thank you to all the staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=7669)|
| 2:07:51| Thank you to the principals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=7671)|
| 2:07:52| and all the nutrition folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=7672)|
| 2:07:54| who've packed up all those 673 bags.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=7674)|
| 2:07:57| I mean, that is a lot of food to pack.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=7677)|
| 2:07:59| So that's very, very time consuming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=7679)|
| 2:08:02| So thank you to all those folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=7682)|
| 2:08:04| who've made that happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=7684)|
| 2:08:06| I think everybody can see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=7686)|
| 2:08:07| from just the discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=7687)|
| 2:08:10| that we've had tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=7690)|
| 2:08:11| how much time and effort| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=7691)|
| 2:08:13| our central office staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=7693)|
| 2:08:16| have been putting in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=7696)|
| 2:08:17| to being able to answer these questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=7697)|
| 2:08:19| that we sent them probably yesterday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=7699)|
| 2:08:22| So they've just been putting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=7702)|
| 2:08:23| in an inordinate amount of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=7703)|
| 2:08:25| We appreciate all that time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=7705)|
| 2:08:26| and effort and energy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=7706)|
| 2:08:28| And the reason they do that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=7708)|
| 2:08:30| is because they love kids| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=7710)|
| 2:08:31| and they all started out in the classroom| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=7711)|
| 2:08:33| and all of the people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=7713)|
| 2:08:37| that are on this board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=7717)|
| 2:08:38| the people that serve in our schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=7718)|
| 2:08:40| in our central office in any capacity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=7720)|
| 2:08:42| are in this business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=7722)|
| 2:08:43| because they love kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=7723)|
| 2:08:45| And so we are all so sad for our seniors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=7725)|
| 2:08:48| that we're not getting to do graduation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=7728)|
| 2:08:51| I mean, Mr. Thomas sits through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=7731)|
| 2:08:53| every single one of those graduations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=7733)|
| 2:08:55| for a solid week every year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=7735)|
| 2:08:57| And even though it's difficult,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=7737)|
| 2:09:00| it is the highlight of his year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=7740)|
| 2:09:01| because he gets to see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=7741)|
| 2:09:02| the end result of all that has happened| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=7742)|
| 2:09:07| for all those years for those students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=7747)|
| 2:09:09| So this is disappointing for everybody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=7749)|
| 2:09:12| and our hearts just go out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=7752)|
| 2:09:14| to all our seniors and families| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=7754)|
| 2:09:15| and just hang in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=7755)|
| 2:09:17| And as Ms. Christie said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=7757)|
| 2:09:18| just be patient and hopefully| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=7758)|
| 2:09:20| we'll be able to have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=7760)|
| 2:09:21| a little more normal graduation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=7761)|
| 2:09:23| than maybe it looks right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=7763)|
| 2:09:26| And so we're just thankful| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=7766)|
| 2:09:29| to be a part of such a great community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=7769)|
| 2:09:32| and we will just continue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=7772)|
| 2:09:34| to do the very best| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=7774)|
| 2:09:34| that we can for our kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=7774)|
| 2:09:36| And I appreciate everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=7776)|
| 2:09:38| Our meeting is now adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=7778)|
| 2:09:39| Thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=7779)|
