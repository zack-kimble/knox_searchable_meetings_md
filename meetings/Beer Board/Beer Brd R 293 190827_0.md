| 0:19:58| We are requesting an extension of 60 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190827?start=1198)|
| 0:20:01| Sixty days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190827?start=1201)|
| 0:20:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190827?start=1202)|
| 0:20:03| Well, I won't take that long, but, you know, construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190827?start=1203)|
| 0:20:06| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190827?start=1206)|
| 0:20:07| I think 60 days is good, so I'll make a motion to defer for 60 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190827?start=1207)|
| 0:20:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190827?start=1211)|

| 0:20:37| Perfect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190827?start=1237)|
| 0:20:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190827?start=1240)|
| 0:20:42| Motion to postpone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190827?start=1242)|
| 0:20:43| Motion to postpone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190827?start=1243)|
| 0:20:45| No, not postpone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190827?start=1245)|
| 0:20:46| To extend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190827?start=1246)|
| 0:20:47| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190827?start=1247)|
| 0:20:48| Motion to extend 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190827?start=1248)|
| 0:20:49| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190827?start=1249)|
| 0:20:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190827?start=1250)|
| 0:20:51| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190827?start=1251)|
| 0:20:52| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190827?start=1252)|
| 0:20:53| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190827?start=1253)|
| 0:20:54| 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190827?start=1254)|
| 0:20:58| True by Hilton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190827?start=1258)|
| 0:21:09| So they were approved on 12-18 at 18 and extended in March, extended again in June.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190827?start=1269)|
| 0:21:20| And they were noticed that they needed to be here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190827?start=1280)|
| 0:21:23| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190827?start=1283)|
| 0:21:27| I was going to say, that's the one that came from the signed variance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190827?start=1287)|
| 0:21:30| Yes, that's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190827?start=1290)|
| 0:21:33| So we can extend it again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190827?start=1293)|
| 0:21:36| It's in Mark's district, so that's close to your district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190827?start=1296)|
| 0:21:40| Close.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190827?start=1300)|
| 0:21:42| Bouncing it across the line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190827?start=1302)|
| 0:21:43| I'm bouncing it to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190827?start=1303)|
| 0:21:44| Let me measure how many feet away it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190827?start=1304)|
| 0:21:46| We can extend it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190827?start=1306)|
| 0:21:47| We extended 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190827?start=1307)|
| 0:21:49| If we don't extend it, they've got to reapply.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190827?start=1309)|
| 0:21:51| That's where we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190827?start=1311)|
| 0:21:52| Is this their first extension?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190827?start=1312)|
| 0:21:53| No, this will be their third extension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190827?start=1313)|
| 0:21:55| Is it shown for the other meetings?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190827?start=1315)|
| 0:21:57| Probably.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190827?start=1317)|
| 0:21:59| I don't know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190827?start=1319)|
| 0:22:00| I believe so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190827?start=1320)|
| 0:22:01| This is the first time they've no-showed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190827?start=1321)|
| 0:22:03| I think that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190827?start=1323)|
| 0:22:07| We have 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190827?start=1327)|
| 0:22:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190827?start=1328)|
| 0:22:09| I'm going to make a motion to delay, defer for 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190827?start=1329)|
| 0:22:12| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190827?start=1332)|
| 0:22:13| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190827?start=1333)|
| 0:22:16| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190827?start=1336)|
| 0:22:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190827?start=1337)|
| 0:22:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190827?start=1339)|
| 0:22:20| We have one administrative hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190827?start=1340)|
| 0:22:23| DW Restaurant Holder, LLC, doing business as Hooters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190827?start=1343)|
| 0:22:34| Afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190827?start=1354)|
| 0:22:36| Ben Mullins, 550 West Main Street, here for DW Holding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190827?start=1356)|
| 0:22:40| I have Joshua Braxton, who is the regional manager for the restaurant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190827?start=1360)|
| 0:22:45| and Justin Collins here, who is the bar manager at this particular location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190827?start=1365)|
| 0:22:52| We have, I believe, submitted all the paperwork required, the $500 fine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190827?start=1372)|
| 0:22:58| and the plan of remedial action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190827?start=1378)|
| 0:23:02| In fact, that was, I believe, supplemented about three days after it was initially provided.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190827?start=1382)|
| 0:23:07| I do have some additional documentation that is referred to during the remedial plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190827?start=1387)|
| 0:23:14| that I would like to pass out is actually just the checklist that every employee is required to sign| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190827?start=1394)|
| 0:23:22| at every shift going over their requirements as to responsible alcohol service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190827?start=1402)|
| 0:23:28| So that is referred to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190827?start=1408)|
| 0:23:31| If you look at 308, there is a number 12.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190827?start=1411)|
| 0:23:39| There is a form that they're required to sign at every shift, and I actually have a copy of that form.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190827?start=1419)|
| 0:23:45| It was not provided previously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190827?start=1425)|
| 0:23:46| If I could pass that to the city recorder, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190827?start=1426)|
| 0:23:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190827?start=1429)|
| 0:24:06| So where we are on this is that you were cited for sale to a minor in July of 18,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190827?start=1446)|
| 0:24:12| received a remedial plan in August, cited again for sale to a minor in July of 19,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190827?start=1452)|
| 0:24:21| the second in a two-year period, notice of administrative hearing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190827?start=1461)|
| 0:24:28| you received a remedial plan, you paid the $500 fine,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190827?start=1468)|
| 0:24:33| and then the revised remedial plan that's attached.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190827?start=1473)|
| 0:24:36| So our business here is whether, one, to accept it as submitted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190827?start=1476)|
| 0:24:43| or refer him back to the hearing officer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190827?start=1483)|
| 0:24:48| Just a couple questions for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190827?start=1488)|
| 0:24:51| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190827?start=1491)|
| 0:24:52| Can you talk to us a little bit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190827?start=1492)|
| 0:24:54| I've looked through your remedial plan, and I've got the supplement that you've given us here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190827?start=1494)|
| 0:25:00| Can you tell us a little bit about, you know, what you're going to be doing differently now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190827?start=1500)|
| 0:25:05| You've had, you know, as the chairman was saying, we had sale in 18 in July,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190827?start=1505)|
| 0:25:11| sale in 19 just a little bit more than a year after that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190827?start=1511)|
| 0:25:16| Can you talk to us a little bit about what you're doing differently now based on this new submitted plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190827?start=1516)|
| 0:25:23| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190827?start=1523)|
| 0:25:24| And if I could let Mr. Braxton refer to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190827?start=1524)|
| 0:25:29| Joshua Braxton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190827?start=1529)|
| 0:25:33| The remedial plan that we submitted in 2018, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190827?start=1533)|
| 0:25:38| included about half of the bullet points that we submitted a couple weeks ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190827?start=1538)|
| 0:25:44| And our biggest failure, and we had talked about this beforehand,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190827?start=1544)|
| 0:25:51| we just failed to adequately train this team member, and we were going about it the wrong way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190827?start=1551)|
| 0:25:57| both as a restaurant and probably as a-I don't think it was exclusive to this one person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190827?start=1557)|
| 0:26:04| This obviously highlighted opportunities that we had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190827?start=1564)|
| 0:26:07| So some of the key takeaways from this event to try and help us not just prevent this in the future| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190827?start=1567)|
| 0:26:13| but also be more responsible with alcohol service is the pre-shift meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190827?start=1573)|
| 0:26:19| We have that for every team member who works in the restaurant every shift twice a day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190827?start=1579)|
| 0:26:25| and every team member signs off on that conversation that we have, which I think is what's in front of you all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190827?start=1585)|
| 0:26:31| where if nothing else it makes sure that it's treated with the level of importance that it deserves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190827?start=1591)|
| 0:26:38| And we're signing off saying that we had this conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190827?start=1598)|
| 0:26:42| And obviously in restaurants we can get distracted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190827?start=1602)|
| 0:26:44| We may miss something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190827?start=1604)|
| 0:26:46| This is something that we can't afford to miss.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190827?start=1606)|
| 0:26:49| So that's why we instituted that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190827?start=1609)|
| 0:26:51| We've also instituted additional training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190827?start=1611)|
| 0:26:55| In addition to TABC, we're requiring all of our team members to take Serve Safe Alcohol,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190827?start=1615)|
| 0:26:59| which is an NRA-accredited program nationwide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190827?start=1619)|
| 0:27:04| We're teaching that in person at a cost to the restaurant for every team member, actually in the state of Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190827?start=1624)|
| 0:27:10| not just exclusive to our Knoxville market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190827?start=1630)|
| 0:27:14| And then furthermore, we've instituted a policy as a brand that if we receive an under-21 ID,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190827?start=1634)|
| 0:27:24| that the team member would involve the manager in that process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190827?start=1644)|
| 0:27:27| and they would actually bring that ID to the manager on duty to have it scanned using an ID scanner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190827?start=1647)|
| 0:27:33| to kind of share the responsibility and help coach in real time how we read an ID, verify it, and make sure that it's accurate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190827?start=1653)|
| 0:27:41| So those are a few of the things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190827?start=1661)|
| 0:27:43| Those are the big ones on the plan that are different from the previous plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190827?start=1663)|
| 0:27:47| And we've seen our success rate go up with training and our employee retention| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190827?start=1667)|
| 0:27:54| of kind of some of our best practices and policies around our Responsible Alcohol Service platform.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190827?start=1674)|
| 0:28:00| Did I see in the plan that I think you had kind of secret shopper type things where you were testing now as well?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190827?start=1680)|
| 0:28:08| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190827?start=1688)|
| 0:28:09| So that's twofold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190827?start=1689)|
| 0:28:11| One is the BARS program, which is a nationally recognized program that, as a company,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190827?start=1691)|
| 0:28:16| we hire an external company to come in and validate that our team members are asking for ID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190827?start=1696)|
| 0:28:23| Actually, since this occurred, we've had all three stores in the Knoxville market and Alcoa have been visited by BARS,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190827?start=1703)|
| 0:28:32| and we successfully passed all three of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190827?start=1712)|
| 0:28:35| So we think that that has helped raise awareness around asking for IDs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190827?start=1715)|
| 0:28:40| And then the other part of that is an internal mystery shop program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190827?start=1720)|
| 0:28:45| That's not something that we were doing as a concept before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190827?start=1725)|
| 0:28:49| and we thought that it was important to kind of self-audit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190827?start=1729)|
| 0:28:55| and we actually sent out the final plans for that this week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190827?start=1735)|
| 0:28:59| And on our end, we're making sure that any human resources concerns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190827?start=1739)|
| 0:29:03| or legal concerns on our part have been addressed, and our plan is to go live with that on Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190827?start=1743)|
| 0:29:09| And that will be something that we do not just in the Knoxville market,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190827?start=1749)|
| 0:29:13| but actually the entire state of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190827?start=1753)|
| 0:29:15| We're rolling that out to all of our stores in the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190827?start=1755)|
| 0:29:20| I appreciate the detailed review and the things that you've told us that you're implementing now and doing differently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190827?start=1760)|
| 0:29:29| It definitely sounds like you're taking this very seriously, which you should.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190827?start=1769)|
| 0:29:35| Mr. Frost, just so I know, we have the option to, I guess, do nothing or send them for a hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190827?start=1775)|
| 0:29:43| Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190827?start=1783)|
| 0:29:44| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190827?start=1784)|
| 0:29:45| And they have, if they have another underage sale in the next two years?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190827?start=1785)|
| 0:29:51| It's a rolling two-year period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190827?start=1791)|
| 0:29:54| So if they, I don't recall when their first occurrence happened,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190827?start=1794)|
| 0:29:58| but let's just say they go out and pick up a third one next week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190827?start=1798)|
| 0:30:01| they will automatically go to the hearing officer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190827?start=1801)|
| 0:30:04| They will not come to the beer fight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190827?start=1804)|
| 0:30:07| They'll go straight there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190827?start=1807)|
| 0:30:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190827?start=1808)|
| 0:30:09| Well, I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190827?start=1809)|
| 0:30:10| I know other members have questions for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190827?start=1810)|
| 0:30:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190827?start=1813)|
| 0:30:14| I just have two questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190827?start=1814)|
| 0:30:15| One, the sheet that you have them sign, is this new since this happened?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190827?start=1815)|
| 0:30:20| Yes, it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190827?start=1820)|
| 0:30:21| It has been revised even last week with these policies that since this has occurred,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190827?start=1821)|
| 0:30:29| and looking back and revisiting this, we wanted to make sure that we were as comprehensive as we could,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190827?start=1829)|
| 0:30:35| and this is something that is being implemented at this location now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190827?start=1835)|
| 0:30:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190827?start=1839)|
| 0:30:40| The second question was I didn't quite follow what you were saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190827?start=1840)|
| 0:30:42| If an ID is under 21, then you verify it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190827?start=1842)|
| 0:30:46| Actually, I wanted to clarify that a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190827?start=1846)|
| 0:30:49| The policy has been, you know, if you have an under 21 ID, it doesn't mean that they're under 21.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190827?start=1849)|
| 0:30:56| It can mean that they got the ID when they were under 21, but they might still be older now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190827?start=1856)|
| 0:31:02| and you can still be eligible to drink.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190827?start=1862)|
| 0:31:04| So the plan is to take that ID and you actually have a scanner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190827?start=1864)|
| 0:31:07| You can verify the age.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190827?start=1867)|
| 0:31:09| And it's our policy to take every under 21 ID to the manager| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190827?start=1869)|
| 0:31:13| and have the manager involved in that process as well and not just the server.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190827?start=1873)|
| 0:31:18| In addition to that, and something that's not on the plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190827?start=1878)|
| 0:31:20| but something that we're implementing now at this location,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190827?start=1880)|
| 0:31:23| we're taking every ID to the scanner, whether it's under 21 or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190827?start=1883)|
| 0:31:27| Only the under 21 IDs are the ones that we're also involving the manager in the process as well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190827?start=1887)|
| 0:31:32| to make sure nothing slips through the cracks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190827?start=1892)|
| 0:31:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190827?start=1894)|
| 0:31:40| I just wanted to go back to your list of remedial measures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190827?start=1900)|
| 0:31:43| Number 10, you have train all staff on the red box carding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190827?start=1903)|
| 0:31:47| Has that already been completed or is that in process?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190827?start=1907)|
| 0:31:51| They were trained previously, but we're implementing additional training| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190827?start=1911)|
| 0:31:54| in addition to the measures I just talked about with Councilwoman Singh| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190827?start=1914)|
| 0:31:57| about taking that and making sure the manager is involved in the scanning of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190827?start=1917)|
| 0:32:02| It was something that we had done before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190827?start=1922)|
| 0:32:05| Obviously we didn't do it as effectively as we should have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190827?start=1925)|
| 0:32:09| so we looked at what did we do wrong, what can we do better,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190827?start=1929)|
| 0:32:13| and we are now incorporating that into our new training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190827?start=1933)|
| 0:32:16| In fact, we've had online training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190827?start=1936)|
| 0:32:20| They get e-mails, they log in, and they actually do testing and training as they go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190827?start=1940)|
| 0:32:25| in addition to live training, which we have in the region,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190827?start=1945)|
| 0:32:29| training coming on September 8, September 14, and September 21,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190827?start=1949)|
| 0:32:33| which will incorporate these new measures that we've put into place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190827?start=1953)|
| 0:32:36| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190827?start=1956)|
| 0:32:37| One last question, and my apologies if I overlooked it if it's here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190827?start=1957)|
| 0:32:40| but what was the tenure of the employee that sold to the underage?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190827?start=1960)|
| 0:32:44| She had been employed for 59 days under the TBAC program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190827?start=1964)|
| 0:32:49| She's not required to be certified until she's been employed for 61 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190827?start=1969)|
| 0:32:54| So she had received some internal training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190827?start=1974)|
| 0:32:56| Obviously we didn't do a good enough job training her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190827?start=1976)|
| 0:32:59| She actually did check the ID but did not take it back to either confirm it with the manager| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190827?start=1979)|
| 0:33:05| or to check it with the born on date, tried to do the math in the head,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190827?start=1985)|
| 0:33:09| and you know, math drove me to law school if we're trying to do math in our head,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190827?start=1989)|
| 0:33:13| especially if you're doing a job as, you know, as hectic as serving can be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190827?start=1993)|
| 0:33:17| then, you know, she missed it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190827?start=1997)|
| 0:33:19| She shouldn't have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190827?start=1999)|
| 0:33:20| She should have taken it back, and she was terminated because of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190827?start=2000)|
| 0:33:23| which is a policy we've had in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190827?start=2003)|
| 0:33:25| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190827?start=2005)|
| 0:33:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190827?start=2006)|
| 0:33:28| I'd say given the thorough nature of their report to us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190827?start=2008)|
| 0:33:33| the amount of honesty that they've brought to us about, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190827?start=2013)|
| 0:33:38| issues that they felt like they needed to improve on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190827?start=2018)|
| 0:33:42| I'd say I wouldn't recommend taking any further action, so I'd just leave it alone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190827?start=2022)|
| 0:33:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190827?start=2027)|
| 0:33:49| Everybody nodding in agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190827?start=2029)|
| 0:33:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190827?start=2030)|
| 0:33:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190827?start=2031)|
| 0:33:53| You're good to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190827?start=2033)|
| 0:33:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190827?start=2034)|
| 0:33:57| Last call for the mystic mule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190827?start=2037)|
| 0:34:04| Last call for the mystic mule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190827?start=2044)|
| 0:34:10| Do you want to postpone it for 30 days?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190827?start=2050)|
| 0:34:11| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190827?start=2051)|
| 0:34:12| I'll make a motion to postpone for 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190827?start=2052)|
| 0:34:14| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190827?start=2054)|
| 0:34:15| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190827?start=2055)|
| 0:34:16| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190827?start=2056)|
| 0:34:17| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190827?start=2057)|
| 0:34:18| Thank you, and the meeting is adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190827?start=2058)|
