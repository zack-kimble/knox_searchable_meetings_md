| 0:07:48| I've been on the phone with my in-laws, and some of you have been in the political arena very long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=468)|
| 0:07:56| You may remember, as Michelle said, my father-in-law was Tom Jensen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=476)|
| 0:07:59| He was state representative a few hundred years ago back in the day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=479)|
| 0:08:03| Anyway, he is probably in his last days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=483)|
| 0:08:07| I do covet your prayers for my father-in-law and my mother-in-law, Tom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=487)|
| 0:08:14| I want to read one scripture and then share just a little bit, and I'll get out of y'all's way and let you get to work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=494)|
| 0:08:20| It's Isaiah 40, 31.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=500)|
| 0:08:22| Those who hope in the Lord will renew their strength.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=502)|
| 0:08:25| They will soar on wings like eagles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=505)|
| 0:08:27| They will run and not grow weary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=507)|
| 0:08:29| They will walk and not be faint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=509)|
| 0:08:32| I certainly encourage that to my church, that we would do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=512)|
| 0:08:36| I certainly encourage that to you as commissioners in your job and in your world,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=516)|
| 0:08:43| that if we would all put our strength in the Lord, renew our strength in the Lord, that we can soar with wings like eagles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=523)|
| 0:08:51| We can run.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=531)|
| 0:08:52| Sometimes we kind of run together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=532)|
| 0:08:54| Sometimes we run a little bit separately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=534)|
| 0:08:56| But hopefully we're getting toward the same direction and wanting the same things, and we will walk together and not be faint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=536)|
| 0:09:02| Part of the reason I thought about this verse is just a few days ago I got back from Guatemala.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=542)|
| 0:09:08| The government in Guatemala is a little bit different than, I think, the way they run things in the United States.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=548)|
| 0:09:14| You probably remember the volcano that happened a month or two ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=554)|
| 0:09:21| What we found out was the ones that were warned as best they could be about the earthquake and all the lava and everything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=561)|
| 0:09:38| the ones that were warned were pretty much the haves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=578)|
| 0:09:41| They warned the folks at the fancy hotels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=581)|
| 0:09:43| They warned the ones at the country clubs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=583)|
| 0:09:47| They warned the ones on the golf course and places like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=587)|
| 0:09:52| And those that were living in the villages in the very poor, pitiful situations received no warning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=592)|
| 0:10:01| And the last day of our mission trip, when we were over close to where the volcano was, we would talk with them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=601)|
| 0:10:08| and I'd say, I'm very sorry for what's happened in your community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=608)|
| 0:10:12| We want to pray for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=612)|
| 0:10:13| God cares for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=613)|
| 0:10:15| And on one occasion, due to not receiving much of a warning, one young lady let us know that she lost 28 family members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=615)|
| 0:10:25| One young lady let us know that she lost 10 or 12 family members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=625)|
| 0:10:30| Someone else lost 8 to 10 family members just due to the fact that they weren't able to get together with everyone on the same page| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=630)|
| 0:10:39| to let them know about the impending trouble that was coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=639)|
| 0:10:44| And so it's like, man, you hope everybody's on the same page and everyone's on equal ground| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=644)|
| 0:10:50| and that we carry on with integrity and honor and like I know that we will do that here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=650)|
| 0:10:58| And God bless you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=658)|
| 0:10:59| It was an honor for me to be here, and I want us to have a word of prayer and on with the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=659)|
| 0:11:04| Okay, God, thank you for loving us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=664)|
| 0:11:06| Thank you for this time, for these commissioners and their work and their ministry and their communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=666)|
| 0:11:12| And Lord, I know you can't do it in the church, and you're certainly not going to do it in the political arena,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=672)|
| 0:11:18| that everybody agree, but I know we can all agree to disagree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=678)|
| 0:11:23| We can all get along.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=683)|
| 0:11:24| And I know one thing, whether you're Republican, Democrat, white, black, independent, whatever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=684)|
| 0:11:29| I know that you love us, and I know Jesus loves us, and he died on the cross for our sins,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=689)|
| 0:11:33| and I thank you for that, and I thank you for eternal life we have in knowing you as our Savior.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=693)|
| 0:11:38| And I bless this meeting and those who are part in Jesus' name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=698)|
| 0:11:41| Amen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=701)|
| 0:11:42| Thank you for allowing me to come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=702)|
| 0:11:44| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=704)|
| 0:11:49| Commissioner Thomas, will you lead us in the pledge, sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=709)|
| 0:11:51| Yes, and as we stand, somebody reminded me a couple of months ago that the United States of America,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=711)|
| 0:11:57| we salute and sing in ceremony to our country's flag more than any other country in the world.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=717)|
| 0:12:04| And that really stuck with me, and I'm proud that we do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=724)|
| 0:12:08| and that may be part of the reason we are such a great country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=728)|
| 0:12:11| So if you'll please stand, put your hand over your heart, or salute your flag.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=731)|
| 0:12:16| I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=736)|
| 0:12:21| and to the republic for which it stands, one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=741)|
| 0:12:38| Okay, before we get started, I want to acknowledge some people that are in the audience tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=758)|
| 0:12:42| We have Mayor Tim Burchett here, Superintendent Bob Thomas, Criminal Court Clerk Mike Hammond,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=762)|
| 0:12:48| and Trustee Ed Schaus, and I'm going to turn it over to my fellow Commissioner John Schoomaker| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=768)|
| 0:12:53| to introduce the delegation of legislators from the Town of Farragut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=773)|
| 0:12:57| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=777)|
| 0:12:59| Joining us from the Town of Farragut tonight, if you would please stand and remain standing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=779)|
| 0:13:03| is the Town Mayor Ron Pinchok.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=783)|
| 0:13:07| We have Alderman Ron Williams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=787)|
| 0:13:11| Alderman Louise Pavlin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=791)|
| 0:13:15| We have the Town Administrator David Smoke.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=795)|
| 0:13:19| We have the Director of Farragut's Parks and Recreation Department, Sue Stahl.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=799)|
| 0:13:26| And of course, we have Jim Nixon, who has been a real advocate for the Town of Farragut for 20-something years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=806)|
| 0:13:34| So we appreciate you joining us this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=814)|
| 0:13:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=818)|
| 0:13:45| Okay, it's time for public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=825)|
| 0:13:48| Is David McCroskey here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=828)|
| 0:13:52| David McCroskey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=832)|
| 0:13:59| Kim Frazier?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=839)|
| 0:14:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=843)|
| 0:14:06| Madam Clerk?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=846)|
| 0:14:13| Has everybody had a chance to look over the minutes from the last meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=853)|
| 0:14:18| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=858)|
| 0:14:20| Opposed say no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=860)|
| 0:14:21| The motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=861)|
| 0:14:23| Mr. Chair, in recognition of people visiting with us from the City of Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=863)|
| 0:14:28| City Councilwoman Stephanie Welch is hiding in the curtains.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=868)|
| 0:14:33| She is hiding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=873)|
| 0:14:40| Commissioner Carringer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=880)|
| 0:14:43| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=883)|
| 0:14:45| I have a little special presentation in case the rest of our County Commissioners hadn't heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=885)|
| 0:14:53| And we were blessed to have Ms. Stephanie Welch with the City join us that day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=893)|
| 0:14:58| I don't know where the rest of your partners are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=898)|
| 0:15:01| but Andrew Roberto and I serve in the North Knoxville Business and Professional Association,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=901)|
| 0:15:09| and they were promoting men's health back in July| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=909)|
| 0:15:14| and asked that City Council and County Commission challenge each other in putt-putting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=914)|
| 0:15:19| So I had my County Commission team, which consisted of Evelyn Gill, myself, Hugh Nystrom, and John Schoomaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=919)|
| 0:15:30| And Stephanie was one of the ones that played on City Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=930)|
| 0:15:34| And we did not know this at all, but they presented us all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=934)|
| 0:15:40| Stand up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=940)|
| 0:15:43| Evelyn didn't get her email last night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=943)|
| 0:15:47| But we were all presented medals for beating City Council in putt-putt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=947)|
| 0:15:55| So I just wanted to let everybody know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=955)|
| 0:15:59| We wanted to see if Mr. Steeley would take a picture of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=959)|
| 0:16:01| We need to get closer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=961)|
| 0:16:03| Gather here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=963)|
| 0:16:04| Come on here, Evelyn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=964)|
| 0:16:06| Look here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=966)|
| 0:16:07| Left my medal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=967)|
| 0:16:14| And that, ladies and gentlemen, is our putt-putt dream team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=974)|
| 0:16:19| Hey, any time you can beat City Council is pretty good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=979)|
| 0:16:22| John brought his own putter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=982)|
| 0:16:27| Told to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=987)|
| 0:16:29| And I just wanted to add that City Council and County Commission, we were all good sports about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=989)|
| 0:16:35| It was a lot of fun because we were also promoting a very good cause of men's health in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=995)|
| 0:16:42| And we were totally surprised that they had gotten medals for all of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=1002)|
| 0:16:47| So this will probably be our only dream adventure there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=1007)|
| 0:16:51| But anyway, we'll take it while we've got it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=1011)|
| 0:16:53| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=1013)|
| 0:16:54| I went to the City Council meeting where they honored Lynn Redman, and they were still bragging about bowling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=1014)|
| 0:17:00| Oh, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=1020)|
| 0:17:01| And the thing that they leave out was I was the only County Commissioner on our team because there were conflicts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=1021)|
| 0:17:08| But this time we had four County Commissioners, so we did it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=1028)|
| 0:17:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=1035)|
| 0:17:16| Good job, guys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=1036)|
| 0:17:18| We're on to approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=1038)|

| 0:17:25| That would be item 59, item 60, 76, and 77.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=1045)|
| 0:17:36| Commissioner Skidmark?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=1056)|
| 0:17:38| Add those and then move it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=1058)|
| 0:17:40| I'm going to do that in the consent part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=1060)|
| 0:17:47| 59, 60, 76, and 77.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=1067)|
| 0:17:55| Any other items to be added?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=1075)|
| 0:17:58| I need a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=1078)|
| 0:17:59| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=1079)|
| 0:18:00| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=1080)|
| 0:18:01| Okay, with a proper motion and a second, all in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=1081)|
| 0:18:03| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=1083)|
| 0:18:04| Opposed say no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=1084)|
| 0:18:05| The motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=1085)|
| 0:18:07| I have no items to be withdrawn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=1087)|
| 0:18:09| Are there any items that need to be withdrawn from department heads?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=1089)|

| 0:19:58| Do you want it pulled off?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=1198)|
| 0:20:00| Well, it's not asterisked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=1200)|
| 0:20:02| It's to be discussed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=1202)|
| 0:20:14| That item should be on consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=1214)|
| 0:20:18| Let me talk about it anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=1218)|

| 0:20:48| I had spoken to Drew about this item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=1248)|
| 0:20:56| An absent vote does not keep something off consent, but you wish for it to come off anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=1256)|
| 0:21:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=1262)|

| 0:22:33| Commissioner Gill passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=1353)|
| 0:22:36| Madam Clerk, next item please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=1356)|
| 0:22:41| Line item transfers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=1361)|
| 0:22:45| Do I have a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=1365)|
| 0:22:47| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=1367)|
| 0:22:48| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=1368)|
| 0:22:50| Director Caldwell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=1370)|
| 0:23:04| Just in general, is that what you want?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=1384)|
| 0:23:08| In general, so what we're doing here, you've got a lot of line items from Fund 171,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=1388)|
| 0:23:13| which is our public improvement fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=1393)|
| 0:23:15| And so we chose to do these this month instead of August,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=1395)|
| 0:23:19| because we're going to receive a whole lot more line item transfers in August| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=1399)|
| 0:23:23| that are due to just cleaning up negative balances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=1403)|
| 0:23:26| because our charter and code say that we can't have a negative balance in our major funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=1406)|
| 0:23:33| So you're going to see a lot more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=1413)|
| 0:23:35| These are basically scrubbing our capital projects from a litany,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=1415)|
| 0:23:41| from I guess a number of years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=1421)|
| 0:23:43| to close out some projects that have been left open with a balance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=1423)|
| 0:23:47| And we use those balances to cover net negative balances in other projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=1427)|
| 0:23:53| And so on page one, basically all we're doing there is we're closing some buildings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=1433)|
| 0:23:59| from the ACC History Center renovation to John Tarleton Home to Health Department, things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=1439)|
| 0:24:05| We're taking that money and moving it to close projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=1445)|
| 0:24:08| And in other cases, like on page two,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=1448)|
| 0:24:12| we're using some monies that were never spent in capital outlay under animal welfare| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=1452)|
| 0:24:18| to pay for the trustees' commission, which is charged to this fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=1458)|
| 0:24:23| Other things, like on that page, the next two pieces is Seven Island Footbridge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=1463)|
| 0:24:27| which is a grant that we applied for many years ago, appropriated the county match,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=1467)|
| 0:24:36| but never spent anything, never got the grant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=1476)|
| 0:24:38| So we're using some of that monies to cover debt issuance costs and things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=1478)|
| 0:24:43| And so this is what you see here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=1483)|
| 0:24:48| Page three, you're going to see we're combining a couple of org codes instead of having them separate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=1488)|
| 0:24:54| Same thing on page four, you've got the Seven Island Footbridge grant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=1494)|
| 0:25:00| which is the county portion of our match that's clearing some negative balances on Halls Greenway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=1500)|
| 0:25:06| Carter Senior Center, Strang Senior Center, some old projects that still had a negative balance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=1506)|
| 0:25:14| We're just aligning budget with expense down there as it's related to Carter School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=1514)|
| 0:25:20| Next page is we're breaking out a project into two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=1520)|
| 0:25:24| The final page I think that you were going to ask about basically is taking some closed projects| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=1524)|
| 0:25:32| with remaining balances, like from Knob Creek Bridge to Bob Gray Roundabout level road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=1532)|
| 0:25:40| and putting that toward the additional expenses that we had towards our forensic center back a few years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=1540)|
| 0:25:47| So we're cleaning those up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=1547)|
| 0:25:49| We have, if you've served on investment committee through the trustee's office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=1549)|
| 0:25:54| you will know that we have spent down requirements on grants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=1554)|
| 0:25:57| And so while a lot of the departments, they're probably going to throw stones at me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=1557)|
| 0:26:01| they would like to think they could keep that money forever and never spend it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=1561)|
| 0:26:05| There comes a period of time when we want to pull that back and use it for other projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=1565)|
| 0:26:08| And so this is what this is doing, is cleaning a lot of that up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=1568)|
| 0:26:11| And you'll see more of that in our operating funds next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=1571)|
| 0:26:15| Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=1575)|
| 0:26:16| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=1576)|
| 0:26:17| So in other words, the first eight pages, that's where we get the $7.4 million?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=1577)|
| 0:26:22| Correct. Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=1582)|
| 0:26:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=1583)|
| 0:26:24| Basically it's not new, it's just transferring around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=1584)|
| 0:26:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=1586)|
| 0:26:29| Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=1589)|
| 0:26:30| The reason I pulled it off last time was in general in the past this has been by department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=1590)|
| 0:26:38| I think this, me and Chris had a meeting and talked about it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=1598)|
| 0:26:40| but I'd like to see a little bit more detail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=1600)|

| 0:35:41| and lease of property located at 239 Jamestown Boulevard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=2141)|
| 0:35:45| for use of a portion of the property by Knox County as a senior center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=2145)|
| 0:35:49| This is resolution 905.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=2149)|
| 0:35:51| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=2151)|
| 0:35:53| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=2153)|
| 0:35:54| Mr. Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=2154)|
| 0:35:55| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=2155)|
| 0:35:58| This is a great opportunity now for Knox County to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=2158)|
| 0:36:02| just the second time in 38 years, to do a partnership with the Town of Farragut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=2162)|
| 0:36:08| As most of you are aware, it's been a long process trying to find a location| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=2168)|
| 0:36:13| for our seniors in West Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=2173)|
| 0:36:16| because the current facility has no parking, basically,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=2176)|
| 0:36:21| and the facility is not large enough to handle the needs for our seniors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=2181)|
| 0:36:25| So this has been a great opportunity to partner with the Town of Farragut,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=2185)|
| 0:36:31| being able to lease a building that they're going to purchase,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=2191)|
| 0:36:36| and we'll be able to put our senior center there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=2196)|
| 0:36:41| Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=2201)|
| 0:36:42| One question I had, I don't know if it's for Matt or for I guess anybody,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=2202)|
| 0:36:46| is the senior center alone going over there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=2206)|
| 0:36:48| or the trustee's office, the clerk's office, and everything else going over there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=2208)|
| 0:36:54| Our initial thought is just the senior center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=2214)|
| 0:36:57| and so I know the Town of Farragut, I don't want to speak for them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=2217)|
| 0:36:59| but they're going to put some of their offices over there as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=2219)|
| 0:37:02| So there will be offices there, but for us it's a senior center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=2222)|
| 0:37:06| I just had that question earlier. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=2226)|
| 0:37:08| Chris, I have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=2228)|
| 0:37:10| We're going to sell our current center, and do we have an appraisal value on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=2230)|
| 0:37:14| what we expect to receive for the sale of it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=2234)|
| 0:37:18| We don't have the appraisal yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=2238)|
| 0:37:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=2240)|
| 0:37:21| And the difference between what we sell and the $2 million we'll need to invest in this new building will be made up how?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=2241)|
| 0:37:27| You'll see it next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=2247)|
| 0:37:30| It's going to be through designations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=2250)|
| 0:37:34| We got hall income tax in last week and got like $3.9 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=2254)|
| 0:37:42| And we budgeted $1.8 million?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=2262)|
| 0:37:44| $1.6 million. Perry owes me dinner or lunch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=2264)|
| 0:37:48| He was wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=2268)|
| 0:37:50| I want that for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=2270)|
| 0:37:52| He's happy he's wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=2272)|
| 0:37:54| So what you'll see is a difference between.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=2274)|
| 0:37:57| So we had money in the capital plan, I think, for $750,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=2277)|
| 0:38:01| Whatever we sell the other for, then the difference will make up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=2281)|
| 0:38:06| We're fortunate in our capital improvement plan that we don't have a cash flow issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=2286)|
| 0:38:11| so we can kind of go along until we find out what that exact amount is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=2291)|
| 0:38:16| Commissioner Brantley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=2296)|
| 0:38:17| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=2297)|
| 0:38:18| I commend John and the folks at Farragut, Jim Nixon, and all you nice folks for doing this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=2298)|
| 0:38:23| This is one of the things of going around West Knox County, this is what everybody's been asking for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=2303)|
| 0:38:29| And finally, we've got it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=2309)|
| 0:38:31| So I urge my fellow commissioners to vote aye, and let's get this thing done and get it underway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=2311)|
| 0:38:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=2318)|
| 0:38:39| Yes, I'd also like to thank Commissioner Schoomaker for all his hard work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=2319)|
| 0:38:43| This is one of the things when he first got on commission he set out to do, and it looks like he's going to get there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=2323)|
| 0:38:48| And also thank the town of Farragut and Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=2328)|
| 0:38:52| I am a person that always likes to see joint cooperations between our municipalities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=2332)|
| 0:38:57| It usually works out best for everybody when we all work together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=2337)|
| 0:39:01| I would say the mayor charged me with trying to get this to work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=2341)|
| 0:39:06| and David Smoak, the county administrator, and I met at lunch, I think at Cheddar's, for the first time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=2346)|
| 0:39:12| And it kind of just worked, and we had an idea of what we wanted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=2352)|
| 0:39:15| and went back to the mayor and told him what we thought would work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=2355)|
| 0:39:19| and he was all on board and then got with Commissioner Schoomaker and it just rolled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=2359)|
| 0:39:23| So it's been a really good partnership, and I think the MOU as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=2363)|
| 0:39:27| We didn't want to get it too detailed, but I think it's what it needs to be with a bright future ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=2367)|
| 0:39:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=2374)|
| 0:39:35| Commissioner Schoomaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=2375)|
| 0:39:36| Just to make one final comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=2376)|
| 0:39:38| I do appreciate Mayor Burchett's effort on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=2378)|
| 0:39:41| I know that when he would come and do public events in my district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=2381)|
| 0:39:45| he felt like every time he showed up I had my foot on his throat and talking about a new senior center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=2385)|
| 0:39:52| But I do appreciate everybody from the county side, their efforts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=2392)|
| 0:39:57| from procurement, from finance, and from your staff as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=2397)|
| 0:40:01| And I'm also very, very thankful to the town of Farragut and the leadership there that they provided| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=2401)|
| 0:40:08| so we can bring this opportunity to fruition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=2408)|
| 0:40:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=2412)|
| 0:40:15| Is there any further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=2415)|

| 0:54:15| and the Health Educational and Housing Facility Board of the County of Knox.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=3255)|
| 0:54:19| This is Resolution 110.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=3259)|
| 0:54:22| Just to briefly summarize how we'll do this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=3262)|
| 0:54:24| because it's been a while since we've filled this many seats on one board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=3264)|
| 0:54:27| we will accept nominations for each blank.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=3267)|
| 0:54:32| Once we have nominations set for the first blank, we'll vote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=3272)|
| 0:54:35| and whoever gets six first will fill that blank.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=3275)|
| 0:54:38| We'll move to the second blank, take nominations, vote until somebody gets six.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=3278)|
| 0:54:44| Then we'll move to the third one, the final spot, take nominations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=3284)|
| 0:54:48| whoever gets six, then we'll vote to put all three names in the blanks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=3288)|
| 0:54:52| and then we'll vote on the resolutions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=3292)|
| 0:54:57| We'll start with nominations in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=3297)|
| 0:54:59| Can we, Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=3299)|
| 0:55:04| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=3304)|
| 0:55:06| Can we have the IDB Board representative come to the microphone for just a minute?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=3306)|
| 0:55:12| I want to clarify something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=3312)|
| 0:55:16| Todd Napier, 17 Market Square, Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=3316)|
| 0:55:23| The two people that have already served on the board, Mr. Coleman and Mr. Fortunato,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=3323)|
| 0:55:33| how long were their terms did they serve?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=3333)|
| 0:55:36| These are six-year terms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=3336)|
| 0:55:38| So they've already served six years total?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=3338)|
| 0:55:40| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=3340)|
| 0:55:41| Each, I mean, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=3341)|
| 0:55:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=3342)|
| 0:55:43| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=3343)|
| 0:55:44| And they want to go for another six?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=3344)|
| 0:55:45| They both accepted nominations for that, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=3345)|
| 0:55:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=3349)|
| 0:55:50| Mr. Fortunato is actually here this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=3350)|
| 0:55:52| Okay, and then the third seat, basically,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=3352)|
| 0:55:56| then there's actually four other names submitted for the third seat then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=3356)|
| 0:56:01| Well, the intent was we've made it a practice for many years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=3361)|
| 0:56:05| at the request of the county commission to present two,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=3365)|
| 0:56:08| if there's three seats, to present six names.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=3368)|
| 0:56:12| That's the intent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=3372)|
| 0:56:14| It's not necessarily four names for that one spot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=3374)|
| 0:56:17| It's these six for these three seats.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=3377)|
| 0:56:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=3381)|
| 0:56:23| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=3383)|
| 0:56:24| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=3384)|
| 0:56:25| Are you going to consider names submitted from commissioners for?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=3385)|
| 0:56:31| Yes, they can nominate anyone they wish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=3391)|
| 0:56:39| I guess the other question I have is in last Monday's meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=3399)|
| 0:56:46| it was my understanding that the people sitting on the current board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=3406)|
| 0:56:50| are there until they're replaced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=3410)|
| 0:56:54| I believe that is the practice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=3414)|
| 0:56:57| Is there a rush to get this done today?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=3417)|
| 0:57:00| I mean, does everybody feel comfortable about which way we need to go?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=3420)|
| 0:57:06| I feel comfortable with the nominees we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=3426)|
| 0:57:09| I'm ready.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=3429)|
| 0:57:10| Yeah, I'm ready.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=3430)|
| 0:57:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=3431)|
| 0:57:19| Commissioner Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=3439)|
| 0:57:20| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=3440)|
| 0:57:21| See, if these terms were expired in May,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=3441)|
| 0:57:24| my observation is that we're presenting information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=3444)|
| 0:57:35| with the recommendation from the development board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=3455)|
| 0:57:37| and I would have preferred to have my own recommendation come forth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=3457)|
| 0:57:42| if we knew these terms were expired in May.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=3462)|
| 0:57:45| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=3465)|
| 0:57:46| And to me, this wasn't enough time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=3466)|
| 0:57:50| I'm sure these people are vetted and the process is correct,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=3470)|
| 0:57:53| but the observation as new commissioners to provide recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=3473)|
| 0:58:00| from a cross-section of this community would have been my choice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=3480)|
| 0:58:06| Mr. Napra,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=3486)|
| 0:58:07| would you please explain the nominating committee and the process by which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=3487)|
| 0:58:10| you all go through to bring these people to us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=3490)|
| 0:58:16| Every time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=3496)|
| 0:58:17| So there is a chair typically will suggest some names| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=3497)|
| 0:58:22| or people will be asked to volunteer a subset of the industrial development board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=3502)|
| 0:58:28| So a meeting is called of that, and coming into that meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=3508)|
| 0:58:33| people that are on that committee are brought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=3513)|
| 0:58:36| A nominating committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=3516)|
| 0:58:37| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=3517)|
| 0:58:38| Bring forth names, and those names are considered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=3518)|
| 0:58:41| And it's typically based on kind of what are their backgrounds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=3521)|
| 0:58:45| what are the skill sets that we have on the board now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=3525)|
| 0:58:48| what skill sets might we be losing off of the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=3528)|
| 0:58:52| And it's not a whole lot more complicated than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=3532)|
| 0:58:56| And then we have to figure out and make sure, obviously,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=3536)|
| 0:58:58| that they're a Knox County resident.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=3538)|
| 0:59:00| And then those individuals are contacted to see whether| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=3540)|
| 0:59:04| or not they would be willing to be nominated, accept a nomination,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=3544)|
| 0:59:08| because it's a significant, you know, it's a six-year commitment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=3548)|
| 0:59:12| and we meet monthly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=3552)|
| 0:59:15| Then those nominees are then taken to the full board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=3555)|
| 0:59:19| and the board then considers the nominations brought forth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=3559)|
| 0:59:23| and then that comes as a recommendation of the full board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=3563)|
| 0:59:27| So the board did not, the full board didn't meet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=3567)|
| 0:59:32| The nominations were known before then,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=3572)|
| 0:59:34| but the full board didn't meet in order to bring those forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=3574)|
| 0:59:37| And that's why I asked all of them to come before you all last that could,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=3577)|
| 0:59:43| and it was five of them of the six that showed up last meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=3583)|
| 0:59:47| The IDP's website, does it have the terms of the length of terms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=3587)|
| 0:59:56| when things will be expiring?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=3596)|
| 0:59:58| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=3598)|
| 1:00:02| I don't think so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=3602)|
| 1:00:05| It's on the orders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=3605)|
| 1:00:08| I mean, it has them listed as whether or not their expirations are on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=3608)|
| 1:00:11| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=3611)|
| 1:00:19| Any further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=3619)|
| 1:00:22| Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=3622)|
| 1:00:23| Yeah, just one other question, Mr. Napier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=3623)|
| 1:00:25| Now, there is a non-voting commissioner that attends those meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=3625)|
| 1:00:30| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=3630)|
| 1:00:33| That is not correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=3633)|
| 1:00:34| That is not correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=3634)|
| 1:00:35| You're thinking about May Development Corporation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=3635)|
| 1:00:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=3637)|
| 1:00:38| Are there other commissioners that actually attend your meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=3638)|
| 1:00:40| as part of your meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=3640)|
| 1:00:42| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=3642)|
| 1:00:43| On the Industrial Development Board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=3643)|
| 1:00:46| and maybe you can help me, Mr. Armstrong,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=3646)|
| 1:00:49| but there's no elected officials that can be appointed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=3649)|
| 1:00:53| or either elected or employees of that can be on these boards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=3653)|
| 1:00:58| It's a little different than the Development Corporation Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=3658)|
| 1:01:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=3663)|
| 1:01:09| Commissioner Gill, are you comfortable with moving forward?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=3669)|
| 1:01:11| Yes, I am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=3671)|
| 1:01:12| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=3672)|
| 1:01:15| Okay, let's start nominations in the first district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=3675)|
| 1:01:20| Commissioner Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=3680)|
| 1:01:21| Pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=3681)|
| 1:01:23| Commissioner Gill passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=3683)|
| 1:01:26| Commissioner Carringer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=3686)|
| 1:01:27| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=3687)|
| 1:01:28| I'd like to nominate Richard S. Matlock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=3688)|
| 1:01:31| He's an attorney with Wolf McLean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=3691)|
| 1:01:34| and as I understand right now there is no attorney on this board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=3694)|
| 1:01:38| so I think Richard would be a great asset for this board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=3698)|
| 1:01:43| so he's my nomination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=3703)|
| 1:01:46| Commissioner Smear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=3706)|
| 1:01:48| I'd like to nominate Paul Fortunato.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=3708)|
| 1:01:52| I know I'm saying that wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=3712)|
| 1:01:53| Fortunato.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=3713)|
| 1:01:54| Fortunato.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=3714)|

| 1:02:06| Commissioner Nystrom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=3726)|
| 1:02:08| I'll pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=3728)|
| 1:02:09| Commissioner Nystrom passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=3729)|
| 1:02:11| Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=3731)|
| 1:02:13| Michael George.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=3733)|
| 1:02:19| Commissioner Schoonmaker nominates Michael George.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=3739)|
| 1:02:26| Brad Anders, I mean Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=3746)|
| 1:02:29| Pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=3749)|
| 1:02:32| Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=3752)|
| 1:02:37| Commissioner Bessler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=3757)|

| 1:16:55| Carnes Valley Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=4615)|
| 1:16:56| This is Resolution 903.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=4616)|
| 1:16:58| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=4618)|
| 1:16:59| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=4619)|
| 1:17:00| Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=4620)|
| 1:17:01| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=4621)|
| 1:17:03| There was some question earlier about whether this was on consent or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=4623)|
| 1:17:07| It is not about this motion or this resolution that I wish to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=4627)|
| 1:17:11| Today is Made in America Day by proclamation of the President of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=4631)|
| 1:17:17| United States, Made in America.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=4637)|
| 1:17:20| When seeing that particular article run through news cycles today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=4640)|
| 1:17:25| raised the question with me is, what's made in Tennessee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=4645)|
| 1:17:30| So you have to do a little research to find out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=4650)|
| 1:17:34| Tennessee is recognized for Gibson guitars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=4654)|
| 1:17:40| The next question, what's made in Knox County?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=4660)|
| 1:17:45| Well, I sort of paused there for a second because I wanted to really not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=4665)|
| 1:17:50| ask the question of what's best made in Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=4670)|
| 1:17:54| but looking at what's made in Knox County that causes us growth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=4674)|
| 1:17:59| Because if we don't have growth in Knox County, well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=4679)|
| 1:18:04| let me ask the question first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=4684)|
| 1:18:06| Where did the $13 million extra funding that we have this year in the Board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=4686)|
| 1:18:11| of Education budget come from except through what I perceive to be growth?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=4691)|
| 1:18:18| In a world of ever-increasing cost, if we don't have growth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=4698)|
| 1:18:23| we have to cut service or raise cash flow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=4703)|
| 1:18:30| You notice I said raise cash flow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=4710)|
| 1:18:33| A little bit of understanding of what we do here at County Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=4713)|
| 1:18:36| the governmental function, several members of Commission have at various| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=4716)|
| 1:18:41| times been involved in stimulating growth in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=4721)|
| 1:18:45| Some three commissioners right now sit on the development corporation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=4725)|
| 1:18:49| for example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=4729)|
| 1:18:50| And growth in Knox County happens two ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=4730)|
| 1:18:53| It happens the good old-fashioned way, and I'll recognize Pete Claussen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=4733)|
| 1:19:01| several different entities, but one in particular,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=4741)|
| 1:19:04| Knoxville Locomotive Works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=4744)|
| 1:19:07| He's been here a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=4747)|
| 1:19:09| He's done a lot of things with railroads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=4749)|
| 1:19:12| He takes those old, worn-out things and makes brand-new, green,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=4752)|
| 1:19:16| high-performance, clean locomotive work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=4756)|
| 1:19:22| But he's been encouraged to grow in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=4762)|
| 1:19:27| The second example in the 8th District, East Bridge, Lifetime Products,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=4767)|
| 1:19:38| was a one-year occurrence from groundbreaking to ribbon-cutting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=4778)|
| 1:19:46| 700,000 square feet under one roof for an organization| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=4786)|
| 1:19:55| that wasn't in East Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=4795)|
| 1:19:57| They weren't in Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=4797)|
| 1:19:58| They weren't in the eastern United States.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=4798)|
| 1:20:05| It's supposed to bring 500 jobs to Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=4805)|
| 1:20:11| And I think we commissioned the development corporation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=4811)|
| 1:20:17| had an impact on that growth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=4817)|
| 1:20:19| Even item number 37 that was on our agenda today was about growth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=4819)|
| 1:20:27| moving property into an account where we can encourage people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=4827)|
| 1:20:32| to build new business in Commissioner Anders' district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=4832)|
| 1:20:38| So I just wanted to pause us for a second| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=4838)|
| 1:20:44| and make sure that we have an eye out for how do we help Knox County grow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=4844)|
| 1:20:52| And when business is looking for a home, Knox County needs to be ready.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=4852)|
| 1:21:00| It's not really related to this, but it's related to growth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=4860)|
| 1:21:03| and the development corporation is related to growth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=4863)|
| 1:21:06| and we encourage growth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=4866)|
| 1:21:08| And I just want us to remember that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=4868)|
| 1:21:09| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=4869)|
| 1:21:11| And I move to approve this resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=4871)|
| 1:21:15| Thank you, Chairman Wright, for pointing that out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=4875)|
| 1:21:17| And since Todd's here, I'll say a few things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=4877)|
| 1:21:19| I've had the honor and the privilege of serving on the development corp| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=4879)|
| 1:21:21| for the last three years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=4881)|
| 1:21:24| And during that time, a lot of people don't understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=4884)|
| 1:21:26| exactly what the development corp does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=4886)|
| 1:21:28| But we bring in jobs that have to meet a certain number| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=4888)|
| 1:21:33| and pay a certain wage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=4893)|
| 1:21:35| or they don't qualify for any of the tax incentives| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=4895)|
| 1:21:38| that they might otherwise wish they could get.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=4898)|
| 1:21:42| But the development corp does a great job of bringing in high-quality jobs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=4902)|
| 1:21:48| jobs that actually have spin-off jobs from them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=4908)|
| 1:21:53| So thank you, Todd, for everything you guys do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=4913)|
| 1:21:57| Any further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=4917)|
| 1:21:59| We have a motion and a second before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=4919)|

| 1:25:02| Item 79 is discussion item to set the time for the upcoming reorganization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=5102)|
| 1:25:07| We have come up with a time of 5 o'clock on September 4th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=5107)|
| 1:25:11| We cannot vote on that until the August meeting due to a statute, actually it's a rule that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=5111)|
| 1:25:16| we put in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=5116)|
| 1:25:17| Do you care to explain that, Mr. Law Director?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=5117)|
| 1:25:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=5121)|
| 1:25:22| Well, the main reason I think that you have the rule and the main reason to drive the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=5122)|
| 1:25:27| statute is to get your notice closer to reality when you're actually going to do something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=5127)|
| 1:25:32| If you have a notice too far out or you convene and vote on something too far out, oftentimes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=5132)|
| 1:25:38| the public doesn't have an opportunity to make arrangements to attend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=5138)|
| 1:25:43| Under your rule, you have a 30-day, I think it's a 30-day notice limit and conveyance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=5143)|
| 1:25:50| limit, which means the proper time for you to vote on this will probably be your next| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=5150)|
| 1:25:55| commission meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=5155)|
| 1:25:57| You can set your, you can discuss and say where your chairman can put it on the agenda| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=5157)|
| 1:26:02| next time where you can actually vote on something because this is a discussion item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=5162)|
| 1:26:08| I think you mentioned some date at your last meeting and he was going to mention something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=5168)|
| 1:26:13| tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=5173)|
| 1:26:14| Is this still good?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=5174)|
| 1:26:15| Do we have a conflict?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=5175)|
| 1:26:16| Because then you can prepare something to vote on next time and then Drew will be able| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=5176)|
| 1:26:20| to give your notice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=5180)|
| 1:26:21| Then you can reorganize is basically it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=5181)|
| 1:26:23| So this is just in compliance with state law and compliance with your own rule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=5183)|
| 1:26:28| We're a little ahead of the game, but this is the time for you all to kind of come to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=5188)|
| 1:26:33| some form of a consensus so your chairman can have a reasonable date to get a room and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=5193)|
| 1:26:37| do those type of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=5197)|
| 1:26:39| Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=5199)|
| 1:26:40| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=5200)|
| 1:26:41| So what you're saying is we need to take action during the commission meeting on August the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=5201)|
| 1:26:45| 27th, which is a Monday, and we're planning to meet the following Tuesday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=5205)|
| 1:26:50| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=5210)|
| 1:26:51| That gives us time to get the five-day notice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=5211)|
| 1:26:53| Even though, that's true, because a Saturday still counts as a five-day notice, so it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=5213)|
| 1:26:58| not Thursday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=5218)|
| 1:26:59| Saturday's a day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=5219)|
| 1:27:00| It's usually a good day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=5220)|
| 1:27:04| Is everybody still good with the time of 5 o'clock on September 4th?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=5224)|
| 1:27:10| And, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=5230)|
| 1:27:14| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=5234)|
| 1:27:15| Item number 80.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=5235)|
| 1:27:17| to address concerns of code issues with subcontractors that work for larger corporations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=5237)|
| 1:27:24| Mr. Bossert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=5244)|
| 1:27:25| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=5245)|
| 1:27:27| There were some items come up about codes, and codes, we have these rules set that certain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=5247)|
| 1:27:32| things are to be done certain ways, and one of the things that I've run into here lately,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=5252)|
| 1:27:38| and I've had complaints about four or five different ways, people are starting to remodel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=5258)|
| 1:27:43| their houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=5263)|
| 1:27:44| They're starting to redo the decks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=5264)|
| 1:27:47| They start redoing rooms and things like this where they go and they buy the materials from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=5267)|
| 1:27:51| one corporation and they come out and they set up and they're going to build this structure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=5271)|
| 1:27:59| Some of them come from some large corporations and one of the ones was in our neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=5279)|
| 1:28:04| and they sent out a contractor and they started digging up and doing foundations and they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=5284)|
| 1:28:12| were doing a deck and things of that sort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=5292)|
| 1:28:15| I was looking at it and I said, I'm not a builder, but I looked at it and I said, that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=5295)|
| 1:28:18| wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=5298)|
| 1:28:19| I mean, this just doesn't add up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=5299)|
| 1:28:23| And I mentioned it to my neighbor and he looked at it and he said, well, what do I need to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=5303)|
| 1:28:27| do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=5307)|
| 1:28:28| I said, call codes officials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=5308)|
| 1:28:30| They came out there and the first thing they asked, do you have a building permit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=5310)|
| 1:28:35| This large, that they got from this large corporation, they didn't have a building permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=5315)|
| 1:28:41| And they should have had because they were putting that individual using them without| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=5321)|
| 1:28:47| proper supervision or proper codes or proper building actions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=5327)|
| 1:28:54| Something could have happened on that deck and that person would have been liable for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=5334)|
| 1:28:57| what people did on that deck if the deck collapsed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=5337)|
| 1:29:02| There's other things that goes on out there that they do work for people inside their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=5342)|
| 1:29:07| houses where they're laying hardwood floors or they're laying ceramic tiles and things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=5347)|
| 1:29:14| of that sort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=5354)|
| 1:29:17| Then you have a problem that they're doing that wrong and I think there's a law that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=5357)|
| 1:29:24| says that you complain to them that they're doing it wrong, you don't like the work they're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=5364)|
| 1:29:29| doing and they're doing it really, really bad and you fire them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=5369)|
| 1:29:34| But there's something out there that says that you've got to give them a chance to correct| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=5374)|
| 1:29:40| their mistakes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=5380)|
| 1:29:42| I think that's still in effect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=5382)|
| 1:29:45| And there you go, you're having a person you've had a disagreement with that's tried to fix| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=5385)|
| 1:29:50| the issue and when they get through, it's still wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=5390)|
| 1:29:54| I don't know how we address these codes issues, which brings into some other situations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=5394)|
| 1:30:02| Let's say, for instance, we do a zoning and we go to PR or PC for commercial and everything's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=5402)|
| 1:30:13| supposed to be planned out, laid out and done this way that everything fits on the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=5413)|
| 1:30:19| like it's supposed to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=5419)|
| 1:30:22| Who really checks to make sure that the roads are in the right positions and the right angles| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=5422)|
| 1:30:27| that are coming off the main roads and if they have enough turning radius when they're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=5427)|
| 1:30:32| going in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=5432)|
| 1:30:34| And if that's the case, if it's set up under PR where it's totally planned under final| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=5434)|
| 1:30:41| plan and it's approved, in some of these subdivisions we get people coming in and requesting a variance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=5441)|
| 1:30:52| One lot doesn't fit right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=5452)|
| 1:30:54| Well, if it was totally planned in this way and it was approved and the house, that one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=5454)|
| 1:31:01| lot needed a variance to get a house on it, it was planned that way that was given to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=5461)|
| 1:31:07| the NPC, yet who followed up to make sure that that lot was laid out right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=5467)|
| 1:31:14| I mean, I know why we have variances because things change and people need a variance to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=5474)|
| 1:31:21| get something done on their lot because there's new things come about and new things we use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=5481)|
| 1:31:30| and we have to address those issues by making new actions that will allow them to use their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=5490)|
| 1:31:37| property the way they want to use it, if it can be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=5497)|
| 1:31:41| But my question is here, who's in charge of taking care of the codes and ordinances that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=5501)|
| 1:31:48| we do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=5508)|
| 1:31:49| Who do you call and when you call them, it's normally after the fact, who makes sure it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=5509)|
| 1:31:54| done right when it's starting to be done instead of going back and fixing it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=5514)|
| 1:32:00| I don't know how we address that issue, I mean, I don't like to see somebody out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=5520)|
| 1:32:05| every day telling them, well, you're putting in the road three feet over this way too far,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=5525)|
| 1:32:11| therefore it makes everything out of line, but the plot plan says it's done this way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=5531)|
| 1:32:15| so it works and it's done and these codes are set up to protect people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=5535)|
| 1:32:21| Now, who's in charge of that, how do we get it straightened and how do we make sure that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=5541)|
| 1:32:26| we're protecting the citizens from larger corporations that are hiring subcontractors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=5546)|
| 1:32:32| and some of them don't even have building license or even license to build.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=5552)|
| 1:32:39| So, where do we go from there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=5559)|
| 1:32:42| How do we protect our people from some people taking advantage of the lack of knowledge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=5562)|
| 1:32:48| of an individual redoing their house?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=5568)|
| 1:32:51| And that's all I was bringing that up, it just seemed like it was just frustrating that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=5571)|
| 1:32:56| two weeks ago I got seven different calls about things happening that shouldn't have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=5576)|
| 1:33:00| been happening from businesses that are reputable or have these large names and you have to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=5580)|
| 1:33:07| call the CEO to get it taken care of for these people and it shouldn't have happened| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=5587)|
| 1:33:13| in the first place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=5593)|
| 1:33:14| So, that's all I brought that up, I just wanted to mention that to you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=5594)|
| 1:33:22| Commissioner Carringer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=5602)|
| 1:33:24| I just wanted to make sure I understood what Charlie was talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=5604)|
| 1:33:28| You're talking about basically inside of your home when you're having remodeling done or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=5608)|
| 1:33:33| Outside too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=5613)|
| 1:33:34| And outside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=5614)|
| 1:33:35| Well, in terms of, I mean, isn't it really left up to the property owner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=5615)|
| 1:33:44| I mean, when you hire a company, isn't it, as I've always understood, I mean, it doesn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=5624)|
| 1:33:54| have anything to do with Knox County or what we have done inside our homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=5634)|
| 1:34:00| I mean, unless we're starting from scratch and building and you've got, you know, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=5640)|
| 1:34:05| codes has come out and make sure that the electrical and the plumbing and different| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=5645)|
| 1:34:10| things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=5650)|
| 1:34:11| But I think when it comes to remodeling your home inside, that's the property owner's responsibility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=5651)|
| 1:34:20| is it not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=5660)|
| 1:34:21| I mean, roads and all, that would come under our highway when they're putting in subdivisions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=5661)|
| 1:34:25| or whatever on that, but I think when you're doing it for a personal friend, and I know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=5665)|
| 1:34:33| all of us sitting up here have had friends who have built and had trouble, trouble with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=5673)|
| 1:34:38| their builders and all and things not done right and all, and if you choose to do something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=5678)|
| 1:34:44| to help them, that's taken on as a personal friend, being a friend, but I don't think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=5684)|
| 1:34:49| Knox County codes follows under anything in terms of us remodeling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=5689)|
| 1:34:54| I mean, I just wanted to clarify, make sure I understand what you're talking about, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=5694)|
| 1:34:59| I think that Knox County doesn't really get brought in when it's on personal property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=5699)|
| 1:35:05| unless it's some...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=5705)|
| 1:35:07| Let's let Dwight speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=5707)|
| 1:35:09| Thank you, Mr. Chairman, Commissioner Bessler, Mr. Carringer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=5709)|
| 1:35:15| As succinctly as I can, new construction, obviously, this commission has adopted the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=5715)|
| 1:35:20| 2012 International Code of Counselors, residential building code, commercial code, international| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=5720)|
| 1:35:25| property maintenance code, and so forth, so for new construction, we will always inspect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=5725)|
| 1:35:28| and regulate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=5728)|
| 1:35:31| Remodeling gets into a complicated space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=5731)|
| 1:35:32| If you do a room addition, that should be permitted under the code, you should have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=5732)|
| 1:35:37| to bring in a set of plans, and we would inspect during construction, as Commissioner Carringer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=5737)|
| 1:35:43| alluded to, we'd inspect the framing and things like that, electrical would be inspected| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=5743)|
| 1:35:47| by the state, signed off, we won't give you a CO until we see the sticker from the state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=5747)|
| 1:35:51| and indicates that they've approved it, and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=5751)|
| 1:35:54| I will tell this commission, it's a very difficult area to police.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=5754)|
| 1:35:57| People will take a deck and convert it to a sunroom, they'll hire a contractor, those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=5757)|
| 1:36:02| contractors will say, I'll take care of permitting, which consists of not getting any permits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=5762)|
| 1:36:08| and there is absolutely no way across 528 square miles that we will see people putting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=5768)|
| 1:36:13| on decks, room additions, and that sort of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=5773)|
| 1:36:16| So we work very hard, really, to just educate people to say, if you're going to have this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=5776)|
| 1:36:21| kind of work done, come and get a permit, it's not so that we can generate that modest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=5781)|
| 1:36:26| permit fee, it's so that we can make sure we can hold your contractor accountable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=5786)|
| 1:36:32| Once you get inside the home, it's even trickier, people will frequently have somebody come| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=5792)|
| 1:36:36| in to remodel a bathroom and tile a floor, and it's an absolute disaster.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=5796)|
| 1:36:40| We'll have no knowledge of that, and typically we won't be involved in that process at all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=5800)|
| 1:36:44| that is simply a civil matter between the homeowner and the party that they've contracted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=5804)|
| 1:36:50| with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=5810)|
| 1:36:51| The same thing is true with driveway resurfacing, we don't police that, and it doesn't require| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=5811)|
| 1:36:55| a permit, and boy howdy, if there's a place where there's a lot of fraud, it's driveway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=5815)|
| 1:36:59| resurfacing every spring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=5819)|
| 1:37:01| So I would want to mention that I think Randy Lilly, who's now your chief building official,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=5821)|
| 1:37:06| is trying to look at innovative ways to make people aware, including he's looking at the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=5826)|
| 1:37:11| possibility of kiosks in your major home centers, like Lowe's and Home Depot, that would alert| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=5831)|
| 1:37:17| people to the fact that they need a permit, and why they need a permit, and again, it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=5837)|
| 1:37:21| not so that we can collect that $50 fee, it's so we can make sure that that deck is properly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=5841)|
| 1:37:26| constructed, and he's working hard at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=5846)|
| 1:37:31| He's new in the position, but he's doing good things, and I think that over time, this is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=5851)|
| 1:37:34| an area where we'll continue to get better, but let the buyer beware, always.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=5854)|
| 1:37:40| Commissioner Busser.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=5860)|
| 1:37:41| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=5861)|
| 1:37:43| I started this off by prefacing saying, in my statement here, is subcontractors that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=5863)|
| 1:37:50| large corporations use, and you go and you buy a building material, and they say, oh,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=5870)|
| 1:37:55| I can get you a subcontractor, and we'll charge you this to build that, and again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=5875)|
| 1:38:05| that's a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=5885)|
| 1:38:06| This is a large corporation that does business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=5886)|
| 1:38:08| We license them, we see all their trucks and things that they use, but some of them don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=5888)|
| 1:38:13| use licensed contractors, which they should, and that puts the emphasis on the individual| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=5893)|
| 1:38:19| could be liable in thinking that this large corporation was taking care of what they were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=5899)|
| 1:38:24| going to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=5904)|
| 1:38:25| They want to stand behind that subcontractor, and anyway, that's all I wanted to bring up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=5905)|
| 1:38:32| I don't know how we would do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=5912)|
| 1:38:34| It's a massive thing to do, and you've got friends doing friends, and even those large| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=5914)|
| 1:38:41| corporations will do electrical work inside the house when they replace your appliances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=5921)|
| 1:38:47| or they replace some of your lighting and things like this, and that may not be a licensed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=5927)|
| 1:38:52| electrician that they're using to get money off of you, and there again is an issue, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=5932)|
| 1:38:58| I'm not one to police anything that's done, but there are people so gullible and not knowing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=5938)|
| 1:39:05| how to see how framing should be done, like on decking, or how electrical wiring should| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=5945)|
| 1:39:11| be wired, and I just brought that up as I say, you know, how do we do these to the large| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=5951)|
| 1:39:20| I mean, these are large corporations we're dealing with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=5960)|
| 1:39:22| I'm not talking about these little people who get your neighbor to do it, but anyway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=5962)|
| 1:39:26| I'm through with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=5966)|
| 1:39:27| I'm just mentioning that this is an issue that is going to come up and bite us one of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=5967)|
| 1:39:32| these days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=5972)|
| 1:39:33| Mr. Chairman, if I could get one more on the record, vinyl siding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=5973)|
| 1:39:36| It's where a lot of homeowners have been taken advantage of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=5976)|
| 1:39:40| My lord, it's vinyl siding, so let the buyer beware.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=5980)|
| 1:39:44| Mr. Thomas?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=5984)|
| 1:39:45| Just something that comes to mind that I think a lot of people, when they think about permits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=5985)|
| 1:39:50| they think I'm going to save a little money here, save a little there, and I'm going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=5990)|
| 1:39:52| do a little more, but I learned a lesson a long time ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=5992)|
| 1:39:58| For example, I had a neighbor that built on, took their garage and made it into a beautiful,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=5998)|
| 1:40:05| beautiful extra room, bonus room, and so forth, but when the house burnt down, the only thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=6005)|
| 1:40:12| the insurance company would do would build a garage back because it wasn't permitted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=6012)|
| 1:40:17| So people need to be aware that a lot of these things are there to help make sure that that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=6017)|
| 1:40:24| homeowner is protected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=6024)|
| 1:40:26| Commissioner Carringer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=6026)|
| 1:40:31| Just to, I think, clarify, too, what Charlie and you're saying, major corporations, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=6031)|
| 1:40:36| this is just an example, Best Buy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=6036)|
| 1:40:39| Best Buy sells appliances and all, and they have subcontractors that they hire that will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=6039)|
| 1:40:46| put their appliances in, and so I think when things go wrong with that, how do we, I guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=6046)|
| 1:40:55| how do we keep large corporations, them hiring the licensed contractors, and I guess we don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=6055)|
| 1:41:05| have any say-so with how businesses subcontract out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=6065)|
| 1:41:09| I mean, that's just a question I hadn't thought about, but I mean, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=6069)|
| 1:41:14| Okay, I just want to mention, I didn't mention any big names.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=6074)|
| 1:41:17| I didn't mention any people out there, so I don't want to be reliable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=6077)|
| 1:41:20| No, that's why I was just using that as an example that, you know, Best Buy has all these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=6080)|
| 1:41:25| appliances now, and they also, it's like if you buy computers or anything, you know, they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=6085)|
| 1:41:30| have somebody that comes in that they subcontract out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=6090)|
| 1:41:34| And that's what you're saying is these major corporations, the people they hire to subcontract| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=6094)|

| 1:42:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=6126)|
| 1:42:07| One of the things I want to read to you about soft targets is the definition of terrorist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=6127)|

| 1:55:07| Hi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=6907)|
| 1:55:08| Hugh Nystrom, 613 Scottswood Circle, Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=6908)|
| 1:55:11| Who are you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=6911)|
| 1:55:12| Hugh N-Y-S-T-R-O-M.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=6912)|
| 1:55:17| Good evening to my fellow commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=6917)|
| 1:55:19| It's very rare to see a county commissioner sponsoring a rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=6919)|
| 1:55:24| We look at how much time and effort we put into getting these things right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=6924)|
| 1:55:28| But it's also equally rare that you find a home in your district that you can trace it back to the 1700s, 1795 specifically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=6928)|
| 1:55:41| It seems like it was almost a year ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=6941)|
| 1:55:43| The Wallace family reached out to me to help them in their goal of getting a historic overlay specifically set up for this property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=6943)|
| 1:55:52| to help protect the part of this house structure that can trace its lineage all the way back to the 1700s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=6952)|
| 1:56:00| It's not an overlay for a whole neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=6960)|
| 1:56:03| It's not an overlay even for the whole community out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=6963)|
| 1:56:07| We're literally just trying to protect this part of this particular historic structure from being demolished.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=6967)|
| 1:56:15| I also want to be clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=6975)|
| 1:56:17| I have absolutely no equity, no interest, no ownership in the house or anything like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=6977)|
| 1:56:22| So I benefit absolutely none by granting this historic overlay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=6982)|
| 1:56:28| So we do have the family here to speak about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=6988)|
| 1:56:31| But also before we introduce the family and tell you a little bit about what the Wallace has put into this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=6991)|
| 1:56:36| I'd like to introduce my friend Kate Graybiel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=6996)|
| 1:56:38| Would you raise your hand over there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=6998)|
| 1:56:40| She is the historic preservation planner from MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=7000)|
| 1:56:44| And from where she's sitting, she's going to give you all about a two-, three-, four-minute or so overview on this property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=7004)|
| 1:56:51| and basically give us a little history lesson while she's at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=7011)|
| 1:56:55| So go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=7015)|
| 1:56:58| Good evening, Chairman Smith and commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=7018)|
| 1:57:00| I just would like to go over just a brief what we call a statement of significance for the cabin,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=7020)|
| 1:57:05| the basis for which we feel this cabin is special and should be designated and protected with our HZ overlay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=7025)|
| 1:57:17| This cabin is located at 1623 Cove Creek Lane in the Glen Cove subdivision near the Bearden community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=7037)|
| 1:57:26| It has existed there and provided shelter for its habitants since about 1796.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=7046)|
| 1:57:32| So today it is still situated on the last vestiges of the original 300-acre land grant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=7052)|
| 1:57:38| The designation is for a 1.26-acre portion of the entire 3.76-acre lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=7058)|
| 1:57:49| Just a brief statement of significance is that it is a rare intact example of a 17th century log house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=7069)|
| 1:57:56| It dates to about 1796 and represents early settlement patterns and log construction techniques in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=7076)|
| 1:58:04| So you may not be able to see this clearly on the screen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=7084)|
| 1:58:07| The entire 3.67-acre parcel is outlined in red.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=7087)|
| 1:58:11| You also have that in your packets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=7091)|
| 1:58:13| And this is just to give you an overview of the context of the cabin site| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=7093)|
| 1:58:19| and then also to show you that tonight we are proposing to designate only 1.26 acres of that entire lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=7099)|
| 1:58:26| because it includes the cabin and the land around it to protect some of the context.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=7106)|
| 1:58:34| It mostly follows the lot lines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=7114)|
| 1:58:38| However, the cabin, which is to the lower left-hand corner of the screen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=7118)|
| 1:58:46| a building was attached behind it, a house about 1919, sort of a craftsman-style house,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=7126)|
| 1:58:51| which has experienced a lot of changes and so it is not of particular significance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=7131)|
| 1:58:57| So what we are attempting to do is just designate the log cabin portion of the house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=7137)|
| 1:59:03| And so the red line there on the structure shows where there is a division between the cabin and the rest of the house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=7143)|
| 1:59:09| So the cabin would be subject to demolition protection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=7149)|
| 1:59:13| Any review of any major changes to the exterior, whereas the house to the back could still be changed or demolished| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=7153)|
| 1:59:20| since it does not hold any particular significance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=7160)|
| 1:59:25| If you can see this in your package a little better, the red square represents the floor plan of the cabin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=7165)|
| 1:59:32| And you can see where the house was built on behind it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=7172)|
| 1:59:36| And in front of it is just a simple frame for a future screened-in porch,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=7176)|
| 1:59:39| which can be easily removed and will not damage any historic material.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=7179)|
| 1:59:46| So information about the history of this cabin and its inhabitants was derived from a number of sources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=7186)|
| 1:59:52| Of primary significance is the analysis and collection of copies of each available land deed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=7192)|
| 1:59:57| and tax record pertaining to the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=7197)|
| 2:00:00| And these were all collected by the late Dr. Samuel E. Wallace in the 1990s,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=7200)|
| 2:00:04| to whom we are very grateful for his research.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=7204)|
| 2:00:08| He is a published author and was a professor of sociology at UT for over 30 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=7208)|
| 2:00:13| He was also a steward and an admirer of this cabin for nearly four decades.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=7213)|
| 2:00:18| These official records are supplemented by recollections and personal knowledge from previous owners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=7218)|
| 2:00:23| as well as from the research and knowledge of Dr. Wallace's partner, Everett Lide,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=7223)|
| 2:00:29| and daughter, Amelia Wallace, who are with us tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=7229)|
| 2:00:33| And they are the applicants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=7233)|
| 2:00:35| Finally, extensive inspection of existing physical features and evidentiary markings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=7235)|
| 2:00:40| also contribute to the historical and architectural analysis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=7240)|
| 2:00:46| This view shows just the wood framing for a screened-in porch,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=7246)|
| 2:00:50| but we're looking at the front of the cabin, and this view also shows the original stone chimney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=7250)|
| 2:00:56| The early history can best be characterized as a homestead,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=7256)|
| 2:00:59| with its initial high-quality construction performed by Stockley Donaldson,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=7259)|
| 2:01:04| his brother-in-law to President Andrew Jackson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=7264)|
| 2:01:07| So this cabin is significant mainly for its architecture and construction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=7267)|
| 2:01:11| but we do have this little piece of history here that tells us there was a significant person| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=7271)|
| 2:01:16| that was at least somewhat associated with this cabin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=7276)|
| 2:01:20| Its next 30 years, it was owned by John Sterling and son until about 1823,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=7280)|
| 2:01:26| and then another 64 years of belonging to the Barger family until 1919,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=7286)|
| 2:01:32| which is about when the Craftsman House was built onto the back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=7292)|
| 2:01:37| So we have some details.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=7297)|
| 2:01:39| This shows a door which is very early, possibly original, on the front.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=7299)|
| 2:01:46| At any rate, the opening is still in the same location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=7306)|
| 2:01:49| This shows the V-notched log construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=7309)|
| 2:01:52| The logs for the cabin were likely locally felled of old-growth pine,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=7312)|
| 2:01:56| and they're fashioned together with these hand-carved V-notched joints,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=7316)|
| 2:02:01| which are still visible in several places throughout the house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=7321)|
| 2:02:04| Between the logs and all but the outermost cabin wall,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=7324)|
| 2:02:07| there exists Tennessee clay with horsehair and cord cob mud-dobbing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=7327)|
| 2:02:11| reinforced with a layer of secco over the top.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=7331)|
| 2:02:15| This shows some interior shots, so you can see the walls of the cabin are still exposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=7335)|
| 2:02:21| The logs are still exposed on the interior.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=7341)|
| 2:02:23| You can get a good view of their size and how this was put together also by looking at the interior.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=7343)|
| 2:02:30| This was a later staircase added, but there was a second floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=7350)|
| 2:02:34| Now there's still part of that second floor remaining as a loft.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=7354)|
| 2:02:40| The cabin also retains a couple of pre-colonial wooden double-hung windows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=7360)|
| 2:02:47| So this overall house structure includes another log cabin to the rear or the west side,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=7367)|
| 2:02:52| which served as a summer or seasonal kitchen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=7372)|
| 2:02:54| Beginning about 1855, it was a separate cabin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=7374)|
| 2:02:58| But beginning in 1919, when the house was built, it connected the two cabins together,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=7378)|
| 2:03:03| and the kitchen was extensively remodeled,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=7383)|
| 2:03:07| so it doesn't quite retain the same historic integrity as the front part does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=7387)|
| 2:03:12| So those rear portions are not included in the historic overlay nomination| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=7392)|
| 2:03:16| since they don't retain their character.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=7396)|
| 2:03:18| Tonight we are looking at the designation for just the original main log cabin portion of the house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=7398)|
| 2:03:30| Thank you, Kay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=7410)|
| 2:03:31| I'd also like to introduce the family members who did all the –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=7411)|
| 2:03:35| honestly, they could put a title company out of work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=7415)|
| 2:03:37| They put so much effort into tracing this title back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=7417)|
| 2:03:39| Would you all like to come up briefly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=7419)|
| 2:03:41| Mia, you're –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=7421)|
| 2:03:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=7427)|
| 2:03:48| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=7428)|
| 2:03:49| Thank you for y'all's consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=7429)|
| 2:03:51| If you have any questions about this, Kay or the family,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=7431)|
| 2:03:55| or I would be glad to try and answer them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=7435)|
| 2:03:57| Otherwise, I'd like to entertain a motion for approval from one of my counterparts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=7437)|
| 2:04:01| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=7441)|

| 2:04:04| He's running a meeting from down there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=7444)|
| 2:04:08| I should note that there is a set of design guidelines that go with the designation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=7448)|
| 2:04:13| the Secretary of Interior Standards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=7453)|
| 2:04:15| and these are standard guidelines that help guide the owners on any changes or renovations to the cabin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=7455)|
| 2:04:23| Hugh, did you want to make that motion to approve per MPC?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=7463)|
| 2:04:26| I'll – since it is my district, I'll go ahead and –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=7466)|
| 2:04:29| I'd like to make a motion to approve this historic overlay per MPC recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=7469)|

| 2:05:36| The PR zoning at the recommended density would allow reasonable development of the site consistent with the sector plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=7536)|

| 2:08:48| 5-D-18-RZ is appealed by Ashley Haley, an option holder of MPC decision to deny rezoning to PR plan residential property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=7728)|
| 2:08:59| located northwest side of East Turpin Lane, northeast of Couch Mill Road in the 6th Commission District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=7739)|
| 2:09:07| Is the applicant present?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=7747)|
| 2:09:12| Is there any opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=7752)|
| 2:09:18| May we get the report from the MPC staff?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=7758)|
| 2:09:21| Thank you, Mr. Chair, members of the Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=7761)|
| 2:09:23| The Metropolitan Planning Commission voted 8-5 to recommend that to, excuse me, to deny the rezoning to PR| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=7763)|
| 2:09:30| consistent with the denial recommendation for the associated sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=7770)|
| 2:09:36| The Commission found that the area located in the midst of an agriculturally zoned area with larger lots,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=7776)|
| 2:09:43| that the proposed zoning would not provide for development that was consistent with the surrounding area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=7783)|
| 2:09:48| There were also concerns about the access both along Couch Mill Road, a road with a 16-foot pavement width,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=7788)|
| 2:09:54| and Couch Mill Road, a shorter section of road with pavement widths from 16 feet to 10 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=7794)|
| 2:10:01| The Commission felt that the development proposed under the request of rezoning would be out of character| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=7801)|
| 2:10:07| with the surrounding area and would constitute spot zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=7807)|
| 2:10:13| Does the applicant wish to speak first?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=7813)|
| 2:10:17| Would you like to defer to the opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=7817)|
| 2:10:21| If you would, please give your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=7821)|
| 2:10:25| My name is Kim Frazier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=7825)|
| 2:10:26| I reside at 11835 Couch Mill Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=7826)|
| 2:10:29| I'm here today not only as a resident that this development would directly impact,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=7829)|
| 2:10:35| but also as the founder of Hardin Valley Planning Advocates,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=7835)|
| 2:10:38| a community group of Knox County residents who advocate for those living and working in the Hardin Valley area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=7838)|
| 2:10:44| We focus on things like ways to manage growth, coordinating infrastructure improvements with developments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=7844)|
| 2:10:50| land use and its effect, communication between the community and developers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=7850)|
| 2:10:55| and ways to conserve resources by working with Knox County departments, MPC, and elected officials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=7855)|
| 2:11:01| So on behalf of Hardin Valley, thank you for this opportunity to speak and also your service to Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=7861)|
| 2:11:07| I want to acknowledge the staff at MPC and the County Director of Engineering and Public Works| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=7867)|
| 2:11:11| who have and continue to be an incredible resource and supporter of our efforts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=7871)|
| 2:11:17| to bring attention to the growing challenges that our community faces with explosive continued development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=7877)|
| 2:11:23| The northwest sector continues to be the fastest growing in all of Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=7883)|
| 2:11:27| capturing one-fourth of the county's building activity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=7887)|
| 2:11:30| producing a growth rate that is 3.9% over the average 1.2%| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=7890)|
| 2:11:35| with a new dwelling being constructed every 32 hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=7895)|
| 2:11:39| So Hardin Valley is booming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=7899)|
| 2:11:41| So if you're here today to support commission, well, they've already stood up for you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=7901)|
| 2:11:45| but I want to acknowledge everyone that is here to support commission upholding MPC's decision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=7905)|
| 2:11:52| to deny rezoning for this development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=7912)|
| 2:11:55| Commissioners, this community has made every effort to follow the suggested steps| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=7915)|
| 2:11:59| to work together with developers for positive and suitable community growth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=7919)|
| 2:12:03| They have met with the Healy's and Mr. Davis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=7923)|
| 2:12:06| who we'd like to thank for their cooperation and willingness to do so,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=7926)|
| 2:12:10| and they've been specific with their concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=7930)|
| 2:12:13| They have learned the process and they understand it, and they have stayed informed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=7933)|
| 2:12:18| Leading up to the June 14th MPC meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=7938)|
| 2:12:21| residents effectively communicated their concerns to MPC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=7941)|
| 2:12:24| and all other appropriate parties as to why this development was not suitable on this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=7944)|
| 2:12:30| Those included the development would disrupt the established rural community of homes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=7950)|
| 2:12:35| residing on larger acreages and farms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=7955)|
| 2:12:38| The development would be out of place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=7958)|
| 2:12:41| There are sewage, water, drainage, and utilities concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=7961)|
| 2:12:45| There's encroachment on adjacent properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=7965)|
| 2:12:47| There's continued stress on already overcrowded schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=7967)|
| 2:12:52| Site distances accessing the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=7972)|
| 2:12:55| Land ownership questions that are still unanswered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=7975)|
| 2:12:59| Incomplete land deed information that has not been addressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=7979)|
| 2:13:03| Crossing a private drive to access a public road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=7983)|
| 2:13:06| And most importantly, critically unsafe roads that would cost the county millions of dollars to improve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=7986)|
| 2:13:12| MPC staff concurred with the residents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=7992)|
| 2:13:15| and recommended to deny the requested LDR sector plan designation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=7995)|
| 2:13:19| and the requested rezoning stating there's no justification to warrant an amendment to this sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=7999)|
| 2:13:25| The property is located in rural and it has poor access.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=8005)|
| 2:13:29| The existing rural sector plan is appropriate for this site and should be maintained.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=8009)|
| 2:13:34| The agricultural zone allows residents development on one acre minimum size.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=8014)|
| 2:13:40| Approval of this zoning would constitute a spot rezoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=8020)|
| 2:13:44| giving this property development rights that no one in the immediate area would be afforded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=8024)|
| 2:13:49| Upholding MPC's decision would send a positive message to all communities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=8029)|
| 2:13:55| that all growth and development is good for our county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=8035)|
| 2:13:58| It should be appropriate and cohesive with established areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=8038)|
| 2:14:02| This one just simply is not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=8042)|
| 2:14:07| Continuing to make exceptions and amendments to our beautifully designed sector plans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=8047)|
| 2:14:11| and not upholding decisions made by the professionals at MPC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=8051)|
| 2:14:15| is failing the comprehensive land use planning process established by our state, county and citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=8055)|
| 2:14:21| I ask you please to support MPC's recommendation and to deny this appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=8061)|
| 2:14:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=8071)|
| 2:14:33| Would the applicant wish to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=8073)|
| 2:14:42| Is it okay if I hand something out to the commissioners?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=8082)|
| 2:14:44| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=8084)|
| 2:15:03| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=8103)|
| 2:15:27| Scott Davis, PO Box 11315, Knoxville 37939.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=8127)|
| 2:15:32| And I appreciate you all's time in hearing this tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=8132)|
| 2:15:35| And I also want to thank Kim Frazier and all the folks in the Hardin Valley area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=8135)|
| 2:15:38| We did meet with them several times and we tried to address as many of their concerns as we could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=8138)|
| 2:15:43| And they were very cordial, very professional in the way they handled everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=8143)|
| 2:15:47| I understand their concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=8147)|
| 2:15:49| The growth is booming in the Hardin Valley area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=8149)|
| 2:15:51| And this piece of property is one mile from the new middle school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=8151)|
| 2:15:57| This piece of property is 1.2 miles from Food City.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=8157)|
| 2:16:01| There are properties 3 to 3.5 miles further out on Hardin Valley Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=8161)|
| 2:16:06| They're equivalent to this same zoning request today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=8166)|
| 2:16:12| When we met with the citizens there, their primary concerns were obviously the intersection of Coward Mill and Sam Lee Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=8172)|
| 2:16:18| and East Herpin and Couch Mill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=8178)|
| 2:16:20| I'm sorry, Couch Mill and Sam Lee and then East Herpin and Couch Mill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=8180)|
| 2:16:24| We've agreed to widen East Herpin Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=8184)|
| 2:16:28| We've agreed to widen Couch Mill all the way down to Sam Lee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=8188)|
| 2:16:32| We've also agreed to work with Knox County Engineering to improve the intersection there at Sam Lee and Couch Mill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=8192)|
| 2:16:39| Potentially proposing to make that a three-way intersection would make it a lot safer there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=8199)|
| 2:16:44| Spot zoning is brought up all the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=8204)|
| 2:16:47| If you look at every single property throughout the Hardin Valley area, it would be considered spot zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=8207)|
| 2:16:54| The PR zoning that's one mile from this property, or excuse me, that's 610 football fields,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=8214)|
| 2:17:00| what is that, less than a mile, is zoned PR at three units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=8220)|
| 2:17:05| Still to this day, it's completely surrounded by agricultural zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=8225)|
| 2:17:09| That was zoned that way 15 years ago with Bob Money and Saddlebrook.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=8229)|
| 2:17:13| It is not spot zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=8233)|
| 2:17:15| To think that you're going to have zoning all the way around you rezoned prior to you being able to have your property rezoned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=8235)|
| 2:17:22| and that be considered spot zoning is out of character in my opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=8242)|
| 2:17:25| Now, Mr. Sanders, I think I need a clarification on something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=8245)|
| 2:17:29| Are we dealing just with the sector plan today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=8249)|
| 2:17:32| or can you all approve zoning contingent upon it going back to MPC?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=8252)|
| 2:17:38| Okay, so the county commission has two options today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=8258)|
| 2:17:42| One, they could initiate their own sector plan amendment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=8262)|
| 2:17:45| or two, deny the rezoning consistent with the current sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=8265)|
| 2:17:51| They don't have authority to approve the zoning without the consistent sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=8271)|
| 2:17:57| So to answer your question, the zoning is here because that's the only thing that you could appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=8277)|
| 2:18:03| They can't act on the zoning to approve it without a consistent sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=8283)|
| 2:18:07| Okay, Mr. Green, you may be able to help me here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=8287)|
| 2:18:13| When we go file an appeal there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=8293)|
| 2:18:16| is anybody advised or told that you can't apply for a rezoning appeal without applying for a sector plan amendment appeal?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=8296)|
| 2:18:28| Because of the legal requirements, and you and I discussed it this morning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=8308)|
| 2:18:34| the somewhat frustrating route it has to take, as Mr. Sanders pointed out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=8314)|
| 2:18:40| the commission can only, because of a decision made in a court case,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=8320)|
| 2:18:45| this commission can only consider the rezoning appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=8325)|
| 2:18:48| Then it has to go back through MPC for reconsideration of the sector plan amendment and the rezoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=8328)|
| 2:18:55| because, as Mr. Sanders said, a zoning change cannot be approved without the consistent sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=8335)|
| 2:19:02| All right, therein lies my argument.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=8342)|
| 2:19:04| What Mr. Green just said conflicts with what Mr. Sanders just said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=8344)|
| 2:19:09| I don't believe so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=8349)|
| 2:19:13| Okay, so today, are we asking for a sector plan amendment or are we asking for a rezoning?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=8353)|
| 2:19:21| If your ultimate goal is to have the property rezoned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=8361)|
| 2:19:24| the appropriate thing to request tonight would be for the commission to initiate a sector plan amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=8364)|
| 2:19:29| and return it to the Metropolitan Planning Commission for consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=8369)|
| 2:19:33| It would come back here in 60 days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=8373)|
| 2:19:36| and then the county commission could act on it to approve both the sector plan and the rezoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=8376)|
| 2:19:41| notwithstanding MPC's recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=8381)|
| 2:19:44| So technically we can't ask for rezoning tonight?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=8384)|
| 2:19:47| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=8387)|
| 2:19:49| Because it used to be, if I remember, sir, it used to be you could ask for rezoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=8389)|
| 2:19:53| and then that would be contingent upon the sector plan going back to MPC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=8393)|
| 2:19:57| and then the sector plan coming back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=8397)|
| 2:19:59| So basically, it's very confusing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=8399)|
| 2:20:02| It happens in these situations and it comes up quite a bit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=8402)|
| 2:20:05| because developers will pursue these sector plan amendments and rezonings in tandem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=8405)|
| 2:20:11| Essentially, if the commission so desires tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=8411)|
| 2:20:14| and sends it back to the Metropolitan Planning Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=8414)|
| 2:20:17| the rezoning will be waiting for you here when that sector plan amendment returns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=8417)|
| 2:20:24| so then they can act on them both at the same meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=8424)|
| 2:20:28| You can't have a rezoning that's inconsistent with the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=8428)|
| 2:20:34| So we can't vote on the rezoning tonight?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=8434)|
| 2:20:39| They could vote to deny it consistent with the existing sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=8439)|
| 2:20:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=8445)|
| 2:20:46| So what I need to, I guess, articulate to the best of my ability is why the sector plan amendment can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=8446)|
| 2:20:53| and possibly be considered to be sent back to MPC for reconsideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=8453)|
| 2:20:57| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=8457)|
| 2:20:58| And as I said a minute ago, if your goal is to have the property rezoned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=8458)|
| 2:21:02| the appropriate thing to request tonight would be for the commission to initiate a sector plan amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=8462)|
| 2:21:07| and request that MPC make recommendations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=8467)|
| 2:21:09| and it will come back here pursuant to the statute in 60 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=8469)|
| 2:21:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=8472)|
| 2:21:13| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=8473)|
| 2:21:14| So tonight I respectfully request you all consider a sector plan amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=8474)|
| 2:21:16| that would go back to MPC and then would come back to you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=8476)|
| 2:21:20| And with that, in the growth policy plan and make changes to the general plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=8480)|
| 2:21:26| you have to meet one of four criteria.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=8486)|
| 2:21:28| We meet at least three of those four criteria to amend the general plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=8488)|
| 2:21:32| which then goes to the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=8492)|
| 2:21:34| And the sector plan, to amend the sector plan, as I understand it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=8494)|
| 2:21:37| you have to have meet four criteria to be able to amend the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=8497)|
| 2:21:42| And in my opinion, we meet all four of those criteria to initiate a sector plan amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=8502)|
| 2:21:48| that would then go back to the Metropolitan Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=8508)|
| 2:21:51| So all I'm asking for tonight is respectfully consider a sector plan amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=8511)|
| 2:21:58| that would then go back to MPC that would then allow us to come back here for a rezoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=8518)|
| 2:22:02| based on MPC's decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=8522)|
| 2:22:06| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=8526)|
| 2:22:07| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=8527)|
| 2:22:08| Can I have a point of order?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=8528)|
| 2:22:09| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=8529)|
| 2:22:10| Was there a, Gerald, was there a sector plan amendment requested at the time of the rezoning?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=8530)|
| 2:22:15| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=8535)|
| 2:22:16| And it was denied as well?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=8536)|
| 2:22:17| Denied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=8537)|
| 2:22:18| But they didn't appeal that sector plan amendment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=8538)|
| 2:22:20| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=8540)|
| 2:22:21| Again, as Mr. Sanders pointed out, the challenges and the process is somewhat frustrating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=8541)|
| 2:22:27| They appealed the rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=8547)|
| 2:22:29| The commission, this commission can then go along with the Metropolitan Planning Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=8549)|
| 2:22:36| denying the rezoning or send it back or initiate, basically send it back to MPC by initiating a sector plan amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=8556)|
| 2:22:42| Could they have appealed the sector plan amendment that day at the same time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=8562)|
| 2:22:46| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=8566)|
| 2:22:47| No, they can't do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=8567)|
| 2:22:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=8568)|
| 2:22:50| So, and as you all are well aware, Hardin Valley, even since the sector plan was amended,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=8570)|
| 2:22:55| quite has changed in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=8575)|
| 2:22:58| I'm trying to get going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=8578)|
| 2:22:59| Oh, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=8579)|
| 2:23:03| You know, with the improvements to the Hardin Valley Road exit, with improvements to, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=8583)|
| 2:23:07| with the new school being built, we meet all the criteria for the, three of the four criteria| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=8587)|
| 2:23:13| for the growth policy change as well as all the criteria, in my opinion, for the initiation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=8593)|
| 2:23:17| of the sector plan amendment, which this body has done consistently over the past several months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=8597)|
| 2:23:23| And so I respectfully request your vote to amend the sector plan to go back to the Metropolitan Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=8603)|
| 2:23:38| The opposition had a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=8618)|
| 2:23:45| Good evening. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=8625)|
| 2:23:46| I'm Jeff Broyles, 2428 Caspian Drive, Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=8626)|
| 2:23:50| I'm here with the Hardin Valley community and my wife, which also owns a property at 11906 East Turpin Ring,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=8630)|
| 2:23:56| right across from this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=8636)|
| 2:23:58| Just quick four points to bring up, to add on to Kim's, Artie's statement so we don't rehash.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=8638)|
| 2:24:06| I did want to make sure we're talking apples and apples when we talk about a subdivision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=8646)|
| 2:24:10| Lancaster Ridge, being rezoned to LDR.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=8650)|
| 2:24:13| That is on an arterial road, and one mile in Hardin Valley does mean a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=8653)|
| 2:24:18| In this example, it does get it out of the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=8658)|
| 2:24:21| I do want to bring up that in this offer to widen East Turpin and Couchmilt,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=8661)|
| 2:24:28| that will widen the road and get into Deeds for Water Rights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=8668)|
| 2:24:33| If we go on the opposite side of the road, it gets into the property of a 119-year-old house there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=8673)|
| 2:24:39| on Couchmilt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=8679)|
| 2:24:41| We do know that at the end of the day, it's how you make the community feel when you make your decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=8681)|
| 2:24:47| But I also wanted to share that through the community, we also know that there's not going to be a hardship| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=8687)|
| 2:24:52| on this property, that there's additional offers on this property that can develop it with the correct| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=8692)|
| 2:24:59| agricultural zone and feel and culture of the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=8699)|
| 2:25:03| And also, the people behind me today represent more people than will actually live in the new subdivision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=8703)|
| 2:25:09| being considered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=8709)|
| 2:25:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=8710)|
| 2:25:11| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=8711)|
| 2:25:15| Commissioner Andrews?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=8715)|
| 2:25:17| Yeah, well, today is the first I've heard of the road improvement request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=8717)|
| 2:25:22| I know it was discussed at another time, but that's the first I've heard of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=8722)|
| 2:25:26| But Jim Snowden, do you care to come down?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=8726)|
| 2:25:40| You may not have done so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=8740)|
| 2:25:42| Have you all done?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=8742)|
| 2:25:43| You know, when I went out there, I went out there twice to the property just kind of, you know, Couchmilt| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=8743)|
| 2:25:48| and Sam Lee is almost a blind turn, left turn out of there, and then Turpin and Couchmilt is a struggle as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=8748)|
| 2:25:55| So have you all been out there to done any assessment or a cost of what it would take to bring that road up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=8755)|
| 2:26:02| to county standard?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=8762)|
| 2:26:04| We have not done any cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=8764)|
| 2:26:06| Our main concern would be, and Scott alluded to this, is the sight distance at Couchmilt looking, I guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=8766)|
| 2:26:14| to the east on Sam Lee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=8774)|
| 2:26:16| That is the only area that has limited sight distance from an intersection standpoint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=8776)|
| 2:26:22| It's kind of hard to say whether or not that's vegetation related or if it's actually the profile of the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=8782)|
| 2:26:27| That would be our main concern in regard to the access.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=8787)|
| 2:26:31| Have they presented you with any plans or has it just been a discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=8791)|
| 2:26:34| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=8794)|
| 2:26:35| At this point in time, they haven't submitted any plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=8795)|
| 2:26:37| It's just us being proactive to look at the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=8797)|
| 2:26:40| And if they wanted to bring, I don't think, I mean, if they wanted to bring Couchmilt and Sam Lee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=8800)|
| 2:26:46| I mean, it all had to be brought up to county spec, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=8806)|
| 2:26:49| If they wanted to widen it, it's county spec.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=8809)|
| 2:26:51| It's 22 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=8811)|
| 2:26:53| Yes, well, we'd request 20 feet of pavement, two 10-foot lanes for both Couchmilt and East Turpin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=8813)|
| 2:27:05| Do we have enough right-of-way to do that or would there be land acquisition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=8825)|
| 2:27:09| It's kind of hard to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=8829)|
| 2:27:11| The deeds along the east side of Turpin are unclear in their description.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=8831)|
| 2:27:18| However, on the west side of, I'm sorry, on the east side of Couchmilt,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=8838)|
| 2:27:22| on the west side of Couchmilt Road, there's four or five lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=8842)|
| 2:27:26| All those are lots of record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=8846)|
| 2:27:28| They have platted right-of-way of 25 feet from the center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=8848)|
| 2:27:31| So it looks like that's a possibility along Couchmilt, Turpin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=8851)|
| 2:27:36| Not really sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=8856)|
| 2:27:37| Those deeds are a little bit vague in regard to their description.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=8857)|
| 2:27:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=8862)|
| 2:27:45| Commissioner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=8865)|
| 2:27:46| Just, I think I may have a little bit of time left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=8866)|
| 2:27:49| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=8869)|
| 2:27:50| I know that's not correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=8870)|
| 2:27:51| You have about two minutes left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=8871)|
| 2:27:53| Yes, sir, and I'll make it brief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=8873)|
| 2:27:55| We do have an agreement with the property on East Turpin to buy the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=8875)|
| 2:27:59| to be able to widen the property on East Turpin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=8879)|
| 2:28:01| So we already have that in hand and have the agreement to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=8881)|
| 2:28:04| And also, you know, Mr. Van de Vecht's staff was requested through Mr. Snowden,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=8884)|
| 2:28:10| and they did a great job of going out there and getting all the information for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=8890)|
| 2:28:13| At the intersection of Couchmilt and Sam Lee, it's 30 miles per hour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=8893)|
| 2:28:17| The required sight distance would be 300 feet in each direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=8897)|
| 2:28:20| You have 350 feet in one direction and 270 feet in the other direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=8900)|
| 2:28:24| And part of that may be blocked because of vegetation overgrowth there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=8904)|
| 2:28:30| Commissioner Kenmaker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=8910)|
| 2:28:32| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=8912)|
| 2:28:33| I just wanted to make sure that Ms. Frazier understood what Mr. Davis was explaining| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=8913)|
| 2:28:41| and what he was asking the commission to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=8921)|
| 2:28:48| Does everybody that you're with your group understand what's going on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=8928)|
| 2:28:52| Can I say something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=8932)|
| 2:28:54| He doesn't have permission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=8934)|
| 2:28:56| You're going to have to come to the mic and give your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=8936)|
| 2:28:59| I'm Terry Burnett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=8939)|
| 2:29:00| I live at 1934 Couchmilt Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=8940)|
| 2:29:06| And the property that goes between Couchmilt and Turpin Lane is my driveway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=8946)|
| 2:29:14| and I'm not selling my driveway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=8954)|
| 2:29:16| So he does not have access over my property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=8956)|
| 2:29:21| I just wanted to make that clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=8961)|
| 2:29:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=8963)|
| 2:29:24| Are you on the east side or the west side of Couchmilt?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=8964)|
| 2:29:28| What's your address again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=8968)|
| 2:29:30| 11934.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=8970)|
| 2:29:34| If you're coming off of Couchmilt Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=8974)|
| 2:29:38| it's just a straight shot down that driveway to my house out at the very end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=8978)|
| 2:29:43| And the portion of the road that is paved, the county came in years ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=8983)|
| 2:29:49| and paved that when my dad was out of town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=8989)|
| 2:29:52| He wouldn't even let them put gravel on it before that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=8992)|
| 2:29:55| So that's not Turpin Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=8995)|
| 2:29:58| That's my driveway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=8998)|
| 2:30:00| And the sign on the Turpin Lane sign has broken arrows underneath that sign| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=9000)|
| 2:30:07| to indicate that there's a separation between the two county roads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=9007)|
| 2:30:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=9015)|
| 2:30:22| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=9022)|
| 2:30:23| To answer Mr. Schoonmaker's question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=9023)|
| 2:30:26| if Mr. Sanders could clearly provide an explanation just so that we know that they're all on the same page,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=9026)|
| 2:30:32| we would greatly appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=9032)|
| 2:30:35| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=9035)|
| 2:30:36| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=9036)|
| 2:30:37| So they understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=9037)|
| 2:30:38| That would be great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=9038)|
| 2:30:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=9039)|
| 2:30:40| So in order to change the permitted land use for this property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=9040)|
| 2:30:45| there will need to be a sector plan amendment, which is an amendment to the general plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=9045)|
| 2:30:49| which is a very high-level planning, long-term planning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=9049)|
| 2:30:52| And then there will also need to be a change in the zoning overlay for the piece of property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=9052)|
| 2:30:58| which is a very specific layer of planning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=9058)|
| 2:31:02| The way that the state sets up our land use authority and our zoning authority,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=9062)|
| 2:31:07| those two things, those levels of planning, have to be consistent with one another.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=9067)|
| 2:31:12| It gives the long-range planning authority in the first instance to the Metropolitan Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=9072)|
| 2:31:19| When the Metropolitan Planning Commission declines to amend that high level of planning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=9079)|
| 2:31:25| the long-term planning used to, there was no other option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=9085)|
| 2:31:31| It either started with MPC and MPC sent something to County Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=9091)|
| 2:31:36| or that was the end of the discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=9096)|
| 2:31:41| About eight or nine years ago, the state amended the statute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=9101)|
| 2:31:45| If MPC refuses to do something to amend the long-term planning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=9105)|
| 2:31:50| the County Commission can initiate a sector plan amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=9110)|
| 2:31:55| And so that's what's being requested today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=9115)|
| 2:31:58| Essentially, what happens there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=9118)|
| 2:32:00| the County Commission can initiate an amendment to that long-term planning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=9120)|
| 2:32:05| Under the statute, it goes to the Metropolitan Planning Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=9125)|
| 2:32:09| and it comes back to the County Commission in 60 days, essentially.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=9129)|
| 2:32:13| And so if that happens, that process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=9133)|
| 2:32:16| the County Commission can receive that back from the Metropolitan Planning Commission with recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=9136)|
| 2:32:23| It can adopt an amendment to the long-term planning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=9143)|
| 2:32:27| and then it can consider the short-term or the zoning amendment layer of planning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=9147)|
| 2:32:33| that will then be consistent with the long-term planning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=9153)|
| 2:32:36| So there's two layers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=9156)|
| 2:32:39| Each of them have to be consistent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=9159)|
| 2:32:41| You take the long-term planning first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=9161)|
| 2:32:43| If you get the long-term planning where you want it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=9163)|
| 2:32:45| then you can make the short-term planning change that's consistent with the long-term planning change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=9165)|
| 2:32:52| That's what's going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=9172)|
| 2:32:53| Metropolitan Planning Commission didn't adopt a sector plan amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=9173)|
| 2:32:58| So Mr. Davis and Ms. Healy are asking Commission to initiate their own long-term planning amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=9178)|
| 2:33:06| or sector plan amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=9186)|
| 2:33:08| And, you know, like I say, Commission has two options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=9188)|
| 2:33:12| You can initiate your own planning amendment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=9192)|
| 2:33:15| or you can deny the rezoning consistent with the current long-term planning amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=9195)|
| 2:33:22| or the current long-term planning situation, which was not amended by MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=9202)|
| 2:33:28| So that probably clears mud,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=9208)|
| 2:33:31| but it's the way that the state government sets up land use authority| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=9211)|
| 2:33:36| and gives that authority to the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=9216)|
| 2:33:40| Apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=9220)|
| 2:33:42| No, you're fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=9222)|
| 2:33:44| Mr. Davis?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=9224)|
| 2:33:45| Oh, no, I didn't know if there was a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=9225)|
| 2:33:48| Mr. Neissman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=9228)|
| 2:33:49| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=9229)|
| 2:33:51| Mr. Davis, I was just wanting to get a ‑‑ I've got the property area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=9231)|
| 2:33:55| I pulled up on my Google Maps and my street maps here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=9235)|
| 2:33:59| The gentleman had said that if you continue down Couch Mill, that hits his driveway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=9239)|
| 2:34:04| And I drove and took a look at that property Saturday afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=9244)|
| 2:34:08| So if you look at, I guess, is it Turpin Lane?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=9248)|
| 2:34:13| Am I pronouncing that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=9253)|
| 2:34:14| Yes, East Turpin, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=9254)|
| 2:34:15| Something like Terrapin, like a turtle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=9255)|
| 2:34:17| But if you take that right on Turpin Lane towards the property that we're talking about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=9257)|
| 2:34:24| on the right is that there's a white house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=9264)|
| 2:34:27| I saw a couple sitting on the front porch when I went by there on Saturday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=9267)|
| 2:34:32| Is that house the property that you're talking about buying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=9272)|
| 2:34:36| Is that the one you just mentioned?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=9276)|
| 2:34:39| Correct, yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=9279)|
| 2:34:40| We have an agreement to purchase the property there on the right‑hand side of East Turpin| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=9280)|
| 2:34:43| that will give us enough width to widen East Turpin Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=9283)|
| 2:34:46| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=9286)|
| 2:34:47| So if you kind of put access, would y'all sort of ‑‑ you've got the gentleman's driveway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=9287)|
| 2:34:51| which looks like more of an extension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=9291)|
| 2:34:53| So if y'all acquire that property, would that then be kind of cutting through where his front yard is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=9293)|
| 2:34:58| Are they going to move?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=9298)|
| 2:35:00| This may be micromanaging.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=9300)|
| 2:35:02| That would give you access, if you own that whole property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=9302)|
| 2:35:04| is that where most of the road would be expanded going down towards Sam Lee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=9304)|
| 2:35:09| Yeah, the intent would be to bring East Turpin, which comes in at a skewed angle now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=9309)|
| 2:35:13| the intent would be to bring East Turpin in perpendicular to Couch Mill,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=9313)|
| 2:35:17| which it should be for safety purposes anyways,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=9317)|
| 2:35:21| and we can buy enough property there on the right‑hand side to be able to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=9321)|
| 2:35:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=9327)|
| 2:35:28| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=9328)|
| 2:35:29| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=9329)|
| 2:35:32| Mr. Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=9332)|
| 2:35:33| One of the clarifications, Mr. Davis, 12,000, I guess it's Couch Mill, I don't think it's, well, I don't know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=9333)|
| 2:35:40| the corner, 12,000 and 12,002, are you buying both of those homes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=9340)|
| 2:35:44| or are you just buying what you need on the corner there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=9344)|
| 2:35:46| Just what we need on the corner, yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=9346)|
| 2:35:50| So that would, hypothetically, if you did that, you bought that corner, according to KGIS,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=9350)|
| 2:35:57| kind of a slanted hill, I mean, that would put the road, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=9357)|
| 2:36:01| the 25 feet of right‑of‑way would put that house 10 feet off the road, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=9361)|
| 2:36:07| Well, East Turpin, there is county right‑of‑way there on East Turpin,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=9367)|
| 2:36:11| Turpin, Turpin, how do you pronounce it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=9371)|
| 2:36:13| Turpin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=9373)|
| 2:36:14| Turpin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=9374)|
| 2:36:15| There is right‑of‑way there presently,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=9375)|
| 2:36:16| and so we would be purchasing enough additional right‑of‑way to be able to buy East Turpin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=9376)|
| 2:36:21| Once you pave the road, it's 25 foot from the middle, right, Jim?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=9381)|
| 2:36:24| I think we said 20 foot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=9384)|
| 2:36:26| 25 foot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=9386)|
| 2:36:29| Once you lay down a county road, it's 25 feet from the middle of the road, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=9389)|
| 2:36:33| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=9393)|
| 2:36:34| That would be the right‑of‑way dedication required.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=9394)|
| 2:36:36| That's on a new road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=9396)|
| 2:36:38| He's talking about widening of East Turpin would be 20 foot requirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=9398)|
| 2:36:41| Yes, Turpin would be 20 feet total from edge of pavement to edge of pavement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=9401)|
| 2:36:45| Right, but there's 25 feet from dead center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=9405)|
| 2:36:48| You've got 25 feet on each side is right‑of‑way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=9408)|
| 2:36:51| so let's say you put this roadway, it's going to be really close to 12,002 to the house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=9411)|
| 2:37:00| I guess what Commissioner Andrews is asking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=9420)|
| 2:37:02| does there have to be 50 foot of right‑of‑way for that classification of a road?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=9422)|
