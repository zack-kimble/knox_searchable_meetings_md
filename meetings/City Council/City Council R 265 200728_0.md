| 0:23:35| Okay, on these appeals we give the appellant up to three people who can speak in, in favor of the appeal for up to five minutes and then the appellee can people who oppose it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=1415)|

| 0:24:08| So Mr Mullins if you could, you know, go ahead. Are you on the call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=1448)|

| 0:24:21| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=1461)|
| 0:24:23| American can counsel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=1463)|
| 0:24:25| My name is Ben Mullins I'm at 550 West Main Street suite 500. I represent the appellants Baxter properties. Miss Baxter Reynolds is also on the line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=1465)|
| 0:24:37| She's available to answer any questions, as they may come up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=1477)|
| 0:24:43| This is an appeal I've sent that has a very long and complex procedural history.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=1483)|
| 0:24:49| It has been almost a year since the first application was filed. I did send a letter outlining the procedural history and sort of my arguments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=1489)|
| 0:25:05| Moving forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=1505)|
| 0:25:07| This property, as you know, is located at the corner of Sanders Drive and Tazewell Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=1507)|
| 0:25:18| The zoning in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=1518)|
| 0:25:21| The property in question is zero Sanders Drive. It is currently zoned RN4. It is adjacent to three other parcels also owned by Baxter properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=1521)|
| 0:25:32| One of those properties is 220 Adair. It is not part of this rezoning, although it was initially.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=1532)|
| 0:25:39| The two adjacent parcels to the east are zoned CG2. The sector plan and one year plan call for general commercial zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=1539)|
| 0:25:54| There was an intent to put a Fountain City beer garden on this parcel as part of that process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=1554)|
| 0:26:03| We worked with the neighborhood. We changed our design.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=1563)|
| 0:26:07| We amended our initial zoning from the CG zone to a neighborhood commercial zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=1567)|
| 0:26:17| Ultimately, when the planning staff did not recommend the CN zone for Sanders and 220 Adair, we withdrew the application for Adair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=1577)|
| 0:26:31| The beer garden decided it was going to look at different locations due to, in part, sort of the issues that we had getting this approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=1591)|
| 0:26:43| We sought only to rezone the parcel at zero Sanders Drive from RN4 to CG.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=1603)|
| 0:26:52| The reason we did that is because the CG zone is consistent with the current sector plan and one year plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=1612)|
| 0:27:04| It is a minor extension of the current zoning on the adjacent parcel owned by Baxter property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=1624)|
| 0:27:12| The intent to use this parcel as an accessory parking lot to the businesses on the 3029 Tazewell Pike property would benefit the Sweet Peas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=1632)|
| 0:27:29| which is under lease now to move into the old diner there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=1649)|
| 0:27:33| Also, Rita's is in need of additional parking. Parking is an issue in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=1653)|
| 0:27:40| Ultimately, our zoning was denied by a vote of 11 to 1 by the planning committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=1660)|
| 0:27:46| They were concerned about the intensity of a parking lot on that lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=1666)|
| 0:27:52| However, I did note, and this is all in my letter, that when we were looking to put the Fountain City Beer Garden on that location,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=1672)|
| 0:27:59| we initially wanted the parking lot to be on the 220 Adair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=1679)|
| 0:28:03| They had actually asked us to flip the concept so that the parking lot was actually on that Sanders Drive lot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=1683)|
| 0:28:10| so there would be no additional traffic coming onto Adair, which we were willing to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=1690)|
| 0:28:16| There was very little opposition. No one spoke at the planning commission meeting in opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=1696)|
| 0:28:22| There were a couple of emails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=1702)|
| 0:28:25| It's our position that because this property is under the one-year plan for general commercial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=1705)|
| 0:28:33| and the CG2 zone is consistent with the general commercial, that...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=1713)|
| 0:28:39| One minute left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=1719)|
| 0:28:41| I understand that it is appropriate for it to be zoned CG2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=1721)|
| 0:28:46| There are other zones that are allowed in the general commercial sector plan O and OP, CG, CH, and CR.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=1726)|
| 0:28:55| Most of those are commercial zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=1735)|
| 0:28:57| I think it's not accurate to say that the policy of the city does not want commercial zoning on this lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=1737)|
| 0:29:05| because the one-year plan, which was amended in May 2020 after this zoning came up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=1745)|
| 0:29:11| still called for this to be general commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=1751)|
| 0:29:14| Certainly, there are other zones that would be consistent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=1754)|
| 0:29:17| but I believe the one-year plan must be followed when making land use decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=1757)|
| 0:29:23| If it was the policy of the city to not allow commercial zoning, but something such as office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=1763)|
| 0:29:30| there are specific office designations for the one-year plan in the sector plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=1770)|
| 0:29:35| such as O or MDRO, medium density residential, that would be appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=1775)|
| 0:29:42| Thank you, Mr. Mullins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=1782)|
| 0:29:44| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=1784)|
| 0:29:45| That concludes your five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=1785)|
| 0:29:49| The next person who's signed up to speak in favor of this appeal is Ms. Jennifer Baxter Reynolds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=1789)|
| 0:29:56| Ms. Baxter Reynolds, are you on the call?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=1796)|
| 0:30:00| Yes, I'm here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=1800)|
| 0:30:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=1806)|
| 0:30:07| You'll have up to five minutes to speak on behalf of your appeal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=1807)|
| 0:30:14| and if you could start by saying your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=1814)|
| 0:30:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=1818)|
| 0:30:19| I'm going to yield my time to Ben Mullins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=1819)|
| 0:30:23| My name is Jennifer Reynolds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=1823)|
| 0:30:27| That's not permitted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=1827)|
| 0:30:30| Ben Mullins' mentor, Arthur Seymour, used to try that all the time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=1830)|
| 0:30:35| and Ben has learned it well, but you can't yield your time to somebody else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=1835)|
| 0:30:41| It's either your time or nobody's time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=1841)|
| 0:30:47| Ms. Reynolds, you still have up to five minutes to state your case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=1847)|
| 0:30:53| If you want to start, now's the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=1853)|
| 0:30:58| If you don't want to speak, that's okay, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=1858)|
| 0:31:01| Okay, sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=1861)|
| 0:31:02| My name is Jennifer Reynolds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=1862)|
| 0:31:04| I'm the owner of Baxter Properties, and we own those properties over in Fountain City.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=1864)|
| 0:31:09| We've owned them since 2013,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=1869)|
| 0:31:13| and I'm just hoping to make improvements for the businesses that are there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=1873)|
| 0:31:24| As Ben said, when we tried to get the beer garden in there before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=1884)|
| 0:31:30| they asked us to move the parking lot to the Zero Sanders Drive lot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=1890)|
| 0:31:34| and so now we're just attempting to use that as a parking lot for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=1894)|
| 0:31:39| businesses that are there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=1899)|
| 0:31:41| And so that was something that the neighborhood was okay with back then,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=1901)|
| 0:31:45| and that was even when we were using 220 Adair, which we have taken out now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=1905)|
| 0:31:50| But I don't really have much other to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=1910)|
| 0:31:56| just that we're trying to make the area good for the businesses that are there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=1916)|
| 0:32:04| and hopefully encourage more investment into the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=1924)|
| 0:32:09| and not run off other businesses that do want to go in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=1929)|
| 0:32:14| We have a lease signed with someone going into 3029 that's a restaurant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=1934)|
| 0:32:18| and they're very excited about moving into the Fountain City area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=1938)|
| 0:32:23| So hopefully we won't run them off because they don't have enough parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=1943)|
| 0:32:29| But that's really all I have to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=1949)|
| 0:32:33| Thank you, Ms. Reynolds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=1953)|
| 0:32:35| Could we get your address, Ms. Reynolds?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=1955)|
| 0:32:38| My business address?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=1958)|
| 0:32:41| That's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=1961)|
| 0:32:42| Any address you want to give us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=1962)|
| 0:32:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=1963)|
| 0:32:44| It's 220 Lawton Boulevard, L-A-W-T-O-N.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=1964)|
| 0:32:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=1969)|
| 0:32:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=1970)|
| 0:32:51| Thank you, Ms. Reynolds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=1971)|
| 0:32:52| There's one person signed up to speak against the appeal, Mr. Matt McMillan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=1972)|
| 0:32:59| Mr. McMillan, are you on the call?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=1979)|

| 0:33:11| Yep, we can hear you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=1991)|
| 0:33:12| Mr. McMillan, you'll have up to five minutes to speak to this matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=1992)|

| 0:33:33| to speak on behalf of our neighborhood in Fountain City, situated between Broadway and Tazewell Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=2013)|
| 0:33:39| Our neighborhood started in the 1920s and is one of unique nationally registered historic homes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=2019)|
| 0:33:44| that are affordable for our diverse residents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=2024)|
| 0:33:47| Over the past 30-plus years, this old Knoxville neighborhood has been encroached on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=2027)|

| 0:33:54| often through a method of tearing down our homes without notice,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=2034)|
| 0:33:57| then later seeking a change in zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=2037)|
| 0:34:00| It was these same such actions that occurred again last year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=2040)|
| 0:34:03| as Baxter Properties purchased a residence at 220 Adair Drive, tore it down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=2043)|
| 0:34:09| and soon after began a process to try and rezone it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=2049)|
| 0:34:12| along with other adjoining property for commercial use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=2052)|
| 0:34:15| We have since been back and forth in discussion and negotiations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=2055)|
| 0:34:19| to make the best use of the properties in development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=2059)|
| 0:34:22| We'll try to ensure we protect our neighborhood and find a lasting resolution for our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=2062)|
| 0:34:27| This intersection of Tazewell, Jackborough, and Sanders, where the properties are located,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=2067)|
| 0:34:31| serves as a gateway and transition to two-lane roads that lead to Adair Gardens| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=2071)|
| 0:34:36| and many other nearby neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=2076)|
| 0:34:39| The CG Zoning Baxter Properties continues to work toward is more appropriate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=2079)|
| 0:34:44| for the four-lane Broadway Highway, which is the commercial node and corridor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=2084)|
| 0:34:48| that the CG Commercial Zoning District is intended to provide for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=2088)|
| 0:34:53| as stated in the zoning code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=2093)|
| 0:34:55| Instead, Adair Gardens supports and would encourage a change to CN zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=2095)|
| 0:35:00| for the properties at 3029 Tazewell Pike and 0 Sanders Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=2100)|
| 0:35:05| It would also likely make sense to include their properties at 3019 and 3021 Tazewell Pike| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=2105)|
| 0:35:11| in the change as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=2111)|
| 0:35:13| This would ensure a consistent zoning at all corners of the intersection,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=2113)|
| 0:35:17| along with all the connected Baxter property parcels in discussion tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=2117)|
| 0:35:22| CN aligns with the new zoning districts and allows an eating and drinking establishment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=2122)|
| 0:35:27| along with the other low-impact businesses that have historically been on these properties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=2127)|
| 0:35:32| and in which Baxter Properties is actively recruiting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=2132)|
| 0:35:36| Instead of patching the problem of creating additional parking for a new tenant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=2136)|
| 0:35:40| we can move forward in the spirit of the new zoning vision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=2140)|
| 0:35:43| provide the parking their new tenant desires,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=2143)|
| 0:35:46| allow the existing types of businesses to continue to exist,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=2146)|
| 0:35:50| and set the appropriate zoning requirements for the long-term future of these properties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=2150)|
| 0:35:54| that abut our neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=2154)|
| 0:35:56| In a meeting with Gerald Green on August 22, 2019,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=2156)|
| 0:36:00| he did not consider the original plan presented, one with a parking lot on 220 Adair Drive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=2160)|
| 0:36:07| a request that would be able to get approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=2167)|
| 0:36:10| We have since then worked in the spirit of making the best of an unfortunate situation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=2170)|
| 0:36:14| and continue to seek a compromise fair to everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=2174)|
| 0:36:17| We hope to continue to work with Baxter Properties to find solutions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=2177)|
| 0:36:21| that will not diminish historic Adair Gardens| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=2181)|
| 0:36:24| and allow for the smartest uses of their properties for our neighborhood and community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=2184)|
| 0:36:28| However, this evening we need to set a reasonable zoning limit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=2188)|
| 0:36:32| so whomever may own these properties, now and in the future,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=2192)|
| 0:36:35| can bring in the types of businesses that are appropriate for our neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=2195)|
| 0:36:40| If this appeal is voted through, the barriers undoing these actions in the future are ever higher,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=2200)|
| 0:36:45| much like the irreversible nature of tearing down of our historic homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=2205)|
| 0:36:50| The Adair Gardens Residents Association therefore encourages you to vote to deny this appeal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=2210)|
| 0:36:56| and let us continue our dialogue with Baxter Properties to address each side's needs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=2216)|
| 0:37:00| in a manner that is not a patch, but a long-term solution both sides can be comfortable knowing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=2220)|
| 0:37:06| that it will be a benefit for the value of our properties and community as a whole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=2226)|
| 0:37:10| In closing, I would like to take a final moment to extend our gratitude to Councilwoman Ryder| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=2230)|
| 0:37:16| for her tireless efforts working with both sides to come to an amicable resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=2236)|
| 0:37:21| She has been on the ground since day one and we could not have worked through this process without her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=2241)|
| 0:37:26| Thank you, Lauren.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=2246)|
| 0:37:28| Thank you as well to the rest of this body for your time and thoughtful consideration of this matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=2248)|
| 0:37:33| We know you'll be able to help us forward a resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=2253)|
| 0:37:42| Thank you, Mr. McMillan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=2262)|
| 0:37:44| Councilmembers, is there a motion on this appeal?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=2264)|
| 0:37:48| Councilmember Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=2268)|
| 0:37:50| Before I make a motion, I think Mr. Mullins has a rebuttal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=2270)|
| 0:37:57| Oh, right, a rebuttal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=2277)|
| 0:37:58| He has rebuttals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=2278)|
| 0:37:59| Now, Mr. Mullins, you have an opportunity to rebut the arguments you just heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=2279)|
| 0:38:10| Yes, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=2290)|
| 0:38:11| Up to two minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=2291)|
| 0:38:12| Sorry, I forgot about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=2292)|
| 0:38:14| Thank you, Mr. Johnson, for catching that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=2294)|
| 0:38:18| Okay, go ahead, Mr. Mullins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=2298)|
| 0:38:22| You have up to two minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=2302)|
| 0:38:24| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=2304)|
| 0:38:25| First, I would point out that, yes, we have worked with the neighborhood and we'll continue to work with the neighborhood to work on what makes the most sense for this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=2305)|
| 0:38:38| The option of rezoning this to neighborhood commercial was something that we considered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=2318)|
| 0:38:44| It was something we looked at with the beer garden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=2324)|
| 0:38:46| It was the recommendation of planning staff at CN was still too intense for this piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=2326)|
| 0:38:56| Our solution is to follow the policy that the city of Knoxville has already adopted, and that's follow the one-year plan, the sector plan currently in place for this property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=2336)|
| 0:39:06| and leaving the property at 220 Adair as a residential zone to be a buffer to the historic neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=2346)|
| 0:39:14| Yes, there was a home on that property that is owned by Baxter Properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=2354)|
| 0:39:19| It was demolished after following the proper channels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=2359)|
| 0:39:22| We applied for a permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=2362)|
| 0:39:24| It went through the moratorium required, and then we were provided authority to demolish that property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=2364)|
| 0:39:33| It is a buffer zone and will remain a buffer zone to the gardens,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=2373)|
| 0:39:39| but we don't feel like we are required to down zone property to the east in order to use this property in a way that the neighborhood has already addressed and consented to for additional business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=2379)|
| 0:39:57| And that is our use that we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=2397)|
| 0:40:02| I'd ask that you follow the policy set by the one-year plan, follow the policy set by the sector plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=2402)|
| 0:40:07| and rezone this to the general commercial zone as it is earmarked for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=2407)|
| 0:40:15| OK, thank you, Mr. Mullins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=2415)|
| 0:40:17| So, council members, you heard the appellant and appellee and the rebuttal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=2417)|
| 0:40:22| Ms. Ryder, you have the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=2422)|
| 0:40:24| You want to make some comments before a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=2424)|
| 0:40:27| Yes, I do want to start with thanking both sides for endless meetings over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=2427)|
| 0:40:34| I think we're over a 12-month period at this point, many of them on Sunday night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=2434)|
| 0:40:41| I'd like to thank Ms. Baxter, Mr. Mullins, the folks at the beer garden, the neighbors worked with, and we're ready to welcome them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=2441)|
| 0:40:51| And unfortunately, due to COVID and other factors, negotiations stalled out and ended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=2451)|
| 0:40:59| I'd like to call on Ms. Brooks to comment on the fact that what is allowed in the one-year plan as it exists,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=2459)|
| 0:41:09| and the current zoning and the recommendation made by the planning commission, which was voted on for a denial of 12-1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=2469)|
| 0:41:18| Ms. Brooks, acting director of the planning department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=2478)|
| 0:41:24| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=2484)|
| 0:41:25| Knox County Planning, sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=2485)|
| 0:41:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=2487)|
| 0:41:29| Good evening, council members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=2489)|
| 0:41:31| I'll start off by, we will have this in front of you, but the recommendation by the planning commission was to deny the CGE zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=2491)|
| 0:41:41| because it allows commercial uses that were too intense to be located at this interior intersection of what is considered a stable in Montgomery neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=2501)|
| 0:41:54| And when the planning staff and planning commission are reviewing these requests, they're not just looking at the use that is being presented by the applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=2514)|
| 0:42:05| We have to look at the entire set of uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=2525)|
| 0:42:08| So the CGE zone allows some commercial uses that really are too intense to be located at the entry to this small lot single-family residential neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=2528)|
| 0:42:19| And so they really, so when we look at these rezoning, they really need to be based on the entire range of uses that are allowed within a zone to ensure that any development that's brought forth in the future| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=2539)|
| 0:42:29| would continue to be compatible with the surrounding land uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=2549)|
| 0:42:33| And so, and with that, the one-year plan and the sector plan do identify several different zones that are permitted in the general commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=2553)|
| 0:42:45| But these are not all just because you have that general commercial designation doesn't mean that all of these zones that are permitted in that land use designation makes sense for every piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=2565)|
| 0:43:00| So as Mr. Mullins pointed out, that in the city, under the general commercial, you can have office, you can have an office park, you can have the CGE zone, and you can have highway commercial as well as regional commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=2580)|
| 0:43:14| So when looking at this piece of property, it was the recommendation of the planning commission that these more higher intensity commercial zones would not be appropriate on this piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=2594)|
| 0:43:29| And that would include the CGE.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=2609)|
| 0:43:34| Okay, Ms. Brooks, thank you very much. Ms. Ryder, did you have any further comments or questions before we open it up for questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=2614)|
| 0:43:43| So, Ms. Brooks, what zoning would be allowed that would be more appropriate with the current one-year plan designation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=2623)|
| 0:43:54| So a less intense zone such as the office or neighborhood commercial could be a more appropriate transition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=2634)|
| 0:44:01| The office zoning district is intended to provide that transition between single-family residential neighborhoods and that more intensely developed commercial zone that you see along Kingston Pike and some of our other major corridors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=2641)|
| 0:44:19| And Mr. Mullins did mention that they had previously requested neighborhood commercial, but when that was before the planning commission, 220 Adair was still part of that request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=2659)|
| 0:44:34| And at that time, extending that commercial further into the neighborhood really didn't make sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=2674)|
| 0:44:46| Ms. Ryder, any further?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=2686)|
| 0:44:51| I want to go ahead and make a motion to deny, but I leave, as stated by the speaker, all opportunities open to continue conversations with the applicants and their attorney for a zoning that works next to residential as a buffer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=2691)|
| 0:45:13| Okay, motion made to deny the appeal. Is there a second to the motion, Ms. Testerman? Are you raising your hand to second that motion or do you want to be recognized?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=2713)|
| 0:45:22| I had a couple of questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=2722)|
| 0:45:25| Well, let's get a second on the motion to deny and then I'll give the floor to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=2725)|
| 0:45:31| Mr. Thomas, you're seconding the motion to deny. Okay. Motion made by Council Member Ryder, seconded by Council Member Thomas. Ms. Testerman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=2731)|
| 0:45:41| So, a couple of questions and I'm not sure who the appropriate person is, which side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=2741)|
| 0:45:48| So, as mentioned, Sweet Peas has already signed a lease agreement on the Tazewell Pike side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=2748)|
| 0:45:58| Do they currently, within that current lease agreement, do they have enough parking on the current parcel that they're leasing or is it contingent on rezoning the Sanders property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=2758)|
| 0:46:22| I don't know who's best directed, if that's Ms. Brooks or the property owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=2782)|
| 0:46:31| Mr. Mullins is raising his hand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=2791)|
| 0:46:34| Who?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=2794)|
| 0:46:35| Mr. Mullins is raising his hand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=2795)|
| 0:46:37| Okay, Mr. Mullins, could you respond to Council Member Testerman's question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=2797)|
| 0:46:42| Yes, thank you, Council Member Testerman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=2802)|
| 0:46:45| The parking they currently have complies with the zoning ordinance for use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=2805)|
| 0:46:51| So, legally, they have enough parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=2811)|
| 0:46:54| Now, would they like to have additional parking?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=2814)|
| 0:46:57| Yes, they would, and it also would help serve the other businesses on that CG zone that sometimes have issues with parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=2817)|
| 0:47:07| So, there's the minimum parking allowed and what a business would like to have as parking, and that's what we're looking at here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=2827)|
| 0:47:15| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=2835)|
| 0:47:17| And then another question, and Councilwoman Ryder mentioned this as well in reading through the documentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=2837)|
| 0:47:26| You know, when the beer market was going to go into that, the neighborhood brought the recommendation to switch Adair Drive with Sanders for parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=2846)|
| 0:47:38| And then she said that the neighborhood was ready to welcome them there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=2858)|
| 0:47:45| And I guess I'm just curious, I know COVID happened, but I'm just curious if that was the neighborhood's recommendation, and now they've even taken Adair off the table as part of the zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=2865)|
| 0:47:57| I'm just curious what happened in that negotiation that killed the deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=2877)|
| 0:48:06| If Mr. Mullins wants to comment on that, my understanding was there was a back and forth, and the last thing submitted by the neighborhood was deal is off because the beer and beer market was leaving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=2886)|
| 0:48:30| So, the neighborhood at that point was ready to come back and say, where can we negotiate? What's the sticking point?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=2910)|
| 0:48:36| But my understanding was the beer market had already backed out at that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=2916)|
| 0:48:42| Mr. Mullins or Mr. McMillan, either of you wish to speak to this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=2922)|
| 0:48:50| Yes, I can address that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=2930)|
| 0:48:54| I mean, it wasn't because of COVID that this happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=2934)|
| 0:49:01| It was because of the back and forth, and we couldn't reach a deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=2941)|
| 0:49:04| COVID made it more difficult.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=2944)|
| 0:49:05| We couldn't no longer have in-person meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=2945)|
| 0:49:08| We were trying to go through a single individual who was then trying to round up a number of different people in the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=2948)|
| 0:49:18| But, I mean, ultimately, while that process was going on, we got the recommendation from planning staff that the neighborhood commercial would not be appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=2958)|
| 0:49:28| And they didn't draw a distinction between the zero Sanders drive request nor the 220 Adair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=2968)|
| 0:49:37| In fact, they didn't think that the sector plan or one-year plan amendment for neighborhood commercial would be appropriate as well in their recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=2977)|
| 0:49:45| So, I mean, ultimately, you know, it just didn't make sense to keep going with the beer garden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=2985)|
| 0:49:52| It put a lot of time and energy into it, and they wanted to move on somewhere else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=2992)|
| 0:49:58| And we wanted to look at, okay, what uses, what can we do with the property as it is with regard to the current one-year plan and sector plan that's in place?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=2998)|
| 0:50:08| What's consistent with the policy that the city of Knoxville had adopted all the way back in 2007 and reaffirmed as late as May of 2020 with regard to the one-year plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=3008)|
| 0:50:21| And the neighborhood commercial is now not an option for Sanders?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=3021)|
| 0:50:28| You know, I don't know if staff would now change their recommendation just for Sanders or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=3028)|
| 0:50:37| There was conversations the last couple of days with Ms. Ryder and myself about, you know, potentially a neighborhood commercial for Sanders and for the Tazewell Pike properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=3037)|
| 0:50:52| But, of course, that would require us to go back through the process to effectively downzone property that's already zoned CG commercial with uses that are consistent with that zone and even go through a special use process through the planning commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=3052)|
| 0:51:11| Now, while everybody's on board with that, you know, that may go through without a hitch, but none of this is guaranteed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=3071)|
| 0:51:19| And so there's risk in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=3079)|
| 0:51:21| There's risk even if the community says they're in support of it now, that can change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=3081)|
| 0:51:25| In fact, that did change as part of this process, which is why you'll see in my letter, I mean, initially there was neighborhood investment in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=3085)|
| 0:51:34| And then more people became aware, more people became opposed to it, and the people that were in support of it, you know, became silent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=3094)|
| 0:51:44| Mr. McMillan has also raised his hand if Council wishes to call on him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=3104)|
| 0:51:49| Ms. Testerman, did you have any, do you want to hear from Mr. McMillan right now, or do you have something that you wanted to add right at the moment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=3109)|
| 0:51:56| I'm willing to hear from him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=3116)|
| 0:51:59| Mr. McMillan, and then I'll go back to Ms. Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=3119)|
| 0:52:03| Mr. McMillan, you have some response to the conversation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=3123)|
| 0:52:07| Yes, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=3127)|
| 0:52:08| Yeah, we, I mean, so we're, Patrick O'Neill, one of our, the lawyer that lives in our neighborhood, did a great job leading our steering committee through this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=3128)|
| 0:52:18| And as this kind of wrapped up recently, as you've seen the letter that's been passed around to all your Council members, he's kind of been stepping away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=3138)|
| 0:52:28| So, as there's been a transition, yes, I mean, Mr. Mullins is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=3148)|
| 0:52:34| There's definitely been more awareness, more opinions coming in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=3154)|
| 0:52:39| It's a large neighborhood, but, you know, we have to wrangle, but the willingness is still there to work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=3159)|
| 0:52:45| Our biggest concern is future-proofing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=3165)|
| 0:52:48| We don't know who thinks, you know, who's going to own this in the future, what business rights are going to be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=3168)|
| 0:52:54| That continues to be kind of this big concern and getting proper zoning in place to make sure whoever owns this down the line, you know, plays by the right rules that fit for our neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=3174)|
| 0:53:07| As I mentioned in my opening statement, unfortunately, our neighborhoods relive this time and time again over the years of losing our homes to commercial interest, you know, almost without notice, without buy-in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=3187)|
| 0:53:22| And we just want to make sure that we're taking the time to go through the right channels and continue to talk through it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=3202)|
| 0:53:29| And our concern with allowing this appeal, allowing the more aggressive zoning in there that's not really a fit, as seen by the CN at all other corners of the intersection, that we're leaving ourselves exposed for yet another incident of destruction to our neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=3209)|
| 0:53:49| So we do want to keep the door open and hope we can go back and spend a little extra time to get it right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=3229)|
| 0:53:59| Thank you, Mr. McMillan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=3239)|
| 0:54:02| Ms. Ryder, you've got to unmute yourself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=3242)|
| 0:54:09| I know, and I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=3249)|
| 0:54:11| Mr. Johnson said I have feedback.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=3251)|
| 0:54:13| I have a lot of fans going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=3253)|
| 0:54:14| My attic is not that cool.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=3254)|
| 0:54:17| And I missed my button to push.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=3257)|
| 0:54:22| So, the rest, the restaurant space can be used as is without a rezoning request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=3262)|
| 0:54:29| This is a rezoning request that was denied at the Planning Commission 12 to one to add additional parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=3269)|
| 0:54:39| We have been in conversations over the past 24 hours between Mr. Brooks, Mr. Mullins, myself, and his client, and the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=3279)|
| 0:54:48| The letters to the Planning Commission emails to counsel from neighborhood representatives and from the neighborhood organization, our request for commercial neighborhood zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=3288)|
| 0:55:00| I have also said I will support that and I will make a council request for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=3300)|
| 0:55:06| I support that, and that is a way to get them the parking that they need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=3306)|
| 0:55:11| The issue with office, which is allowed in that one-year plan designation, it does not get them the parking that they need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=3311)|
| 0:55:20| And the issue is they have to one-lot the parcel with the existing restaurant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=3320)|
| 0:55:25| So, there's multiple steps involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=3325)|
| 0:55:28| But my word is I support that, and the neighborhood has already put themselves out there to support that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=3328)|
| 0:55:33| So, I cannot support the general commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=3333)|
| 0:55:36| If you read our zoning code, it says general commercial is not suitable for next to residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=3336)|
| 0:55:43| And the commercial neighborhood is designed for that, and office as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=3343)|
| 0:55:47| Those are both considered buffer zones for next to residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=3347)|
| 0:55:50| And those are both things that we could support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=3350)|
| 0:55:53| But in terms of this particular request, I vote to – my motion was to deny this request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=3353)|
| 0:56:01| Thank you for clarifying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=3361)|
| 0:56:03| And thanks for your work on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=3363)|
| 0:56:05| I hope that both sides can certainly come back together and come to a resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=3365)|
| 0:56:11| Any further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=3371)|
| 0:56:14| Okay, Ms. Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=3374)|
| 0:56:17| All of my questions were answered throughout that discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=3377)|
| 0:56:22| I just wanted to add to the discussion that I recognize the difficulties because that's an area of town that I've spent a lot of time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=3382)|
| 0:56:38| really enjoyed the Fountain City Diner, and there is limited parking there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=3398)|
| 0:56:42| I've had difficulties in the past, so I definitely see the concern there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=3402)|
| 0:56:46| And I also see the neighborhood's concern because that can be a really tight area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=3406)|
| 0:56:50| Hopefully one day it will be a walkable area, but a lot of traffic right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=3410)|
| 0:56:54| So like Councilwoman Testerman said, I hope the two parties can find a resolution because I see valid concerns coming from both parties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=3414)|
| 0:57:06| Thank you, Councilmember Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=3426)|
| 0:57:08| Any further discussion or questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=3428)|
| 0:57:12| Seeing none, the motion on the floor is to deny the appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=3432)|
| 0:57:15| Mr. Johnson, please conduct a roll call vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=3435)|
| 0:57:18| Councilwoman Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=3438)|
| 0:57:22| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=3442)|
| 0:57:24| Councilman Roberto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=3444)|
| 0:57:26| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=3446)|
| 0:57:27| Councilwoman Singh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=3447)|
| 0:57:29| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=3449)|
| 0:57:30| Councilman Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=3450)|
| 0:57:32| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=3452)|
| 0:57:33| Councilwoman Testerman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=3453)|
| 0:57:34| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=3454)|
| 0:57:36| Councilman Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=3456)|
| 0:57:38| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=3458)|
| 0:57:39| Councilwoman Fugate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=3459)|
| 0:57:41| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=3461)|
| 0:57:43| Vice Mayor McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=3463)|
| 0:57:45| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=3465)|
| 0:57:46| And Councilwoman Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=3466)|
| 0:57:48| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=3468)|
| 0:57:51| Motion carries 9-0.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=3471)|
| 0:57:54| Council, before we get to the resolutions, I just wanted to mention that we have several people signed up to speak to various items under our resolutions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=3474)|
| 0:58:09| And I'm following your own rules that, you know, the rules that you all have set, which say three people for, three people against.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=3489)|
| 0:58:19| So in the instances when there's more than three, I would encourage the people signed up to try to coordinate and choose the three people that you think would best represent your case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=3499)|
| 0:58:33| So that's how I'm going to proceed unless I hear otherwise from Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=3513)|
| 0:58:37| And I'd like for us to continue to suspend our rules until we're able to review those and come to an agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=3517)|
| 0:58:45| Because like Vice Mayor McKenzie said at our workshop, that has become our norm now at meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=3525)|
| 0:58:53| I don't think the public has had time to coordinate ahead of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=3533)|
| 0:58:58| And I don't know if that's now that I would make that motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=3538)|
| 0:59:04| Well, first, maybe it would help if Mr. Frost could give us an overview of the rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=3544)|
| 0:59:08| Because there's some people wonder why we ask for the address that's in the policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=3548)|
| 0:59:13| I'm not talking about like, you know, extensive review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=3553)|
| 0:59:16| But, Mr. Frost, can you just give an overview?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=3556)|
| 0:59:19| Sure, I'm saying it correctly that it's three for, three against, up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=3559)|
| 0:59:25| You're supposed to state your name and address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=3565)|
| 0:59:28| You're not supposed to use profanity, things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=3568)|
| 0:59:32| Yes, Mayor, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=3572)|
| 0:59:35| That is more or less Rule 18, the order of debate that's codified in the City Code of Ordinances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=3575)|
| 0:59:46| It is, there are a number of requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=3586)|
| 0:59:50| The people who are wishing to address are supposed to give their name and address and the subject on which they wish to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=3590)|
| 1:00:01| Each person is permitted to speak for five minutes and shall not have more than one time to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=3601)|
| 1:00:11| That's what Mr. Swanson alluded to on the earlier matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=3611)|
| 1:00:16| And it's members of the public as well as council members shall remember that they're in a council meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=3616)|
| 1:00:24| and that they are to show proper respect to each other and shall maintain a proper decorum in the meeting at all times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=3624)|
| 1:00:32| People who fall, excuse me, people who fail to observe the rules as the proper decorum shall not be permitted to speak| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=3632)|
| 1:00:40| and may be removed from the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=3640)|
| 1:00:45| That's the summation of that rule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=3645)|
| 1:00:48| I would note that, you know, if rules are going to be suspended and that's obviously a decision for council to make,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=3648)|
| 1:00:57| make sure there's not an unfair weighting of people on one side of the issue as opposed to the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=3657)|
| 1:01:06| So there's not a minority number of people that don't get to speak simply because they're outweighed by the number on the other side of the issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=3666)|
| 1:01:24| I'm a little confused by what you just said, like about the outlet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=3684)|
| 1:01:28| Like let's say there's an item where there's six people who signed up to, you know, to speak in favor and two against.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=3688)|
| 1:01:36| Right. Well, my point there to clarify is that if you suspend the rules to allow six people five minutes each versus two people at five minutes each,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=3696)|
| 1:01:51| is that is that fair and equitable to the people on the where there are only two of them in one position?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=3711)|
| 1:02:04| Ms. Jugut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=3724)|
| 1:02:06| Thank you, Madam Chair, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=3726)|
| 1:02:10| It's been my experience in Parliamentary procedure that for rules of debate, it is supposed to be an even number for or against.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=3730)|
| 1:02:21| I belong to various national organizations and when things like that occur, it is supposed to be an even number for the argument.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=3741)|
| 1:02:30| So I assume that is why council adopted those rules a number of years back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=3750)|
| 1:02:36| Mr. Swanson, I don't know if you wanted to say something about that or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=3756)|
| 1:02:41| Mr. Swanson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=3761)|
| 1:02:43| If I can figure out how to unmute myself, then I will speak to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=3763)|
| 1:02:47| I think what Mr. Frost is referring to in terms of fairness is these are rules that are published and codified and have been in effect for a number of years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=3767)|
| 1:02:58| And the public is deemed to know the law as it currently exists.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=3778)|
| 1:03:02| And it currently exists is that they're up to three speakers on each side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=3782)|
| 1:03:07| And so people come or sign up for council meetings and intend to abide by the rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=3787)|
| 1:03:14| Those who do intend to abide by the rules and get together and pick their best three people to speak on a particular issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=3794)|
| 1:03:24| And then they have eight or nine people on the other side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=3804)|
| 1:03:27| That's really not fair to them because they followed the rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=3807)|
| 1:03:31| And so I think that's what Mr. Frost was speaking to in terms of fairness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=3811)|
| 1:03:35| Because these rules are published.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=3815)|
| 1:03:37| They are known by the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=3817)|
| 1:03:39| And they are the rules that council has come up with and generally ought to be followed unless council decides to come up with other rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=3819)|
| 1:03:48| I believe these rules are fairly new because they're new to me as a member of the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=3828)|
| 1:03:55| This idea of three people on each side of an issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=3835)|
| 1:04:02| This is not a quasi hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=3842)|
| 1:04:05| This is hearing from the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=3845)|
| 1:04:08| All of the public that we work with are not necessarily organized into groups.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=3848)|
| 1:04:14| And so I believe we should hear from all of the people who want to speak on an issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=3854)|
| 1:04:21| This is not a debate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=3861)|
| 1:04:23| It's a discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=3863)|
| 1:04:24| Mr. Swanson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=3864)|
| 1:04:26| With regard to the newness of the rules, I don't know exactly when they were adopted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=3866)|
| 1:04:31| I can tell you I was city council's attorney over, I guess, nine years ago now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=3871)|
| 1:04:38| I was city council's attorney for 26 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=3878)|
| 1:04:41| And those rules were in effect for all 26 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=3881)|
| 1:04:44| So I don't think they're all that new.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=3884)|
| 1:04:46| Well, I would say we've suspended them quite often then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=3886)|
| 1:04:50| Because I know I spoke on issues where I was not just one of three people to speak on a side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=3890)|
| 1:04:56| Thank you, Ms. Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=3896)|
| 1:04:58| Ms. Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=3898)|
| 1:05:02| I was just going to say, I know they're not new, because I've spoken on issues at council before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=3902)|
| 1:05:06| And these are in our ordinances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=3906)|
| 1:05:09| And it was you picked your best three speakers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=3909)|
| 1:05:13| The one thing that is different in this forum, I'll say, is when you speak at the podium and you have your three speakers, you can say, everyone that's supporting this position, please stand now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=3913)|
| 1:05:26| And so you're able to show your numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=3926)|
| 1:05:29| I will also add that everyone has the opportunity to call and email us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=3929)|
| 1:05:35| I even had somebody call me at 1039 p.m. last night to give me their opinion on an agenda item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=3935)|
| 1:05:43| And I spent an hour in a Zoom meeting with someone getting their points of view on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=3943)|
| 1:05:47| So there's plenty of ways for people to contact us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=3947)|
| 1:05:51| It's just been mostly been yesterday and today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=3951)|
| 1:05:56| So, council, if you want to, if there's a motion, you know, I'm going to proceed following your rules, because that's what I've been told is the right thing to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=3956)|
| 1:06:07| If you choose to do something else, let me know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=3967)|
| 1:06:11| Well, I'll make a motion to suspend our rules on limiting the number of public speakers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=3971)|
| 1:06:18| Okay, motion made by Council Member Parker to suspend the rules on limiting the number of speakers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=3978)|
| 1:06:24| Is there a second to the motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=3984)|
| 1:06:29| Okay, seeing no motion to second it, the motion fails for lack of a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=3989)|
| 1:06:34| I'll continue on with item 11A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=3994)|
| 1:06:38| Council, I can report that the persons were warned that they may not get a chance to speak if they were in excess of the normally allowed speakers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=3998)|
| 1:06:48| So they were warned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=4008)|
| 1:06:50| Thank you, Mr. Johnson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=4010)|
| 1:06:53| Next item is 11A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=4013)|
| 1:06:56| 11A is the resolution respectfully requesting that Governor Bill Lee consider the posthumous pardon of Knoxvillean Morris Franklin Mays.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=4016)|
| 1:07:07| Mayor, I'd like to move to approve, but I will need to make an amendment to the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=4027)|
| 1:07:13| Well, maybe we'll have a second on the move to approve and then come back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=4033)|
| 1:07:18| Motion made to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=4038)|
| 1:07:21| Seconded by Councilwoman Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=4041)|
| 1:07:25| Vice Mayor McKenzie, would you like to amend it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=4045)|
| 1:07:28| I would like to amend it in keeping with consistency of the work of the Cultural Exchange Center, who asked me to present this to Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=4048)|
| 1:07:38| I would like to change the word pardon to exonerate in the resolution, as well as anywhere that it's listed as pardon in the resolution that that word be changed to exonerate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=4058)|
| 1:07:55| Okay, motion made to change the resolution to use the word exonerate instead of pardon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=4075)|
| 1:08:05| Is there a second to the amendment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=4085)|
| 1:08:08| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=4088)|
| 1:08:09| Motion is seconded by Councilwoman Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=4089)|
| 1:08:12| Any discussion on the amendment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=4092)|
| 1:08:14| Ms. Ryder?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=4094)|
| 1:08:17| I would just like to ask Vice Mayor McKenzie if she would welcome us adding anyone who would like to add their name in support of this resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=4097)|
| 1:08:27| I would like to do so, if that's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=4107)|
| 1:08:30| Absolutely, I would welcome that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=4110)|
| 1:08:32| And my apologies that we got it on right before the deadline, so we did not have the opportunity to send it out to Council members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=4112)|
| 1:08:39| So I would absolutely welcome anyone who would like to sign on to sponsor this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=4119)|
| 1:08:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=4126)|
| 1:08:48| Raise your hand if you'd like to be a co-sponsor of this resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=4128)|
| 1:08:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=4133)|
| 1:08:54| It looks, I don't know if we need to do that more formally, but it looks like all Council members would like to be co-sponsors of this resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=4134)|
| 1:09:06| So if you could make the record reflect that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=4146)|
| 1:09:08| Mr. Johnson, do we need to vote on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=4148)|
| 1:09:10| Oh, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=4150)|
| 1:09:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=4151)|
| 1:09:12| Ms. Vice Mayor, let's vote on the amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=4152)|
| 1:09:15| Oh, no, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=4155)|
| 1:09:16| Yeah, let's vote on the amendment, then we can discuss the thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=4156)|
| 1:09:19| So the amendment is just to change the word from pardon to exonerate to be consistent with the Betts Cultural Exchange Center's research and language.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=4159)|
| 1:09:29| Is there any further discussion on the amendment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=4169)|
| 1:09:32| Seeing none, please conduct a roll call vote on changing that word.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=4172)|

| 1:09:50| Councilwoman Singh?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=4190)|

| 1:10:01| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=4201)|
| 1:10:03| Councilwoman Fugate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=4203)|
| 1:10:08| Okay, the amendment carries 9-0.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=4208)|
| 1:10:12| Vice Mayor McKenzie, did you want to speak to this or is Dr. Renee Kessler here to speak to this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=4212)|
| 1:10:20| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=4220)|
| 1:10:21| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=4221)|
| 1:10:23| And I would like to ask Dr. Renee Kessler, who is the Executive Director of the Betts Cultural Exchange Center, if she would speak to us just a moment, a few minutes on this resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=4223)|
| 1:10:36| I do want to take the opportunity to thank she and so many other people who have worked for years on this resolution, on this work to try to get Mr. Mays exonerated based on the lack of evidence in this particular case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=4236)|
| 1:10:55| I know that there were previous Beck directors, the late Avon Rollins, also Mr. Robert Booker, as well as former Mayor Victor Ashe, who actually has worked on this as well and sent letters to the Governor at the time to consider this action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=4255)|
| 1:11:17| So with that said, if there's anyone that I've missed, and I know that there are countless other people as well as attorneys who worked on this, I want to thank them for their diligence for this blatant injustice that happened in 1919 here in Knoxville and created a firestorm of race riots here in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=4277)|
| 1:11:37| So, Dr. Kessler, if you would not mind just to please spend a few minutes with us discussing this and the work that's been done, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=4297)|
| 1:11:45| Yes, and thank you so much to the Mayor and to you, Vice Mayor, and all of the City Council members who have agreed to sign on. I'm grateful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=4305)|
| 1:11:53| I did, Beck has been working on this, as Vice Mayor said, for many years, but I assembled a legal team about two years ago, headed by Attorney Charles Spells, who has been named and included as one of the best lawyers in America when it was first published and for many years thereafter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=4313)|
| 1:12:10| Because I really wanted to look at it from a legal perspective and not just the right thing to do. And I have a seven-page summary from him, of which I will not read, but I would like to share with you just his findings real quickly as a summary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=4330)|
| 1:12:24| And it says, Dear Reverend Kessler, you have asked me to review the trial transcripts, of which Beck has every single court proceeding of the transcripts of Maurice Mays' case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=4344)|
| 1:12:35| In the execution of Knoxville resident Maurice Mays, determined whether he was properly arrested, convicted in a legal proceeding that ignited the great race riot of 1919.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=4355)|
| 1:12:46| And he said, for the reasons that follow, I have concluded that Maurice Mays was the victim of a racially motivated, legally improper prosecution that resulted in the execution of an innocent man.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=4366)|
| 1:12:57| I won't name all of the names of the persons that also concluded, as Vice Mayor mentioned some of those, but he did conclude his statement that at a time when our nation, our state, and our community continue to struggle to achieve racial justice,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=4377)|
| 1:13:11| the prosecution and execution of Maurice Mays continues to haunt the city of Knoxville, and it should.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=4391)|
| 1:13:17| One way for the city to obtain a small measure of justice at this late date is to seek once again exoneration for Maurice Mays from the governor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=4397)|
| 1:13:26| who alone has the unfettered right to bring a measure of closure to this tragic case. Exoneration would be a matter of simple racial justice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=4406)|
| 1:13:35| And I think it's fitting, just as I close my remarks, to read something from Maurice Mays himself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=4415)|
| 1:13:40| He wrote a letter to Ms. Parsons with the care of the Center at Nittany Mills, and this was from his national state, Tennessee State Prison at the death chamber.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=4420)|
| 1:13:50| The lady who had, the only witness who said he had done this crime, and it says, Dear Ms. Parsons, I humbly beg to write you just the word and plea of your kind consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=4430)|
| 1:14:01| While I sit on the brink of the grave, burdened down, I a death cell, waiting the death signal that will send my innocent life into eternity and force me to bid goodbye to this world upon the strength of your word alone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=4441)|
| 1:14:13| I am entirely innocent of the murder of Ms. Lindsay. I truly regret her death as I would any person's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=4453)|
| 1:14:19| I was never at the house which you and Ms. Lindsay lived on or the street which it stood, and I knew nothing whatsoever about the crime until I was told about it after my arrest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=4459)|
| 1:14:29| Ms. Parsons, please, I beg to recall to your memory a mistake of just a few months ago in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=4469)|
| 1:14:35| Frank Martian, a colored man, was mistakenly accused by a young white lady who said Martian attacked her and fought her face to face for over 20 minutes in broad daylight on the railroad tracks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=4475)|
| 1:14:47| She was very much mistaken, and her heart was touched by God who looked upon her mistake, and to relieve herself, she corrected her serious mistake that might have meant death for an innocent man.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=4487)|
| 1:14:58| Ms. Parsons, please consider she made her mistake in broad daylight. You made your mistake in the nighttime when it was much easier to be mistaken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=4498)|
| 1:15:07| For God's sake, won't you please consider the mistake that calls for taking my innocent life?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=4507)|
| 1:15:12| And at the end of Maurice Mays's life, as he was at the death chamber about to await the death sentence, he prayed this final prayer, which is completely recorded in the black newspapers, of which Beck has.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=4512)|
| 1:15:24| And it says, oh, father supreme being, thou who are in above and in all things, I make my final appeal to you, not for my life, but for my soul.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=4524)|
| 1:15:33| Sheriffs, judges, and a governor have turned their backs on me, and I have only you to appeal to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=4533)|
| 1:15:39| I pray you take my soul in your strong arms and let me abide with you forevermore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=4539)|
| 1:15:43| Bless those thousands who have so nobly stood by me that we now stand in defeat, and forgive those for whom the narrowness of prejudice has placed against me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=4543)|
| 1:15:53| The flash of prejudice has whipped me into the shadows of death.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=4553)|
| 1:15:56| Cleanse the sinful hearts of men who have dipped their fingers in my innocent blood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=4556)|
| 1:16:00| Oh, God, I am innocent of the crime for which I am to die.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=4560)|
| 1:16:03| Give me strength. I want to die bravely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=4563)|
| 1:16:06| Let me go brave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=4566)|
| 1:16:08| Bless my friends and my enemies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=4568)|
| 1:16:11| I thank Mayor Kincannon and Vice Mayor Gwen McKenzie and all of the city council members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=4571)|
| 1:16:17| And I ask that you please help us requesting and supporting exoneration of Maurice Mace, who was wrongly accused, wrongly convicted, and wrongly executed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=4577)|
| 1:16:29| And the time has long since passed to repudiate the racism and prejudice that led to this unjust arrest, conviction, and execution nearly 100 years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=4589)|
| 1:16:39| His Black life still matters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=4599)|
| 1:16:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=4601)|
| 1:16:44| Thank you so much, Renee Kessler, Executive Director of the Beck Cultural Exchange Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=4604)|
| 1:16:50| Thank you, Vice Mayor McKenzie, for championing this resolution and council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=4610)|
| 1:16:55| Obviously, you've already all signed on to co-sponsor this resolution, and I thank you for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=4615)|
| 1:17:03| I first became aware of this injustice when I read Robert Booker's book, The Heat of a Red Summer, Race Mixing, Race Riding, in 1919, Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=4623)|
| 1:17:12| It's an excellent book and sort of tells the whole story of Maurice Mace's being exonerated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=4632)|
| 1:17:21| So, I joined with council in expressing my desire for a full posthumous exoneration of Mr. Mace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=4641)|
| 1:17:27| Justice may be delayed, but it does not have to be denied, and it's the right thing to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=4647)|
| 1:17:31| And I've already mentioned to Vice Mayor McKenzie and all of the city council members that this is a very important issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=4651)|
| 1:17:40| So, there's a motion on the floor, and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=4660)|
| 1:17:44| Mr. Thomas, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=4664)|

| 1:18:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=4682)|
| 1:18:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=4684)|
| 1:18:06| The motion is approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=4686)|
| 1:18:08| The second, Mr. Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=4688)|
| 1:18:10| Yes, this is a case that's interested me for many years, both as a lawyer and a citizen of Knoxville and a friend and colleague of Charles Fell's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=4690)|
| 1:18:20| almost everything that I've read about this case| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=4700)|
| 1:18:23| has thrown doubt in my mind about the process and outcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=4703)|
| 1:18:29| I also was influenced some by Mr. Booker's book| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=4709)|
| 1:18:33| that the mayor has indicated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=4713)|
| 1:18:37| Deals not only with the fate of Mr. Mays,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=4717)|
| 1:18:40| but also the atmosphere in Knoxville in 1919,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=4720)|
| 1:18:45| 101 years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=4725)|
| 1:18:46| So I think we would be amiss in not recommending| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=4726)|
| 1:18:51| that the governor take a review of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=4731)|
| 1:18:53| And I thank all my colleagues and Vice Mayor McKenzie| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=4733)|
| 1:18:59| for bringing this to our attention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=4739)|

| 1:20:25| to explain this first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=4825)|
| 1:20:26| Thank you, Ms. Testerman and Ms. Fugate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=4826)|

| 1:20:33| including council members who have taken the time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=4833)|
| 1:20:36| to understand the important issues raised in recent weeks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=4836)|
| 1:20:39| with regard to KUB.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=4839)|
| 1:20:41| We all benefit when we look with fresh eyes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=4841)|
| 1:20:43| at systems and processes that we may have in the past| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=4843)|
| 1:20:46| taken for granted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=4846)|
| 1:20:47| So thank you for all your work and attention on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=4847)|
| 1:20:51| And I know it's been a busy time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=4851)|
| 1:20:54| so I appreciate your efforts in that regard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=4854)|
| 1:20:56| I also want to take a special moment to recognize| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=4856)|
| 1:21:00| and appreciate Dr. Stephen Smith| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=4860)|
| 1:21:01| and all the coalition members who are working with SACE,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=4861)|
| 1:21:04| the Southeastern Alliance for Clean Energy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=4864)|
| 1:21:07| for raising concerns and ideas for how things might improve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=4867)|
| 1:21:11| Like many of us, I've been concerned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=4871)|
| 1:21:13| from the beginning of this conversation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=4873)|
| 1:21:15| which just started a few weeks ago at the end of June,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=4875)|
| 1:21:18| that we have not had adequate time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=4878)|
| 1:21:20| to properly consider and discuss publicly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=4880)|
| 1:21:23| potential amendments to the charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=4883)|
| 1:21:25| However, there are several ideas that are common sense| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=4885)|
| 1:21:28| and that can be advanced meaningfully| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=4888)|
| 1:21:30| through executive action,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=4890)|
| 1:21:31| both my own and in partnership| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=4891)|
| 1:21:33| with KUB executive leadership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=4893)|
| 1:21:35| I appreciate Gabe Bolas and the KUB executive team| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=4895)|
| 1:21:38| for working in good faith,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=4898)|
| 1:21:39| not only with me on strategies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=4899)|
| 1:21:41| for how I appoint KUB commissioners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=4901)|
| 1:21:44| but also for identifying meaningful commitments of their own| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=4904)|
| 1:21:47| that respond to some of the concerns raised.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=4907)|
| 1:21:50| This resolution is brought in the spirit of accountability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=4910)|
| 1:21:53| and transparency to memorialize| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=4913)|
| 1:21:56| and publicly commit in writing to the ways| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=4916)|
| 1:21:58| that I as mayor and KUB will take action| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=4918)|
| 1:22:01| in lieu of a proposed charter amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=4921)|
| 1:22:03| It also is brought in the spirit of partnership| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=4923)|
| 1:22:06| and collaboration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=4926)|
| 1:22:07| When I think about big challenges our community faces| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=4927)|
| 1:22:10| like climate change, low income energy burden,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=4930)|
| 1:22:13| and even potential opportunities like municipal broadband,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=4933)|
| 1:22:16| it's clear to me that we get farther| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=4936)|
| 1:22:18| when we work together and build trust between partners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=4938)|
| 1:22:21| This partnership towards shared goals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=4941)|
| 1:22:23| is what I think Knoxville needs most right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=4943)|
| 1:22:25| and why I hope you'll join me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=4945)|
| 1:22:26| in supporting these commitments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=4946)|
| 1:22:28| as an alternative to the proposed charter action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=4948)|
| 1:22:32| So that's my comments on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=4952)|
| 1:22:35| Is there any further, any commentary or discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=4955)|
| 1:22:38| You all have had a chance to read the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=4958)|
| 1:22:41| And we have several speakers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=4961)|
| 1:22:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=4963)|
| 1:22:45| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=4965)|
| 1:22:46| So I'll call on, hold on just a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=4966)|
| 1:22:49| We'll bring up my.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=4969)|
| 1:22:51| I believe Mr. Gabe, Gabriel Bolas would be first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=4971)|
| 1:22:55| Three, four, starting with Gabe Bolas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=4975)|
| 1:22:59| Mr. Bolas, are you on the call?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=4979)|
| 1:23:01| I am, can you hear me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=4981)|
| 1:23:03| Yes, if you could start by stating your name| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=4983)|
| 1:23:05| and address for the record, you have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=4985)|
| 1:23:08| Gabriel Bolas, president and CEO of KUB.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=4988)|
| 1:23:10| I live at 1522 Chapes Lane in Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=4990)|
| 1:23:16| I'll say I appreciate the comments by the mayor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=4996)|
| 1:23:18| and I will echo some of the things she just said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=4998)|
| 1:23:21| Over the last few weeks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=5001)|
| 1:23:22| I've had the luxury of talking to a lot of you many times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=5002)|
| 1:23:27| And I appreciate all of y'all's comments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=5007)|
| 1:23:29| questions, suggestions, ideas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=5009)|
| 1:23:32| that are important to you about KUB.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=5012)|
| 1:23:37| I think the resolution being presented by the mayor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=5017)|
| 1:23:40| addresses a lot of those in a meaningful way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=5020)|
| 1:23:42| I want to be able to talk about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=5022)|
| 1:23:46| You know, the appointment process is very important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=5026)|
| 1:23:48| It's important to our customers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=5028)|
| 1:23:50| our rate payers, our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=5030)|
| 1:23:53| And I support her endeavor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=5033)|
| 1:23:54| to make that even more deliberate going forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=5034)|
| 1:23:58| I know that fixed fees are a concern for some of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=5038)|
| 1:24:02| Our intent is to take this resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=5042)|
| 1:24:04| to our board meeting in August| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=5044)|
| 1:24:06| and codify our board's commitment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=5046)|
| 1:24:08| to freezing basic, residential basic service charges| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=5048)|
| 1:24:12| at their current levels for the next five years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=5052)|
| 1:24:16| We also will commit to doing a cost of service study| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=5056)|
| 1:24:20| if after these five years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=5060)|
| 1:24:21| if we do any future residential basic service charges,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=5061)|
| 1:24:24| we'll do a cost of service study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=5064)|
| 1:24:26| Also, we will publicly notice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=5066)|
| 1:24:29| before any of those meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=5069)|
| 1:24:31| if we are discussing any rate increases| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=5071)|
| 1:24:33| about that particular charge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=5073)|
| 1:24:35| we'll have a publicly noticed meeting ahead of that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=5075)|
| 1:24:39| before that discussion occurs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=5079)|
| 1:24:42| You also hear a lot about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=5082)|
| 1:24:43| have heard some about the Community Advisory Panel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=5083)|
| 1:24:47| I want to talk a little bit about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=5087)|
| 1:24:49| That is something that we have proposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=5089)|
| 1:24:52| It will be facilitated by Dr. Bill Lyons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=5092)|
| 1:24:55| We have had success using this similar model| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=5095)|
| 1:24:57| in other cases in our past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=5097)|
| 1:25:00| The PACE 10 Partners Council was a good example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=5100)|
| 1:25:03| We did that about 15 years ago when the EPA re-began.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=5103)|
| 1:25:07| We brought folks to our group to discuss| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=5107)|
| 1:25:10| how do we move forward?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=5110)|
| 1:25:12| What can we do to communicate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=5112)|
| 1:25:14| What can we do to make sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=5114)|
| 1:25:15| that the impact on our customers is minimized?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=5115)|
| 1:25:18| And that worked really, really well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=5118)|
| 1:25:19| In fact, it served for many, many years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=5119)|
| 1:25:22| and we learned a lot from that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=5122)|
| 1:25:25| And more recently,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=5125)|
| 1:25:26| we actually had a Tree Trim Policy Review Panel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=5126)|
| 1:25:30| that was due to some concerns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=5130)|
| 1:25:31| about our tree trimming practices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=5131)|
| 1:25:33| And we brought folks into that meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=5133)|
| 1:25:35| and have conversations about ways we can improve that also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=5135)|
| 1:25:40| And that's become a very popular,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=5140)|
| 1:25:41| I mean, we've learned a lot from that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=5141)|
| 1:25:43| It's been very successful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=5143)|
| 1:25:44| So those are examples of things like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=5144)|
| 1:25:46| So this new Community Advisory Panel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=5146)|
| 1:25:49| would include folks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=5149)|
| 1:25:50| would include a person from SACE,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=5150)|
| 1:25:52| a person from Sierra Club,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=5152)|
| 1:25:54| a low-income representative,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=5154)|
| 1:25:56| a minority business representative,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=5156)|
| 1:25:58| neighborhood representative,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=5158)|
| 1:25:59| folks like that would be on this committee on this panel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=5159)|
| 1:26:02| because that's the folks we wanna intertwine with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=5162)|
| 1:26:06| talk to, have a conversation about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=5166)|
| 1:26:08| listen, and become a better utility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=5168)|
| 1:26:10| for all of our customers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=5170)|
| 1:26:12| I will say, once again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=5172)|
| 1:26:13| I appreciate the mayor's leadership in this resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=5173)|
| 1:26:17| I believe this is a very collaborative approach| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=5177)|
| 1:26:19| to address issues that are important to everyone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=5179)|
| 1:26:22| that we serve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=5182)|
| 1:26:23| I believe this is a much more positive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=5183)|
| 1:26:25| and productive way to make progress| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=5185)|
| 1:26:28| in trying to amend a charter in short order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=5188)|
| 1:26:30| I encourage every one of you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=5190)|
| 1:26:32| to vote in favor of this resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=5192)|
| 1:26:33| and I'm glad to answer any questions you may have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=5193)|
| 1:26:40| Thank you, Mr. Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=5200)|
| 1:26:41| The next person signed up to speak for this resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=5201)|
| 1:26:45| is Tyvee Small.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=5205)|
| 1:26:46| Mr. Small, are you on the call?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=5206)|
| 1:26:52| Can you all hear me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=5212)|
| 1:26:53| Yep, we can hear you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=5213)|
| 1:26:55| If you could start by stating your name| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=5215)|
| 1:26:57| and address for the record,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=5217)|
| 1:26:58| and you have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=5218)|
| 1:27:00| I'm Tyvee Small.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=5220)|
| 1:27:02| I live at 1856 Tillery Square Lane,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=5222)|
| 1:27:05| and I am a board member of KUB.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=5225)|
| 1:27:07| I've been a member of that board since January of 2017| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=5227)|
| 1:27:11| and have served on the nominating committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=5231)|
| 1:27:12| for the last three years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=5232)|
| 1:27:14| And one of the things I wanna talk about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=5234)|
| 1:27:15| is the diversity of our board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=5235)|
| 1:27:17| I am proud of that board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=5237)|
| 1:27:19| that our nominating process has created.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=5239)|
| 1:27:21| When you think about boards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=5241)|
| 1:27:22| sometimes across industries,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=5242)|
| 1:27:25| they participate in tokenism,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=5245)|
| 1:27:27| but I do think that we are intentional| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=5247)|
| 1:27:29| about the people that we select for our board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=5249)|
| 1:27:32| So if you think about it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=5252)|
| 1:27:34| two of our seven members are African-American,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=5254)|
| 1:27:36| four of our seven members are women,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=5256)|
| 1:27:39| and all of us have different viewpoints.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=5259)|
| 1:27:41| And we bring those perspectives| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=5261)|
| 1:27:43| to every decision that we make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=5263)|
| 1:27:45| The nominating process is designed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=5265)|
| 1:27:47| to be really reflective of our community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=5267)|
| 1:27:50| and to address the unique needs of the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=5270)|
| 1:27:52| And so we conduct an open process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=5272)|
| 1:27:54| where anyone is allowed to apply.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=5274)|
| 1:27:57| And we want to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=5277)|
| 1:27:58| our work really is to provide the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=5278)|
| 1:28:00| a strong set of candidates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=5280)|
| 1:28:02| And so the mayor and council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=5282)|
| 1:28:03| also have an important role in that process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=5283)|
| 1:28:06| And we support the actions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=5286)|
| 1:28:07| that the mayor is committing to in this resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=5287)|
| 1:28:11| When you think about term limits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=5291)|
| 1:28:14| the mayor's approach to limiting commissioners to one term| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=5294)|
| 1:28:17| can address the issue of term limits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=5297)|
| 1:28:19| without changing the charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=5299)|
| 1:28:21| And if you think about it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=5301)|
| 1:28:22| over the last 25 commissioners that have been appointed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=5302)|
| 1:28:25| only about six of those were appointed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=5305)|
| 1:28:27| to two full seven-year terms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=5307)|
| 1:28:30| And so the mayor already has that ability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=5310)|
| 1:28:33| to think about term limits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=5313)|
| 1:28:34| and we support her process in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=5314)|
| 1:28:37| One of the things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=5317)|
| 1:28:38| if you've ever listened to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=5318)|
| 1:28:40| or been to one of our KUB board meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=5320)|
| 1:28:43| one of the first questions we all ask| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=5323)|
| 1:28:45| is how will our decisions affect our low-income customers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=5325)|
| 1:28:49| If you know any of the work that we've done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=5329)|
| 1:28:51| that is absolutely critical| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=5331)|
| 1:28:53| to the work that we do as a board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=5333)|
| 1:28:55| is to make sure that everybody,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=5335)|
| 1:28:57| that we represent everybody in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=5337)|
| 1:29:00| So if you think about some of the things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=5340)|
| 1:29:01| that we've done proactively,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=5341)|
| 1:29:03| our customer counselors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=5343)|
| 1:29:04| who really connect our low-income customers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=5344)|
| 1:29:07| to social services if they need help,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=5347)|
| 1:29:09| the work that we've done around Project HELP,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=5349)|
| 1:29:11| around Round It Up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=5351)|
| 1:29:14| the support that we've had for weatherization| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=5354)|
| 1:29:16| and water efficiency programs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=5356)|
| 1:29:18| and then suspending disconnections for non-payment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=5358)|
| 1:29:21| and then waiving late fees and transaction fees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=5361)|
| 1:29:25| for the issues that surround COVID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=5365)|
| 1:29:28| And then finally,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=5368)|
| 1:29:29| the commitment to eliminate all of the work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=5369)|
| 1:29:32| to eliminate all of the deferred or planned rate increases| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=5372)|
| 1:29:35| in all of our systems,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=5375)|
| 1:29:36| because we do have four systems| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=5376)|
| 1:29:38| that have impacted our customers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=5378)|
| 1:29:40| and we were already,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=5380)|
| 1:29:41| our customers were already in crisis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=5381)|
| 1:29:43| The other thing I wanna mention| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=5383)|
| 1:29:45| is that we are also looking at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=5385)|
| 1:29:47| how we operate as an organization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=5387)|
| 1:29:49| As you look at systemic institutional| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=5389)|
| 1:29:51| and systematic issues of inequity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=5391)|
| 1:29:53| that is really key to who we are and what we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=5393)|
| 1:29:56| And so not only are we looking at that externally,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=5396)|
| 1:30:00| but we're also looking at that internally| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=5400)|
| 1:30:02| as an organization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=5402)|
| 1:30:04| And then finally,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=5404)|
| 1:30:05| I'll say that we understand the obligation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=5405)|
| 1:30:06| that we have to serve all of our customers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=5406)|
| 1:30:09| and address all of their unique needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=5409)|
| 1:30:10| And this resolution really does demonstrate that commitment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=5410)|
| 1:30:14| and it builds on it by adding the advisory panel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=5414)|
| 1:30:17| that we can seek more input intentionally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=5417)|
| 1:30:20| I think intentionality is important| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=5420)|
| 1:30:22| and the work that we do in terms of making sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=5422)|
| 1:30:24| that we represent every single member of our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=5424)|
| 1:30:28| Our board is committed to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=5428)|
| 1:30:29| We have been committed to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=5429)|
| 1:30:32| As any organization have more work to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=5432)|
| 1:30:34| but every day that we're working as a board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=5434)|
| 1:30:37| to make sure that we represent the needs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=5437)|
| 1:30:40| of everybody in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=5440)|
| 1:30:42| And so I urge you to support the mayor's resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=5442)|
| 1:30:46| and we look forward to working with the mayor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=5446)|
| 1:30:49| and the city council to implement that resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=5449)|
| 1:30:51| And I really do encourage you to support that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=5451)|
| 1:30:55| because we as an organization have been working| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=5455)|
| 1:30:58| to address many of those things that you talked about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=5458)|
| 1:31:01| And I think you can get it done with your partnership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=5461)|
| 1:31:03| So thank you for allowing me this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=5463)|
| 1:31:06| Thank you, Mr. Small.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=5466)|
| 1:31:09| The next person signed up to speak for the resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=5469)|
| 1:31:12| is Adrienne Simpson Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=5472)|
| 1:31:14| Ms. Simpson Brown, are you on the call?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=5474)|
| 1:31:25| Here, can you hear me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=5485)|
| 1:31:26| Yes, yes we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=5486)|
| 1:31:27| If you could start by stating your name and address| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=5487)|
| 1:31:30| for the record and you'll have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=5490)|
| 1:31:33| Okay, my name is Adrienne Simpson Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=5493)|
| 1:31:36| My address is 6017 Montrachet Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=5496)|
| 1:31:41| So I want to just kind of echo what Commissioner Small| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=5501)|
| 1:31:47| just spoke of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=5507)|
| 1:31:49| We're very committed to our community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=5509)|
| 1:31:52| but I wanted to say that I've served on the KUB board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=5512)|
| 1:31:56| since January, 2018, and I'm currently the vice chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=5516)|
| 1:32:01| I have appreciated the chance to speak directly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=5521)|
| 1:32:03| with several of you over the past few weeks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=5523)|
| 1:32:06| regarding my experience in the KUB board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=5526)|
| 1:32:08| And I'm glad to speak to you today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=5528)|
| 1:32:10| in support of this resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=5530)|
| 1:32:12| I believe this proposal is a positive step forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=5532)|
| 1:32:18| for the city and for KUB.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=5538)|
| 1:32:21| It builds on the cooperative relationship| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=5541)|
| 1:32:23| that already exists between our organizations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=5543)|
| 1:32:27| It provides a way for us to gather more direct feedback| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=5547)|
| 1:32:30| from our customers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=5550)|
| 1:32:32| It also is responsive to the feedback we've received| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=5552)|
| 1:32:35| from you during the discussions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=5555)|
| 1:32:37| about the proposed charter amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=5557)|
| 1:32:41| I wasn't on the board when KUB established| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=5561)|
| 1:32:43| the Partners Council or the Tree Trim Panel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=5563)|
| 1:32:46| but I have heard about how successful those efforts were.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=5566)|
| 1:32:50| The Community Advisory Panel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=5570)|
| 1:32:52| will be a great investment in our community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=5572)|
| 1:32:54| and we are committed to doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=5574)|
| 1:32:57| You may have heard some unflattering things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=5577)|
| 1:33:00| about KUB board and its impact on the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=5580)|
| 1:33:04| As a member of that board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=5584)|
| 1:33:06| I want you to know that we are all committed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=5586)|
| 1:33:08| to those we serve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=5588)|
| 1:33:12| Also, we can't make everyone happy all of the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=5592)|
| 1:33:16| That is what has led to the charter amendment proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=5596)|
| 1:33:19| And we know that every organization can always improve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=5599)|
| 1:33:23| I hope that you can see from the commitments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=5603)|
| 1:33:26| we're proposing here tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=5606)|
| 1:33:28| that we take this obligation very seriously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=5608)|
| 1:33:33| For those reasons and for all the reasons| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=5613)|
| 1:33:35| that have been spoken of by Mr. Bolas and Mr. Smalls,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=5615)|
| 1:33:41| I encourage you to vote in favor of this resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=5621)|
| 1:33:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=5625)|
| 1:33:47| Thank you, Ms. Simpson-Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=5627)|
| 1:33:51| There's one other person signed up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=5631)|
| 1:33:53| to speak for the resolution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=5633)|
| 1:33:55| but since we're keeping it to three per-year rules,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=5635)|
| 1:33:59| that would be Doug Viem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=5639)|
| 1:34:01| I'm not gonna recognize him per-year rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=5641)|
| 1:34:03| The first person signed up to speak| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=5643)|
| 1:34:05| against this resolution is Kent Minault.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=5645)|
| 1:34:10| Mr. Minault, Minault, sorry, maybe it's Minault.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=5650)|
| 1:34:14| Are you on the line?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=5654)|
| 1:34:18| I think so, can you hear me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=5658)|
| 1:34:19| Yes, we can hear you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=5659)|
| 1:34:20| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=5660)|
| 1:34:21| By stating your name and address for the record| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=5661)|
| 1:34:23| and you have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=5663)|
| 1:34:26| All right, thank you, council members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=5666)|
| 1:34:28| Yeah, I'm Kent Minault and I live at 311 West Glenwood Avenue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=5668)|
| 1:34:34| and I'm with the Sierra Club.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=5674)|
| 1:34:37| And tonight I'm asking for an amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=5677)|
| 1:34:41| Oh, hang on, I've got to get my, excuse me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=5681)|
| 1:34:45| the screen just changed here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=5685)|
| 1:34:46| There we go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=5686)|
| 1:34:48| Tonight I'm asking for an amendment to resolution B.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=5688)|
| 1:34:52| That's the mayor's counter proposal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=5692)|
| 1:34:54| to the charter amendment also being considered tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=5694)|
| 1:34:57| But please know, I favor the intent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=5697)|
| 1:35:01| of the mayor's resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=5701)|
| 1:35:03| in that it supports the suggested changes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=5703)|
| 1:35:06| in the way KUB does business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=5706)|
| 1:35:08| namely bringing KUB board selection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=5708)|
| 1:35:10| under closer public scrutiny,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=5710)|
| 1:35:13| extending the freeze on fixed fees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=5713)|
| 1:35:15| and providing for a cost of service study| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=5715)|
| 1:35:18| before any further increases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=5718)|
| 1:35:20| And by the way, all these measures are agreed on by KUB| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=5720)|
| 1:35:24| as I think you've just heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=5724)|
| 1:35:26| And I want to express at this point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=5726)|
| 1:35:27| my appreciation for the consistently kind reception| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=5727)|
| 1:35:32| I and other environmental advocates have gotten| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=5732)|
| 1:35:35| when we speak before KUB| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=5735)|
| 1:35:37| and the generous commitment of time they've given to us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=5737)|
| 1:35:41| when I brought in coalition partners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=5741)|
| 1:35:44| like Interfaith Power and Light and SEED| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=5744)|
| 1:35:47| and Community Voices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=5747)|
| 1:35:49| My quibble here is with the nullification provision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=5749)|
| 1:35:53| in the mayor's resolution that would cause it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=5753)|
| 1:35:56| to self-nullify if the subsequent charter amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=5756)|
| 1:36:01| is placed on the November ballot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=5761)|
| 1:36:03| Now, this is a nasty piece of procedural fancy footwork| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=5763)|
| 1:36:07| that seeks to bias the council on a subsequent vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=5767)|
| 1:36:11| Now, we who elect you all want you to approach both votes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=5771)|
| 1:36:17| with your consciences unencumbered by any threat| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=5777)|
| 1:36:20| to overturn your previous action| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=5780)|
| 1:36:22| in both the resolution and the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=5782)|
| 1:36:26| If you like it, vote for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=5786)|
| 1:36:28| If you don't, don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=5788)|
| 1:36:30| The nullification clause is a manipulation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=5790)|
| 1:36:34| Get rid of it, look at both measures straight on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=5794)|
| 1:36:37| and vote on the basis of your merits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=5797)|
| 1:36:41| I'm Kent Minow, I volunteer with the Sierra Club.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=5801)|
| 1:36:43| Thanks for your kind attention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=5803)|
| 1:36:49| Thank you, Mr. Minow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=5809)|
| 1:36:51| The next person signed up to speak against| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=5811)|
| 1:36:54| is Calvin Skinner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=5814)|
| 1:37:00| Mr. Skinner, are you on the call?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=5820)|
| 1:37:03| Hello, good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=5823)|
| 1:37:04| This is Calvin Taylor Skinner, 2714 Brooks Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=5824)|
| 1:37:12| And thank you for hearing us as we express our concerns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=5832)|
| 1:37:18| as I am Reverend Calvin Skinner, faith leader| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=5838)|
| 1:37:23| and community organizer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=5843)|
| 1:37:24| I am here to amplify the voices of those who express,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=5844)|
| 1:37:30| especially their contention as it relates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=5850)|
| 1:37:34| to nullifying this resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=5854)|
| 1:37:40| if the city council passes a ballot initiative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=5860)|
| 1:37:46| As I will echo what has already been shared,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=5866)|
| 1:37:53| I agree with many of the initiatives| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=5873)|
| 1:37:57| that are presented in the resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=5877)|
| 1:38:02| But nevertheless, that caveat is really where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=5882)|
| 1:38:09| I must stand and speak to this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=5889)|
| 1:38:14| for it is our obligation to hear from the people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=5894)|
| 1:38:20| and the best way to do so is through the vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=5900)|
| 1:38:26| And this ballot initiative will certainly empower| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=5906)|
| 1:38:31| those people who have felt voiceless| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=5911)|
| 1:38:35| to express themselves in this way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=5915)|
| 1:38:38| I also wanna share a story that is a traditional story.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=5918)|
| 1:38:44| My uncle who was a national sports player| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=5924)|
| 1:38:49| and a spiritual leader, Reverend Thomas Skinner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=5929)|
| 1:38:53| who was actually a spiritual advisor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=5933)|
| 1:38:55| to the Congressional Black Caucus,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=5935)|
| 1:38:59| which also included the legendary Congressman John Lewis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=5939)|
| 1:39:05| He spoke about, my uncle that is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=5945)|
| 1:39:09| about a young daughter who built the courage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=5949)|
| 1:39:12| to ask her mother why did she cut the turkey in half| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=5952)|
| 1:39:18| every time she cooked the turkey?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=5958)|
| 1:39:21| And her response was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=5961)|
| 1:39:22| I don't know that it's something my mother did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=5962)|
| 1:39:27| So you need to ask my mother, your grandmother.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=5967)|
| 1:39:30| So she goes and asks her grandmother, the daughter that is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=5970)|
| 1:39:35| and her mother expressed the reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=5975)|
| 1:39:39| She said the reason why she cooked the turkey in halves| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=5979)|
| 1:39:45| was because their oven was too small growing up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=5985)|
| 1:39:56| and she had to cut the turkey in half in order to cook it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=5996)|
| 1:40:00| And so that story just reinforces| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=6000)|
| 1:40:03| how often we do certain things over and over again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=6003)|
| 1:40:08| not knowing why, but finally, when we get to the source,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=6008)|
| 1:40:12| we understand there was at one point a time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=6012)|
| 1:40:16| that it was necessary, but it's no longer necessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=6016)|
| 1:40:20| Here is a time for us to really critically analyze| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=6020)|
| 1:40:25| what we have been doing over and over again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=6025)|
| 1:40:28| and recognize that at one point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=6028)|
| 1:40:32| it might have been necessary to do it in one way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=6032)|
| 1:40:35| but now we can grow, we can learn,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=6035)|
| 1:40:39| and we can really expand how we, excuse me, how we do things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=6039)|
| 1:40:46| And with this ballot initiative,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=6046)|
| 1:40:50| I think we can couple it with the resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=6050)|
| 1:40:55| to show the city, to show our citizens,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=6055)|
| 1:40:59| we are ready to do things in new ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=6059)|
| 1:41:02| We are ready to expand who is at the table,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=6062)|
| 1:41:07| just not in the advisory role,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=6067)|
| 1:41:10| but also in decision-making roles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=6070)|
| 1:41:12| And the ballot resolution reinforces| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=6072)|
| 1:41:16| the city is ready to empower our citizens,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=6076)|
| 1:41:21| especially those who have felt left out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=6081)|
| 1:41:25| to be able to be empowered to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=6085)|
| 1:41:29| A little less than a minute to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=6089)|
| 1:41:31| Okay, no worries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=6091)|
| 1:41:32| And as I close here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=6092)|
| 1:41:34| please remember that we are here to expand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=6094)|
| 1:41:39| who is at the table,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=6099)|
| 1:41:41| and certainly Doug Vim,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=6101)|
| 1:41:46| who is supposed to speak or in line to speak,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=6106)|
| 1:41:51| I would certainly hope that he will have the floor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=6111)|
| 1:41:54| to speak after me or at some point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=6114)|
| 1:41:58| Thank you all for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=6118)|
| 1:42:00| God bless you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=6120)|
| 1:42:01| Thank you, Reverend Skinner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=6121)|
| 1:42:06| Let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=6126)|
| 1:42:09| That concludes the people who've signed up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=6129)|
| 1:42:11| to speak on this item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=6131)|
| 1:42:14| So there's, I'll leave it to the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=6134)|
| 1:42:19| I'll let council members, I'm sure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=6139)|
| 1:42:20| have some questions or comments to make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=6140)|
| 1:42:27| Does anyone, Vice Mayor McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=6147)|
| 1:42:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=6150)|
| 1:42:31| Okay, thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=6151)|
| 1:42:32| A couple of questions on the resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=6152)|
| 1:42:36| So what is being proposed would be a collaborative effort| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=6156)|
| 1:42:41| between the city, the mayor's office and administration,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=6161)|
| 1:42:45| and KUB's administration and the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=6165)|
| 1:42:51| Would there be a memorandum of understanding that's written?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=6171)|
| 1:42:55| And how will we, as a council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=6175)|
| 1:42:58| have a, I guess, commitment that any changes that are made| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=6178)|
| 1:43:04| that this resolution would proceed and stay active?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=6184)|
| 1:43:12| Thank you, Vice Mayor McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=6192)|
| 1:43:14| This resolution, I can't remember which,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=6194)|
| 1:43:17| where it says in here that we would have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=6197)|
| 1:43:19| there's a timeframe in here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=6199)|
| 1:43:21| and I would be, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=6201)|
| 1:43:23| expect to report back to you on the progress we make,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=6203)|
| 1:43:26| you know, by the end of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=6206)|
| 1:43:27| I think it says this calendar year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=6207)|
| 1:43:29| Erin Gill, is that where, I can't,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=6209)|
| 1:43:33| it says at the end of this calendar year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=6213)|
| 1:43:34| Go ahead, Ms. Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=6214)|
| 1:43:35| Yeah, so, hello, council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=6215)|
| 1:43:38| Section three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=6218)|
| 1:43:40| Yes, that is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=6220)|
| 1:43:41| So there are kind of two components of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=6221)|
| 1:43:45| That component are executive action commitments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=6225)|
| 1:43:49| by Mayor McKinnon,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=6229)|
| 1:43:50| and specifically with regard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=6230)|
| 1:43:52| to changing the application process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=6232)|
| 1:43:55| and working with KUB to ensure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=6235)|
| 1:43:57| that Mayor McKinnon receives all applications| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=6237)|
| 1:44:00| that have been completed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=6240)|
| 1:44:02| in addition to the nominations from KUB.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=6242)|
| 1:44:05| Those are action items that we would like to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=6245)|
| 1:44:08| at your blessing, want to report back to you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=6248)|
| 1:44:13| just so that you can confirm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=6253)|
| 1:44:14| that those commitments have been fulfilled,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=6254)|
| 1:44:16| and that, for example,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=6256)|
| 1:44:17| the application has been updated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=6257)|
| 1:44:19| to reflect what we've suggested here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=6259)|
| 1:44:22| Similarly, I would argue that as council oversees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=6262)|
| 1:44:26| and has to approve the board nominations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=6266)|
| 1:44:29| that should Mayor McKinnon move forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=6269)|
| 1:44:31| with trying to appoint a member to a second term,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=6271)|
| 1:44:34| that you would be in a position| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=6274)|
| 1:44:35| to hold the administration accountable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=6275)|
| 1:44:39| for the commitment to the one term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=6279)|
| 1:44:41| The second component is in regard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=6281)|
| 1:44:43| to KUB executive leadership,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=6283)|
| 1:44:46| and I will defer to Mr. Bulleth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=6286)|
| 1:44:49| on some of the specifics,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=6289)|
| 1:44:50| but in terms of the community advisory panel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=6290)|
| 1:44:55| that's, again, an action item| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=6295)|
| 1:44:56| that can be reported out to you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=6296)|
| 1:44:59| and provided an update| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=6299)|
| 1:45:01| that those items have taken place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=6301)|
| 1:45:03| and that community board is in the works,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=6303)|
| 1:45:06| you know, and underway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=6306)|
| 1:45:07| and I'll let him speak to kind of their timeline for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=6307)|
| 1:45:10| I would also offer that KUB, I believe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=6310)|
| 1:45:12| is prepared to actually share with council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=6312)|
| 1:45:15| at the workshop on Thursday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=6315)|
| 1:45:16| should that proceed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=6316)|
| 1:45:18| the specific resolution language| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=6318)|
| 1:45:20| that they intend to bring to their board in August| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=6320)|
| 1:45:23| that would memorialize the commitments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=6323)|
| 1:45:25| around fixed fees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=6325)|
| 1:45:28| as well as the cost of service study commitment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=6328)|
| 1:45:30| for any future rate increases| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=6330)|
| 1:45:32| that might be considered after that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=6332)|
| 1:45:36| KUB speak to those things more specifically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=6336)|
| 1:45:41| And I would just add, Vice Mayor McKenzie| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=6341)|
| 1:45:43| and members of council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=6343)|
| 1:45:45| I'm really truly grateful| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=6345)|
| 1:45:47| that various advocates have brought this to our attention,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=6347)|
| 1:45:51| and I just feel like this resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=6351)|
| 1:45:54| accomplishes those goals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=6354)|
| 1:45:55| particularly on making meetings and whatnot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=6355)|
| 1:46:00| you know, more accountable, more transparent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=6360)|
| 1:46:02| and, you know, focused on equity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=6362)|
| 1:46:05| It just gets it done faster| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=6365)|
| 1:46:06| in a more collaborative manner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=6366)|
| 1:46:08| So I think it's a big win| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=6368)|
| 1:46:10| for the people who brought this to our attention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=6370)|
| 1:46:14| This was all, of course, on our minds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=6374)|
| 1:46:16| and part of something I discussed on the campaign trail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=6376)|
| 1:46:21| And it was, so I think that this is the best way forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=6381)|
| 1:46:25| And I, you know, just am really grateful| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=6385)|
| 1:46:29| for the people who've been working on this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=6389)|
| 1:46:31| and think it's a win for their advocacy efforts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=6391)|
| 1:46:34| as well as recognizing that we get farther| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=6394)|
| 1:46:37| when we work in collaboration with KUB| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=6397)|
| 1:46:40| and other partners than in ways| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=6400)|
| 1:46:44| that are less collaborative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=6404)|
| 1:46:45| So I'm looking forward to working on these things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=6405)|
| 1:46:49| I'm committed to it right here publicly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=6409)|
| 1:46:51| in front of all of you, in front of the public,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=6411)|
| 1:46:54| and ask that you, if you approve this this evening,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=6414)|

| 1:47:14| that there was somebody left off the list| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=6434)|
| 1:47:16| to speak against this item, Mr. John Butler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=6436)|

| 1:47:23| but he didn't get on the list, so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=6443)|
| 1:47:26| Okay, is he on the call now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=6446)|

| 1:47:32| of your conversation to hear from Mr. Butler?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=6452)|

| 1:49:31| to ensure that the public input is heard loud and clear,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=6571)|

| 1:51:30| that the mayor's proposed executive action| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=6690)|
| 1:51:32| have more robust language| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=6692)|

| 1:51:38| providing representation on the KUB board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=6698)|
| 1:51:41| from the impoverished community of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=6701)|
| 1:51:44| Moreover, the Knoxville NACP branch| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=6704)|
| 1:51:48| desires to have a ballot initiative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=6708)|
| 1:51:50| to ensure that the public input is heard loud and clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=6710)|
| 1:51:54| And once again, in keeping with the NACP's mission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=6714)|
| 1:51:58| of removing all barriers through the democratic process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=6718)|
| 1:52:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=6722)|

| 1:52:08| I believe that concludes, that's three, four, three against.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=6728)|
| 1:52:11| So that's all that we have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=6731)|
| 1:52:14| I think also signed up for the against.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=6734)|
| 1:52:17| So, Council Member Testerman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=6737)|
| 1:52:20| I have comments, I've had my hand up for about 30 minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=6740)|
| 1:52:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=6745)|
| 1:52:26| Go ahead, sorry, I didn't see it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=6746)|
| 1:52:30| I wanted to comment on something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=6750)|
| 1:52:32| that Reverend Butler mentioned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=6752)|
| 1:52:35| and it was also mentioned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=6755)|
| 1:52:40| when KUB member Tavi Small spoke,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=6760)|
| 1:52:45| board member.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=6765)|
| 1:52:48| I was surprised to see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=6768)|
| 1:52:52| that there was a recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=6772)|
| 1:52:55| that a community advisory board be formed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=6775)|
| 1:53:00| and that on that board is where we would give,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=6780)|
| 1:53:06| a low-income community member a seat at the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=6786)|
| 1:53:10| Not a voting seat, but they can be on an advisory board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=6790)|
| 1:53:15| That really disturbed me, I have to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=6795)|
| 1:53:21| because through these discussions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=6801)|
| 1:53:23| of what this ordinance should look like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=6803)|
| 1:53:25| and what ballot initiative should be sent forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=6805)|
| 1:53:30| I was open to the discussion that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=6810)|
| 1:53:33| maybe it would take some time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=6813)|
| 1:53:37| to define what a low-income board member,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=6817)|
| 1:53:43| get a definition of a low-income board member| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=6823)|
| 1:53:45| that we all could be in agreement with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=6825)|
| 1:53:50| But then there were also discussions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=6830)|
| 1:53:53| of the fact that even trying to recruit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=6833)|
| 1:53:58| these perspectives to the board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=6838)|
| 1:54:03| would start to be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=6843)|
| 1:54:04| would start walking the line| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=6844)|
| 1:54:09| of playing politics with the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=6849)|
| 1:54:12| I have struggled with those comments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=6852)|
| 1:54:16| because I'm certainly hoping| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=6856)|
| 1:54:19| that we can find a resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=6859)|
| 1:54:21| that all parties are in agreement with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=6861)|
| 1:54:25| I know that there's a lot of support out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=6865)|
| 1:54:27| in the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=6867)|
| 1:54:28| We've seen it coming through our emails| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=6868)|
| 1:54:30| and through our phones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=6870)|
| 1:54:32| And for those of us who ran for office last year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=6872)|
| 1:54:34| we saw it very much on the campaign trail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=6874)|
| 1:54:38| So I don't think that these are new conversations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=6878)|
| 1:54:41| for many people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=6881)|
| 1:54:43| And on the issue of limiting board terms,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=6883)|
| 1:54:50| from my experience, there's general agreement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=6890)|
| 1:54:52| around that, not only for KUB,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=6892)|
| 1:54:56| but throughout our boards and committees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=6896)|
| 1:54:59| And I think that is a priority for many.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=6899)|
| 1:55:03| So I wanted to state my just disappointment, honestly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=6903)|
| 1:55:11| with where the conversation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=6911)|
| 1:55:13| around the low-income board member has gone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=6913)|
| 1:55:19| And I'm a little hesitant to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=6919)|
| 1:55:25| to even recommend where we should go from here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=6925)|
| 1:55:27| because I'm honestly worried| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=6927)|
| 1:55:31| that we would compromise too much| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=6931)|
| 1:55:37| and not represent what the community is calling| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=6937)|
| 1:55:41| for the opportunity to vote on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=6941)|
| 1:55:46| I did have one question for Gabe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=6946)|
| 1:55:48| or anyone who can answer it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=6948)|
| 1:55:49| When there is a commitment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=6949)|
| 1:55:52| to extending the freeze on fixed fees for five years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=6952)|
| 1:55:57| does that time period begin in 2021,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=6957)|
| 1:56:01| freezing the fees until 2026?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=6961)|
| 1:56:04| Or would that begin at the signing of this agreement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=6964)|
| 1:56:08| Mr. Bowles?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=6968)|
| 1:56:09| Yeah, can you hear me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=6969)|
| 1:56:11| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=6971)|
| 1:56:12| Yeah, so what we did plan is to actually go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=6972)|
| 1:56:14| to the board next month with this language resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=6974)|
| 1:56:18| to freeze the fees the next five years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=6978)|
| 1:56:21| beginning this next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=6981)|
| 1:56:22| So 2021 on, the next five years beyond| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=6982)|
| 1:56:27| this current year we're in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=6987)|
| 1:56:28| because we've already frozen this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=6988)|
| 1:56:31| And so we'll be freezing the next five years beyond that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=6991)|
| 1:56:34| Okay, perfect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=6994)|
| 1:56:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=6994)|
| 1:56:37| Yeah, those were some issues that I wanted to lift up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=6997)|
| 1:56:41| I have some other thoughts that I just asked the KUB board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=7001)|
| 1:56:46| If the question that you ask at the beginning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=7006)|
| 1:56:49| of each meeting is how will this impact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=7009)|
| 1:56:51| low income community members?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=7011)|
| 1:56:54| How can you answer that question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=7014)|
| 1:56:56| if you do not have folks who have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=7016)|
| 1:57:01| you're currently or previously lived a low income life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=7021)|
| 1:57:07| Otherwise we are being quite paternalistic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=7027)|
| 1:57:11| in our leadership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=7031)|
| 1:57:13| If we need those perspectives at the table,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=7033)|
| 1:57:15| we should recruit those perspectives to the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=7035)|
| 1:57:18| Not try to guess what they're thinking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=7038)|
| 1:57:21| and certainly not create an advisory board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=7041)|
| 1:57:23| that doesn't give that perspective voting power.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=7043)|
| 1:57:33| Thank you, Ms. Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=7053)|
| 1:57:34| I mean, did you have a further specific question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=7054)|
| 1:57:38| or did you wanna just leave those comments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=7058)|
| 1:57:42| and have the rest of the conversation going?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=7062)|
| 1:57:44| I just couldn't tell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=7064)|
| 1:57:46| Well, those are the rest of my comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=7066)|
| 1:57:49| I mean, if there are no others,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=7069)|
| 1:57:50| I would like to make an emotion to amend the resolution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=7070)|
| 1:57:56| responding to the comments and removing the clause| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=7076)|
| 1:58:01| that would null and void this resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=7081)|
| 1:58:05| should we take further action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=7085)|
| 1:58:11| Okay, there's a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=7091)|
| 1:58:13| I guess I would speak to your comments, Ms. Parker,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=7093)|
| 1:58:16| that I'm very committed to continuing to appoint| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=7096)|
| 1:58:21| a diverse group of people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=7101)|
| 1:58:22| to the KUB Board of Commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=7102)|
| 1:58:24| As you heard, we have people who are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=7104)|
| 1:58:29| we have black members, we have women,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=7109)|
| 1:58:32| we have people from diverse backgrounds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=7112)|
| 1:58:35| And I'm committed to continuing that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=7115)|
| 1:58:39| and also to making sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=7119)|
| 1:58:40| that the low income perspective is represented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=7120)|
| 1:58:43| I know that current commissioners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=7123)|
| 1:58:44| some of them have come from backgrounds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=7124)|
| 1:58:47| where they were low income.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=7127)|
| 1:58:48| They may not be low income in the current day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=7128)|
| 1:58:51| but that doesn't mean they've forgotten| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=7131)|
| 1:58:52| what they experienced in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=7132)|
| 1:58:54| So I just wanted to speak to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=7134)|
| 1:58:57| So I also, well, I can wait and see if there's a second,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=7137)|
| 1:59:02| but that clause was put in there on purpose| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=7142)|
| 1:59:07| because we wanna have a collaborative relationship| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=7147)|
| 1:59:11| with KUB and our advocacy groups.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=7151)|
| 1:59:13| We think that this can be effective moving forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=7153)|
| 1:59:17| without having to go to a charter thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=7157)|
| 1:59:19| A charter change is like changing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=7159)|
| 1:59:21| the constitution of our city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=7161)|
| 1:59:23| It's a really big deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=7163)|
| 1:59:24| We all just started hearing about this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=7164)|
| 1:59:27| like three or four weeks ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=7167)|
| 1:59:29| this particular charter amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=7169)|
| 1:59:31| When we talk about transparency and collaboration,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=7171)|
| 1:59:33| I mean, I heard about it after it was already| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=7173)|
| 1:59:37| a very finalized, polished document, not before that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=7177)|
| 1:59:42| And I don't think KUB was involved in prior conversations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=7182)|
| 1:59:46| and some council members were, some weren't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=7186)|
| 1:59:50| I just think four weeks is not an ample amount of time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=7190)|
| 1:59:54| to consider changing our equivalent of our constitution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=7194)|
| 1:59:57| So I instead think that moving forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=7197)|
| 2:00:00| with this resolution will accomplish these same goals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=7200)|
| 2:00:04| and do it more collaboratively| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=7204)|
| 2:00:08| and with a greater accountability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=7208)|
| 2:00:11| And I'm asking you to hold me accountable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=7211)|
| 2:00:13| And if we think that certain things still need study| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=7213)|
| 2:00:17| in this group that KUB and city council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=7217)|
| 2:00:20| and I are moving forward to put together agrees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=7220)|
| 2:00:25| it can be something that's brought to a charter amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=7225)|
| 2:00:28| after they've studied it and thought about it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=7228)|
| 2:00:30| and decided which things are appropriate for charter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=7230)|
| 2:00:32| and which are not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=7232)|
| 2:00:33| So that's why that clause is in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=7233)|
| 2:00:37| And I hope that you all will oppose this amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=7237)|
| 2:00:41| because I think the resolution is best the way it's written.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=7241)|
| 2:00:45| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=7245)|
| 2:00:46| Okay, second on the amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=7246)|
| 2:00:47| Any further discussion on this amendment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=7247)|
| 2:00:51| I just wanna add that I don't believe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=7251)|
| 2:00:53| it's a good faith negotiation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=7253)|
| 2:00:57| If we make commitments that we don't know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=7257)|
| 2:01:00| if we'll be here to follow through on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=7260)|
| 2:01:03| And, you know, and even in doing the math,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=7263)|
| 2:01:05| the upcoming appointment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=7265)|
| 2:01:08| would you still be in office for the end of that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=7268)|
| 2:01:13| It's this, there's someone who comes up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=7273)|
| 2:01:15| for reappointment every year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=7275)|
| 2:01:19| The new appointment at the end of the year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=7279)|
| 2:01:21| the next seven year term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=7281)|
| 2:01:23| Yeah, I'll be appointing someone new| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=7283)|
| 2:01:25| to take that person's place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=7285)|
| 2:01:27| Right, and I'm saying this resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=7287)|
| 2:01:30| is saying you're committing to not giving that person| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=7290)|
| 2:01:35| a second term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=7295)|
| 2:01:36| And the year after.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=7296)|
| 2:01:37| And if this committee that this resolution puts together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=7297)|
| 2:01:40| thinks that a four year term would be better| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=7300)|
| 2:01:43| or a five year term or a three year term,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=7303)|
| 2:01:46| whatever they want, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=7306)|
| 2:01:48| then we can come back and bring that for discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=7308)|
| 2:01:51| I'm not opposed to the substantive idea| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=7311)|
| 2:01:54| of different lengths of term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=7314)|
| 2:01:56| What I find troubling is changing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=7316)|
| 2:01:58| the constitution of our city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=7318)|
| 2:02:00| the charter of our city under such short notice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=7320)|
| 2:02:03| while we're also in the middle of a pandemic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=7323)|
| 2:02:05| We're trying to reimagine public safety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=7325)|
| 2:02:07| We're trying to do a lot of things and this is important,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=7327)|
| 2:02:11| but I find that when you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=7331)|
| 2:02:13| it's important to look before you leap| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=7333)|
| 2:02:15| and changing our charter is a very serious thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=7335)|
| 2:02:18| that takes more than a few weeks to move forward on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=7338)|
| 2:02:22| I don't, you would have to get reelected| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=7342)|
| 2:02:25| in order to be here for the end of the seven year term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=7345)|
| 2:02:28| I'm just in the first seven months of my four year term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=7348)|
| 2:02:31| So I will have the opportunity to be part| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=7351)|
| 2:02:34| of four appointments to KUV in those four years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=7354)|
| 2:02:39| Actually, this conversation helps clarify something for me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=7359)|
| 2:02:43| because my question with the resolution was with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=7363)|
| 2:02:48| whether you were making a commitment to new appointments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=7368)|
| 2:02:54| not those who are up for a renewal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=7374)|
| 2:02:57| and you make that determination,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=7377)|
| 2:02:58| but you have, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=7378)|
| 2:03:01| a new appointment to make this upcoming December| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=7381)|
| 2:03:04| who will be a first time appointed person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=7384)|
| 2:03:06| And I think they would have, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=7386)|
| 2:03:08| there will be, there was a question in my mind| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=7388)|
| 2:03:12| of whether you were making that commitment to that position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=7392)|
| 2:03:15| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=7395)|
| 2:03:16| And I don't believe you can make that commitment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=7396)|
| 2:03:18| because they would be here past your first term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=7398)|
| 2:03:26| The appointments that a mayor makes go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=7406)|
| 2:03:28| into the next administration,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=7408)|
| 2:03:29| just like there are people right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=7409)|
| 2:03:31| that were appointed by Mayor Rojero.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=7411)|
| 2:03:33| So that I don't get to like, just make everybody leave| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=7413)|
| 2:03:37| just because they were appointed by my predecessor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=7417)|
| 2:03:41| So my point is, is that you can't make, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=7421)|
| 2:03:45| the mayor who follows you could renew their term| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=7425)|
| 2:03:49| is what I'm saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=7429)|
| 2:03:51| The person that you appoint after their seven year term,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=7431)|
| 2:03:55| the next mayor could renew their term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=7435)|
| 2:03:58| Unless this committee decides| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=7438)|
| 2:03:59| that a charter change makes sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=7439)|
| 2:04:02| So they would have that opportunity to study that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=7442)|
| 2:04:05| and bring it into the charter and council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=7445)|
| 2:04:10| Well, we can also make a charter change now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=7450)|
| 2:04:13| and we don't do it today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=7453)|
| 2:04:15| We don't do it in two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=7455)|
| 2:04:17| The public does it after they think on it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=7457)|
| 2:04:23| and they have until November to decide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=7463)|
| 2:04:25| whether that charter change is a good idea or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=7465)|
| 2:04:29| But we just have the power to put it on the ballot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=7469)|
| 2:04:32| to give them the opportunity to make the decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=7472)|
| 2:04:36| We're not making the decision today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=7476)|
| 2:04:38| We don't have that power.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=7478)|
| 2:04:41| Thank you, Ms. Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=7481)|
| 2:04:42| Ms. Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=7482)|
| 2:04:47| Yeah, so this started with a long list of concerns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=7487)|
| 2:04:53| that SACE brought forward and many have been voiced| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=7493)|
| 2:04:58| by the people who spoke in opposition to this resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=7498)|
| 2:05:01| There's a lot of people in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=7501)|
| 2:05:04| We all have different incomes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=7504)|
| 2:05:06| and we all come from different backgrounds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=7506)|
| 2:05:10| And there are a number of people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=7510)|
| 2:05:12| from different income levels| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=7512)|
| 2:05:14| that have a lot of questions about the fixed fees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=7514)|
| 2:05:17| I know, you know, we've been here going on 16 years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=7517)|
| 2:05:22| and they've moved the dial quite a bit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=7522)|
| 2:05:24| and there's a variety of reasons for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=7524)|
| 2:05:27| But there are a lot of people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=7527)|
| 2:05:28| that don't understand their billing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=7528)|
| 2:05:31| And that was kind of the motivator| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=7531)|
| 2:05:34| for having these conversations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=7534)|
| 2:05:36| which I appreciate having the conversations with both sides| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=7536)|
| 2:05:39| and being able to have a collaborative conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=7539)|
| 2:05:43| And if I go ask the constituent and call them blindly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=7543)|
| 2:05:47| or if they reached out to me about this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=7547)|
| 2:05:49| and listening to the speakers in opposition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=7549)|
| 2:05:52| to this, one of their main concerns is rates and fees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=7552)|
| 2:05:55| And so those things have moved off of the list of concerns,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=7555)|
| 2:06:02| but that seems to be the number one concern of folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=7562)|
| 2:06:05| And that is what I wanna make sure gets addressed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=7565)|
| 2:06:08| whether that's an understanding of how the rates derived| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=7568)|
| 2:06:13| and how the bills are assessed, how you can lower your bill,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=7573)|
| 2:06:18| how the fixed fees are determined| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=7578)|
| 2:06:24| and how long they stay and when they're raised.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=7584)|
| 2:06:28| That's what my constituents are asking me about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=7588)|
| 2:06:31| And from the understanding, the conversations I have had,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=7591)|
| 2:06:34| I don't know if somebody,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=7594)|
| 2:06:37| one of the lawyers wants to comment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=7597)|
| 2:06:39| Mr. Frost or Mr. Swanson,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=7599)|
| 2:06:41| what was concluded from that original list| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=7601)|
| 2:06:44| was that that wasn't something that's in the charter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=7604)|
| 2:06:47| nor could it be in the charter to talk about rates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=7607)|
| 2:06:51| So could someone comment on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=7611)|
| 2:06:56| Mr. Swanson or Aaron Gill,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=7616)|
| 2:06:58| could you someone speak to Ms. Ryder's question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=7618)|
| 2:07:02| about her question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=7622)|
| 2:07:04| I think the rate issues are issues that can be talked about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=7624)|
| 2:07:10| They can be talked about in this collaborative committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=7630)|
| 2:07:13| that is being proposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=7633)|
| 2:07:15| It is a problem to change the charter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=7635)|
| 2:07:20| with regard to some of the rates and the way they're set.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=7640)|
| 2:07:26| The bond council for the KUV has expressed the opinion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=7646)|
| 2:07:33| that it's very important that investors in KUV| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=7653)|
| 2:07:38| have the ability to know that their investment is protected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=7658)|
| 2:07:42| And that's one of the things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=7662)|
| 2:07:43| that we really need to look at carefully| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=7663)|
| 2:07:46| before you go and amend the charter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=7666)|
| 2:07:48| and create a situation where you might cause an issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=7668)|
| 2:07:53| that impairs the bond rating for KUV| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=7673)|
| 2:07:57| when they go out on the bond issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=7677)|
| 2:07:59| because they have to go out on bond issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=7679)|
| 2:08:02| for very, very significant bond issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=7682)|
| 2:08:05| And it's important that the investors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=7685)|
| 2:08:08| are willing to have confidence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=7688)|
| 2:08:10| in investing in those investments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=7690)|
| 2:08:13| And so Mr. Mametoff will speak to that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=7693)|
| 2:08:16| much more articulately than I can for sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=7696)|
| 2:08:19| But I would say the problem that I have with it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=7699)|
| 2:08:23| is we need to study that very carefully| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=7703)|
| 2:08:25| before you change the charter with regard to that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=7705)|
| 2:08:28| because we don't want unintended consequences| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=7708)|
| 2:08:31| that we can't change for two more years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=7711)|
| 2:08:33| So if you're only gonna study it for a month| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=7713)|
| 2:08:38| before you actually get into a charter change situation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=7718)|
| 2:08:42| I don't think you've given it the attention| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=7722)|
| 2:08:44| that it really deserves or that it needs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=7724)|
| 2:08:46| to avoid unintended consequences| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=7726)|
| 2:08:49| and to avoid putting the KUV's bond rating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=7729)|
| 2:08:53| in a potentially precarious situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=7733)|
| 2:08:57| So is that speaking to what you were talking about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=7737)|
| 2:09:02| Councilman Ryder?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=7742)|
| 2:09:04| Well, what directives are currently in the charter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=7744)|
| 2:09:08| about the rates?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=7748)|
| 2:09:11| The charter doesn't currently direct specifics| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=7751)|
| 2:09:14| about the rates and rate setting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=7754)|
| 2:09:20| and the fixed fees are not addressed in the charter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=7760)|
| 2:09:22| or they are addressed in the charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=7762)|
| 2:09:25| I would rather let.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=7765)|
| 2:09:30| I couldn't hear the last thing Mr. Swanson said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=7770)|
| 2:09:33| He would rather let.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=7773)|
| 2:09:34| I would rather let someone from KUV| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=7774)|
| 2:09:36| address the issue of what regulations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=7776)|
| 2:09:39| are currently in the charter rate setting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=7779)|
| 2:09:42| Mr. Bowles, could you speak to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=7782)|
| 2:09:44| Could we also clarify that the ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=7784)|
| 2:09:46| that we've introduced has nothing to do with rate making?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=7786)|
| 2:09:51| It mentions fixed fees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=7791)|
| 2:09:54| It does not mention rate making.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=7794)|
| 2:09:57| And it was very purposeful| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=7797)|
| 2:09:59| that it does not mention rate making| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=7799)|
| 2:10:01| because rate making is how KUV brings in its revenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=7801)|
| 2:10:05| Fixed fees are flexible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=7805)|
| 2:10:10| We're also on the resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=7810)|
| 2:10:14| that isn't about the charter change too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=7814)|
| 2:10:16| So that's another sort of point to keep in mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=7816)|
| 2:10:24| Mr. Bowles, Ms. Ryder wanted to ask you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=7824)|
| 2:10:28| a clarifying question about what's in the charter now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=7828)|
| 2:10:31| as far as rate making and fixed fees, that sort of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=7831)|
| 2:10:36| It comes to race.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=7836)|
| 2:10:38| The charter states that the KUV board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=7838)|
| 2:10:41| shall fix rates to be charged for services rendered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=7841)|
| 2:10:44| for each utility system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=7844)|
| 2:10:46| and has the power to enter contracts regarding set rates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=7846)|
| 2:10:49| There's a lot more legalese behind that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=7849)|
| 2:10:51| Basically, the board has authority to set rates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=7851)|
| 2:10:56| That's what the charter states.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=7856)|
| 2:10:59| But Mark Maymentoff can't answer those questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=7859)|
| 2:11:01| in much more detail than I can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=7861)|
| 2:11:03| Ms. Ryder, did you find more detail than that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=7863)|
| 2:11:06| So to, well, Mr. Maymentoff might be able to answer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=7866)|
| 2:11:09| but to Ms. Parker's question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=7869)|
| 2:11:12| the ordinance doesn't speak to the rates,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=7872)|
| 2:11:16| but it speaks to the fixed fees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=7876)|
| 2:11:18| What is my concern is that's the concern of constituents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=7878)|
| 2:11:24| is their bill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=7884)|
| 2:11:24| They're concerned about their bills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=7884)|
| 2:11:27| And more information and or different options| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=7887)|
| 2:11:32| for how to pay their bill or their concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=7892)|
| 2:11:34| And that is something that has been a lengthy conversation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=7894)|
| 2:11:38| through this process and individual meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=7898)|
| 2:11:40| I will say we as a council haven't had a chance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=7900)|
| 2:11:43| to discuss it as a group| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=7903)|
| 2:11:45| because we haven't been able to schedule a workshop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=7905)|
| 2:11:47| because of all the other issues that are on deck for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=7907)|
| 2:11:51| We were already booked out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=7911)|
| 2:11:53| So if Mr. Maymentoff or Mr. Bolus or Mr. Swanson| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=7913)|
| 2:11:57| want to comment on, it's my understanding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=7917)|
| 2:12:00| there's nothing currently in the charter about fixed fees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=7920)|
| 2:12:05| and the ability to put that in there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=7925)|
| 2:12:08| or not put that in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=7928)|
| 2:12:16| If I may take liberty of jumping in here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=7936)|
| 2:12:20| I think Councilwoman Ryder,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=7940)|
| 2:12:22| you've brought up an important question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=7942)|
| 2:12:24| and I do want to just make a point of process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=7944)|
| 2:12:29| We do have 12 fees later on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=7949)|
| 2:12:31| So there is a separate point of conversation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=7951)|
| 2:12:33| around the particular language of the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=7953)|
| 2:12:37| But to the point of the resolution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=7957)|
| 2:12:40| one of the elements that is, as you mentioned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=7960)|
| 2:12:45| maybe not directly listed in the charter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=7965)|
| 2:12:47| the charter does give KUB a lot of independence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=7967)|
| 2:12:51| and the ability and the directive to set rates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=7971)|
| 2:12:56| in a business-like manner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=7976)|
| 2:12:57| And I think Dave, you probably can speak| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=7977)|
| 2:12:59| to this specific language,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=7979)|
| 2:13:00| but the idea there is that the charter is intended| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=7980)|
| 2:13:03| to provide that separation between the city and KUB,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=7983)|
| 2:13:09| the determinations and the decisions they need to make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=7989)|
| 2:13:11| in that business-like, non-partisan manner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=7991)|
| 2:13:15| One of the things that we aim to accomplish| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=7995)|
| 2:13:17| with this resolution was to be responsive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=7997)|
| 2:13:19| to what we felt were some very good ideas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=7999)|
| 2:13:22| and reasonable good practice that were proposed by FASE| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=8002)|
| 2:13:26| in the original charter amendment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=8006)|
| 2:13:28| specifically with regard to the cost of service study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=8008)|
| 2:13:33| And so, again, I would defer back to KUB's leadership,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=8013)|
| 2:13:35| but that is a specific point that we were very grateful| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=8015)|
| 2:13:38| for them bringing to the table| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=8018)|
| 2:13:39| as part of that executive leadership commitment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=8019)|
| 2:13:42| again, to be memorialized through board action| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=8022)|
| 2:13:45| that would speak specifically to that rate-making process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=8025)|
| 2:13:48| and provide additional transparency| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=8028)|
| 2:13:50| within the fixed-fee discussions going forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=8030)|
| 2:13:53| at the KUB level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=8033)|
| 2:13:57| Okay, Ms. Singh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=8037)|
| 2:14:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=8041)|
| 2:14:03| One, I think the charter is the tool| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=8043)|
| 2:14:05| when it comes to term limits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=8045)|
| 2:14:07| That's what was used to term limit us, the mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=8047)|
| 2:14:11| So that is the appropriate tool for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=8051)|
| 2:14:13| A resolution cannot do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=8053)|
| 2:14:15| So I don't see why.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=8055)|
| 2:14:17| So that's why I'm in favor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=8057)|
| 2:14:19| of what Councilwoman Parker mentioned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=8059)|
| 2:14:21| It doesn't need to be mutually exclusive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=8061)|
| 2:14:25| the charter, the next vote we have in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=8065)|
| 2:14:28| And I believe, Mayor, you were saying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=8068)|
| 2:14:32| that you included this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=8072)|
| 2:14:35| because it made the partners get along better,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=8075)|
| 2:14:39| or you just forgot what you said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=8079)|
| 2:14:41| But how it feels is that it's a move| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=8081)|
| 2:14:45| against the city council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=8085)|
| 2:14:47| It's like, it's this way or no way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=8087)|
| 2:14:52| And that's not a good feeling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=8092)|
| 2:14:53| I don't know why we can't do both.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=8093)|
| 2:14:59| That's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=8099)|
| 2:15:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=8100)|
| 2:15:01| Oh, one more thing, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=8101)|
| 2:15:05| The basic fees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=8105)|
| 2:15:07| I do want to address that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=8107)|
| 2:15:09| In your resolution, you say that you wanna look| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=8109)|
| 2:15:12| at environmental issues and low-income burdens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=8112)|
| 2:15:18| I don't see how this resolution addresses any of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=8118)|
| 2:15:22| And I would like to hear from Steve Smith| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=8122)|
| 2:15:26| on what the issues are with the fixed fees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=8126)|
| 2:15:30| and low-income and environmental disincentives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=8130)|
| 2:15:38| Is Mr. Smith on the call?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=8138)|
| 2:15:41| Yes, Mayor, he is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=8141)|
| 2:15:42| Yes, I am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=8142)|
| 2:15:43| Can you hear me okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=8143)|
| 2:15:44| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=8144)|
| 2:15:46| Great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=8146)|
| 2:15:46| Well, thank you, Councilwoman Singh and Madam Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=8146)|
| 2:15:50| I appreciate the opportunity to briefly comment on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=8150)|
| 2:15:56| We actually welcome what KUB is proposing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=8156)|
| 2:16:00| relative to the fixed fee structure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=8160)|
| 2:16:02| And we think that is a very valuable initiative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=8162)|
| 2:16:05| to temporarily have a moratorium,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=8165)|
| 2:16:08| to make a commitment to a cost of service study| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=8168)|
| 2:16:14| before any future actions are taken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=8174)|
| 2:16:17| In our original proposal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=8177)|
| 2:16:18| we also wanted a notice of a public hearing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=8178)|
| 2:16:21| as opposed to just having a chance to comment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=8181)|
| 2:16:23| with very limited time at the end of the board meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=8183)|
| 2:16:26| So those things are all very doable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=8186)|
| 2:16:28| and we think that they are positive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=8188)|
| 2:16:32| Obviously, fixed fees do put additional energy burdens| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=8192)|
| 2:16:36| on low-income, they put burdens on seniors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=8196)|
| 2:16:40| they put burdens on students,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=8200)|
| 2:16:42| people with smaller houses and smaller homes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=8202)|
| 2:16:45| they have this regressive fee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=8205)|
| 2:16:49| And because it is regressive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=8209)|
| 2:16:50| it tends to single out those individuals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=8210)|
| 2:16:54| that are struggling under energy burdens the most.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=8214)|
| 2:16:58| Now, it is possible to cherry pick a few examples| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=8218)|
| 2:17:01| and say, hey, there are some low-income people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=8221)|
| 2:17:02| that have high energy use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=8222)|
| 2:17:04| but both the Department of Energy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=8224)|
| 2:17:05| and the Tennessee Valley Authority have documented| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=8225)|
| 2:17:08| that low-income tend to be lower energy users as general.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=8228)|
| 2:17:12| And therefore, these regressive fees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=8232)|
| 2:17:14| tend to impact them the most.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=8234)|
| 2:17:16| So addressing those fees is appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=8236)|
| 2:17:20| Because of the mayor's resolution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=8240)|
| 2:17:23| and we are generally in support of a number of the contents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=8243)|
| 2:17:28| later in this agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=8248)|
| 2:17:30| we will make a motion to remove the fixed fee component| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=8250)|
| 2:17:34| from what we are proposing for the charter amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=8254)|
| 2:17:36| and limit the charter amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=8256)|
| 2:17:38| simply to an up and down vote on the board terms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=8258)|
| 2:17:42| And so therefore,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=8262)|
| 2:17:43| we do not see that as mutually exclusive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=8263)|
| 2:17:45| and we think the best way forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=8265)|
| 2:17:47| is to allow both these resolutions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=8267)|
| 2:17:50| to go forward to Thursday's workshop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=8270)|
| 2:17:53| and have a meaningful conversation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=8273)|
| 2:17:56| that we have all missed in ability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=8276)|
| 2:17:58| for all the council members to interact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=8278)|
| 2:18:00| and for all the parties to interact,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=8280)|
| 2:18:02| because the mayor did not read us in to her proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=8282)|
| 2:18:07| We saw it for the first time when it was on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=8287)|
| 2:18:09| And so we'd like to have an opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=8289)|
| 2:18:12| to have both fully discussed on Thursday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=8292)|
| 2:18:16| And so we would ask| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=8296)|
| 2:18:17| that either the mutually exclusive be removed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=8297)|
| 2:18:21| or that we ask them both| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=8301)|
| 2:18:23| and then have a robust conversation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=8303)|
| 2:18:25| on Thursday in the workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=8305)|
| 2:18:27| And then we can go forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=8307)|
| 2:18:29| Remember the resolution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=8309)|
| 2:18:31| the ordinance for getting on the ballot takes two readings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=8311)|
| 2:18:36| And so passing it tonight on first reading| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=8316)|
| 2:18:38| keeps it alive for Thursday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=8318)|
| 2:18:40| And that's where we can have a full discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=8320)|
| 2:18:42| about it Thursday night or Thursday afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=8322)|
| 2:18:45| And we would welcome that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=8325)|
| 2:18:47| And we would think that's the best way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=8327)|
| 2:18:48| to really build the collaborative relationship| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=8328)|
| 2:18:50| that we're all looking for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=8330)|
| 2:18:53| Thank you, Mr. Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=8333)|
| 2:18:56| I think I saw some council members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=8336)|
| 2:18:58| who had raised their hands, Mr. Roberto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=8338)|
| 2:19:02| Thank you, mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=8342)|
| 2:19:05| I really appreciate the conversation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=8345)|
| 2:19:07| we've been having on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=8347)|
| 2:19:10| I know we didn't have the opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=8350)|
| 2:19:11| to have a lengthy workshop on this matter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=8351)|
| 2:19:14| but I think we brought up a lot of really good points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=8354)|
| 2:19:18| And I really want to say very positive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=8358)|
| 2:19:24| enthusiastic support of what I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=8364)|
| 2:19:28| the administration is trying to do here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=8368)|
| 2:19:31| in encouraging collaboration and transparency| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=8371)|
| 2:19:35| and looking at the executive action| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=8375)|
| 2:19:40| that can be taken now to address these issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=8380)|
| 2:19:45| Like some of my colleagues had mentioned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=8385)|
| 2:19:48| some of the callers had mentioned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=8388)|
| 2:19:49| the only real pause I have with the resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=8389)|
| 2:19:54| that's before us is the portion about the nullification| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=8394)|
| 2:19:58| of these options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=8398)|
| 2:20:03| I do think that the tool that we're talking about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=8403)|
| 2:20:07| for making changes to the terms is the charter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=8407)|
| 2:20:11| and making changes there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=8411)|
| 2:20:12| So I would think that we would want to encourage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=8412)|
| 2:20:17| continued cooperation on all these points moving forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=8417)|
| 2:20:22| So that's really the only pause I have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=8422)|
| 2:20:25| And I think what I'd ask is just, can we explain,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=8425)|
| 2:20:30| I think there's been some interpretation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=8430)|
| 2:20:33| that's been given about what the intent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=8433)|
| 2:20:36| of that section of this resolution was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=8436)|
| 2:20:43| Could we have some comment on what the intent is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=8443)|
| 2:20:49| with regard to that specific portion of this resolution?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=8449)|
| 2:20:55| Yeah, Ms. Gill, do you want to speak to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=8455)|
| 2:20:58| Sure, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=8458)|
| 2:21:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=8460)|
| 2:21:01| I think what I want for is the Mayor's point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=8461)|
| 2:21:03| that was mentioned earlier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=8463)|
| 2:21:04| that this was a voluntary and a very good faith attempt| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=8464)|
| 2:21:06| to try to be meaningfully responsive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=8466)|
| 2:21:09| to the purpose of the state's deliverables| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=8469)|
| 2:21:12| and to hear what the councilors have raised.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=8472)|
| 2:21:15| Concerns, as I'm getting a few of the callers here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=8475)|
| 2:21:18| I'm having a little hard time hearing you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=8478)|
| 2:21:20| Yeah, just say that last sentence again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=8480)|
| 2:21:23| So it was a good faith and also a very voluntary attempt| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=8483)|
| 2:21:27| to be responsive to the concerns that were raised| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=8487)|
| 2:21:31| and that we've heard from states,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=8491)|
| 2:21:32| as well as community members,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=8492)|
| 2:21:34| and in particular, many of the council members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=8494)|
| 2:21:36| So again, issues around how do we ensure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=8496)|
| 2:21:40| a diverse link of candidates to the board?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=8500)|
| 2:21:43| How do we ensure that there's good turnover on the board?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=8503)|
| 2:21:47| How do we ensure that KUV is proceeding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=8507)|
| 2:21:51| in a very open and transparent way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=8511)|
| 2:21:54| and being very intentional about how they look at fixed fees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=8514)|
| 2:21:58| with a specific concern around energy issues?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=8518)|
| 2:22:01| So this has developed in that good faith| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=8521)|
| 2:22:03| and voluntary approach with KUV bringing items to the table| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=8523)|
| 2:22:06| as well as the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=8526)|
| 2:22:08| And in part, because we know that these are issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=8528)|
| 2:22:11| that we see a lot of opportunities to move forward on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=8531)|
| 2:22:14| And again, I think as Mayor Buchanan articulated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=8534)|
| 2:22:17| part of the concern is...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=8537)|
| 2:22:24| No, we're losing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=8544)|
| 2:22:25| I'm having it in the queue again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=8545)|
| 2:22:27| My internet's a little unstable, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=8547)|
| 2:22:30| But the concerns around timing and the process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=8550)|
| 2:22:33| and providing a way to move forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=8553)|
| 2:22:35| without putting council in the position| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=8555)|
| 2:22:37| of voting on something that has been insufficiently vetted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=8557)|
| 2:22:41| But then it's also the concept of avoiding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=8561)|
| 2:22:44| what could be potentially an adversarial campaign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=8564)|
| 2:22:48| These are issues that we're working on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=8568)|
| 2:22:49| whether it's community solar or municipal broadband| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=8569)|
| 2:22:52| and a variety of the other really important issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=8572)|
| 2:22:55| that KUV has partnered with the city on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=8575)|
| 2:22:57| And those initiatives, I would argue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=8577)|
| 2:22:59| really require a public trust in utility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=8579)|
| 2:23:02| And so we want to show commitment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=8582)|
| 2:23:06| both by the city as well as KUV| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=8586)|
| 2:23:08| and avoid the pitfalls of maybe a campaign,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=8588)|
| 2:23:12| again, that could just drag controversy out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=8592)|
| 2:23:16| rather than showing that really we have partnership| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=8596)|
| 2:23:18| and alignment around various issues in our community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=8598)|
| 2:23:21| when it comes to environmental protection,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=8601)|
| 2:23:23| as well as the need to address energy burden| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=8603)|
| 2:23:26| in our communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=8606)|
| 2:23:28| Thank you, Ms. Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=8608)|
| 2:23:29| Vice Mayor McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=8609)|
| 2:23:34| You're still muted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=8614)|
| 2:23:38| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=8618)|
| 2:23:39| I want to first get some clarification| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=8619)|
| 2:23:41| from the law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=8621)|
| 2:23:44| Can a resolution change the board terms for KUV| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=8624)|
| 2:23:49| or does that require a charter change?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=8629)|
| 2:23:54| Mr. Swanson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=8634)|
| 2:23:56| I'm working on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=8636)|
| 2:23:57| Am I unmuted now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=8637)|
| 2:23:58| Yeah, we can hear you now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=8638)|
| 2:23:59| Okay, all right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=8639)|
| 2:24:02| Changing the terms of the board members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=8642)|
| 2:24:04| would require a charter change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=8644)|
| 2:24:08| So to be clear, what is in this resolution, Mayor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=8648)|
| 2:24:13| is a recommendation that your administration has made| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=8653)|
| 2:24:17| and that KUV has made a commitment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=8657)|
| 2:24:22| that they will take this to the board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=8662)|
| 2:24:24| and ask the board to vote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=8664)|
| 2:24:28| the KUV board to vote on changing their own board terms?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=8668)|
| 2:24:32| No, the resolution will address issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=8672)|
| 2:24:35| on how we make sure the commissioners that apply,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=8675)|
| 2:24:42| that I see all the applications,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=8682)|
| 2:24:44| that we add questions to the application| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=8684)|
| 2:24:46| that ensures that people share their perspective| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=8686)|
| 2:24:50| on energy burden and share their perspective| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=8690)|
| 2:24:53| on issues regarding sustainability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=8693)|
| 2:24:56| and the energy, clean energy issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=8696)|
| 2:25:01| So those are about commissioners, how we select them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=8701)|
| 2:25:06| The terms, Mr. Swanson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=8706)|
| 2:25:10| I'm sorry, I did not mean to interrupt you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=8710)|
| 2:25:13| I just wanted to say that even though it's necessary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=8713)|
| 2:25:16| to have a charter change,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=8716)|
| 2:25:18| to change the terms of the board members,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=8718)|
| 2:25:22| I think what the resolution anticipates and hopes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=8722)|
| 2:25:25| is that with this collaborative committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=8725)|
| 2:25:27| that gets together over the next two years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=8727)|
| 2:25:30| it may be that we all come to the ballot together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=8730)|
| 2:25:34| two years from now with a suggestion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=8734)|
| 2:25:36| of changing the terms of the various commission members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=8736)|
| 2:25:40| in a way that we all agree on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=8740)|
| 2:25:43| doing it in a non-divisive fashion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=8743)|
| 2:25:46| rather than in a more divisive sort of hurried fashion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=8746)|
| 2:25:50| So there's nothing that would prevent us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=8750)|
| 2:25:53| from coming back for a charter change in two years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=8753)|
| 2:25:56| If people reviewing it very carefully| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=8756)|
| 2:26:00| feel like that's the best way to go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=8760)|
| 2:26:04| with regard to the terms of board members,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=8764)|
| 2:26:07| that can be done in two years with no problem at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=8767)|
| 2:26:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=8770)|
| 2:26:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=8772)|
| 2:26:13| Vice Mayor McKenzie, did you have any?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=8773)|
| 2:26:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=8776)|
| 2:26:17| So, Mayor, again, I appreciate the resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=8777)|
| 2:26:21| I think that it does provide a framework| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=8781)|
| 2:26:24| that addresses a lot of the things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=8784)|
| 2:26:27| that were brought to us as concerns through SACE| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=8787)|
| 2:26:31| and some other organizations and community members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=8791)|
| 2:26:34| other than the board term limits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=8794)|
| 2:26:37| Mm-hmm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=8797)|
| 2:26:39| It sounds like this is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=8799)|
| 2:26:41| I like some of the things that are put in here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=8801)|
| 2:26:44| I think that, again, it's gonna require| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=8804)|
| 2:26:48| all of us being intentional from KUB's board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=8808)|
| 2:26:52| as well as us as a council going forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=8812)|
| 2:26:55| in who is actually appointed to the KUB board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=8815)|
| 2:26:58| I know that that is the mayor's appointment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=8818)|
| 2:26:59| but in the spirit of collaboration,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=8819)|
| 2:27:01| I think, Mayor, I hear you saying that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=8821)|
| 2:27:03| council will have more input potentially| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=8823)|
| 2:27:07| and access to help review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=8827)|
| 2:27:09| look at those applications as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=8829)|
| 2:27:12| So we can ensure that it is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=8832)|
| 2:27:14| there's at least one person from the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=8834)|
| 2:27:19| that we could say is the low-income board member.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=8839)|
| 2:27:23| However, I don't necessarily,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=8843)|
| 2:27:24| I think that term's a little offensive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=8844)|
| 2:27:26| but if for all intents and purposes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=8846)|
| 2:27:28| a person who is from the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=8848)|
| 2:27:31| who potentially lives in a housing development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=8851)|
| 2:27:35| and would better understand those particular needs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=8855)|
| 2:27:39| to serve on the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=8859)|
| 2:27:41| So with that said, I think that this resolution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=8861)|
| 2:27:46| again, provides the framework,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=8866)|
| 2:27:48| but a lot of additional work would have to go into that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=8868)|
| 2:27:51| I would just want to ensure that council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=8871)|
| 2:27:53| will be intimately involved in building that framework| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=8873)|
| 2:27:59| or that information is going to come back to council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=8879)|
| 2:28:02| as it moves forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=8882)|
| 2:28:04| just to ensure that our input is heard as well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=8884)|
| 2:28:08| and that we're in agreement with the direction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=8888)|
| 2:28:13| that this is moving forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=8893)|
| 2:28:17| Yeah, I think that I'm very much in favor of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=8897)|
| 2:28:22| This resolution talks about a series of strategies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=8902)|
| 2:28:25| And if you approve this resolution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=8905)|
| 2:28:28| it's endorsing those strategies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=8908)|
| 2:28:30| One of those things I'd be committing to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=8910)|
| 2:28:32| is not reappointing anybody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=8912)|
| 2:28:36| during the course of my administration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=8916)|
| 2:28:39| over the next three and a half years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=8919)|
| 2:28:41| So that would be four people who would not be reappointed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=8921)|
| 2:28:46| And one seven-year term is, anyhow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=8926)|
| 2:28:50| So, and I think that committee can examine these issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=8930)|
| 2:28:54| at greater length, just like we've discussed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=8934)|
| 2:28:56| So that's the reason I didn't, Ms. Singh,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=8936)|
| 2:29:00| I'm sorry that your impression of that particular clause| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=8940)|
| 2:29:07| was that it was negative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=8947)|
| 2:29:11| That was not my intent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=8951)|
| 2:29:12| but I realized intentions aren't as important as the impact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=8952)|
| 2:29:16| And so my intent was to say that this is the way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=8956)|
| 2:29:21| that I recommend we go forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=8961)|
| 2:29:23| that I think is the best way to deal with all the issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=8963)|
| 2:29:27| including further examination of improved term limits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=8967)|
| 2:29:30| but just with a little more examination| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=8970)|
| 2:29:32| than just a few weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=8972)|
| 2:29:36| The motion on the floor is an amendment about section five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=8976)|
| 2:29:41| It's been made by Ms. Parker, seconded by Ms. Singh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=8981)|
| 2:29:46| Is there, are there any further questions or discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=8986)|
| 2:29:48| on this particular amendment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=8988)|
| 2:29:53| Okay, does everyone understand the amendment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=8993)|
| 2:29:57| Okay, so seeing no further.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=8997)|
| 2:29:57| Could I clarify that the language was to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=8997)|
| 2:30:02| to strike everything beginning with word provided,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=9002)|
| 2:30:05| however, the nullification component of the section.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=9005)|
| 2:30:11| Is that, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=9011)|
| 2:30:13| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=9013)|
| 2:30:16| Okay, does everyone understand the proposed amendment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=9016)|
| 2:30:20| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=9020)|
| 2:30:21| Any further questions on the proposed amendment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=9021)|
| 2:30:23| Are we ready to vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=9023)|
| 2:30:24| Mr. Roberto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=9024)|
| 2:30:26| Thank you, mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=9026)|
| 2:30:28| Was there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=9028)|
| 2:30:30| Ms. Singh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=9030)|
| 2:30:31| Okay, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=9031)|
| 2:30:32| I just wanted to make sure procedurally| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=9032)|
| 2:30:33| that we had a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=9033)|
| 2:30:35| Thank you, I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=9035)|
| 2:30:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=9036)|

| 2:31:02| Council Member Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=9062)|
| 2:31:04| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=9064)|
| 2:31:06| Council Member Fugate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=9066)|
| 2:31:09| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=9069)|
| 2:31:12| And Vice Mayor McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=9072)|
| 2:31:14| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=9074)|
| 2:31:16| Okay, the motion to amend passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=9076)|
| 2:31:18| Now we're back to the original motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=9078)|
| 2:31:21| on the resolution as amended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=9081)|
| 2:31:22| Is there any further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=9082)|
| 2:31:25| Mr. Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=9085)|
| 2:31:26| Yeah, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=9086)|
| 2:31:28| I've spoken with about 60 members of the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=9088)|
| 2:31:31| that range from, and probably equal parts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=9091)|
| 2:31:34| but on both sides of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=9094)|
| 2:31:35| And I've spent many, many hours with members of SACE| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=9095)|
| 2:31:40| and community voices and others listening well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=9100)|
| 2:31:43| and trying to understand the heart of the matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=9103)|
| 2:31:46| I think when this issue started,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=9106)|
| 2:31:48| there were 12 or 13 items that were suggested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=9108)|
| 2:31:53| And I think the crux of those are transparency,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=9113)|
| 2:31:58| public voice, accountability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=9118)|
| 2:32:02| and reducing the burden of fixed fees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=9122)|
| 2:32:05| And so I feel like these measures in this proposal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=9125)|
| 2:32:09| are a good collaborative step forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=9129)|
| 2:32:13| in most of those changes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=9133)|
| 2:32:15| including revamping the board appointment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=9135)|
| 2:32:18| the commitment of five years of fixed fee freeze| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=9138)|
| 2:32:25| and conducting a service study that will be public noticed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=9145)|
| 2:32:28| and the community can specifically weigh in on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=9148)|
| 2:32:34| So I think this is a good proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=9154)|
| 2:32:37| I think it's a big step forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=9157)|
| 2:32:40| for the public utility oversight of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=9160)|
| 2:32:44| The mayor, you now and council have oversight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=9164)|
| 2:32:49| of who gets appointed to that board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=9169)|
| 2:32:52| We have the right to question anybody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=9172)|
| 2:32:55| that gets nominated for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=9175)|
| 2:32:56| And as the result of this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=9176)|
| 2:32:57| we'll see everyone that is nominated for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=9177)|
| 2:33:00| So 99% of the core asks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=9180)|
| 2:33:05| and the things that I think regular folks want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=9185)|
| 2:33:09| Most poignantly, as Councilman Ryder pointed out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=9189)|
| 2:33:13| the cost of fixed fees and the burden associated with it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=9193)|
| 2:33:17| are addressed in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=9197)|
| 2:33:18| So I'll be supporting the proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=9198)|
| 2:33:24| Thank you, Council Member Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=9204)|
| 2:33:25| Any further discussion or questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=9205)|
| 2:33:27| Ms. Fugate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=9207)|
| 2:33:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=9209)|
| 2:33:30| Thank you, mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=9210)|
| 2:33:33| We can't hear you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=9213)|
| 2:33:35| Okay, I also intend to support this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=9215)|
| 2:33:39| What I will say is I think we need to realize| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=9219)|
| 2:33:43| that council has always had authority| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=9223)|
| 2:33:46| over who gets appointed to the KUB board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=9226)|
| 2:33:51| Whether council has chosen to exercise that authority| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=9231)|
| 2:33:55| or not is a different matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=9235)|
| 2:33:58| I think we need to be honest with the fact that yes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=9238)|
| 2:34:02| perhaps the selection process of who comes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=9242)|
| 2:34:05| but like everything that comes to us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=9245)|
| 2:34:07| as a mayor recommendation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=9247)|
| 2:34:09| council always has the ability to question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=9249)|
| 2:34:13| and do our own digging| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=9253)|
| 2:34:16| and decide whether we support this or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=9256)|
| 2:34:20| I will say I voted for the severance of the amendment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=9260)|
| 2:34:25| but I will tell you I struggle with that somewhat| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=9265)|
| 2:34:28| because in good faith,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=9268)|
| 2:34:32| the mayor negotiated with KUB to something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=9272)|
| 2:34:38| and that was part of what KUB agreed to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=9278)|
| 2:34:42| I understand why I don't like our hands being tied| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=9282)|
| 2:34:45| and that's why I voted for the severance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=9285)|
| 2:34:48| but I do think we need to acknowledge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=9288)|
| 2:34:51| that the mayor did a whole lot of work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=9291)|
| 2:34:53| with KUB in good faith back when what was before us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=9293)|
| 2:34:59| was much different than what keeps changing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=9299)|
| 2:35:02| every time we talk about the charter amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=9302)|
| 2:35:06| So I just wanted to go on the record with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=9306)|
| 2:35:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=9308)|
| 2:35:10| Thank you, Council Member Fugate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=9310)|
| 2:35:11| Any further questions or discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=9311)|
| 2:35:15| All right, seeing none.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=9315)|
| 2:35:16| Oh, Mr. Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=9316)|
| 2:35:17| I have one more comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=9317)|
| 2:35:18| I agree with Council Member Parker's comment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=9318)|
| 2:35:22| associated with the community advisory panel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=9322)|
| 2:35:25| I like the intent of it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=9325)|
| 2:35:27| and I think that the recommendations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=9327)|
| 2:35:29| and the folks that will be on that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=9329)|
| 2:35:32| as suggested by Mr. Bolus,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=9332)|
| 2:35:35| will allow us to continue to make change,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=9335)|
| 2:35:41| but sometimes additional oversight takes you further away| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=9341)|
| 2:35:44| from the direct communication| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=9344)|
| 2:35:45| with the folks in authority positions now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=9345)|
| 2:35:48| So I just don't wanna lose the direct communication| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=9348)|
| 2:35:54| between the community and KUB and the administration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=9354)|
| 2:36:02| by having a community advisory panel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=9362)|
| 2:36:04| The intent of it is great,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=9364)|
| 2:36:06| but the good news is I think that we have a board at KUB| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=9366)|
| 2:36:11| who is willing to make these changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=9371)|
| 2:36:13| We have an administration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=9373)|
| 2:36:14| who's willing to make these changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=9374)|
| 2:36:16| And I assume we're gonna have a council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=9376)|
