| 0:00:00| Okay, thank you so much for joining us and we'll see you next time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220127-one-year-plan?start=0)|
| 0:00:30| Hi, everyone, thanks for joining us today. We are going to be talking about the 2022 one-year plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220127-one-year-plan?start=30)|
| 0:00:38| For those of you who are not familiar with the one-year plan, it is updated annually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220127-one-year-plan?start=38)|
| 0:00:48| So we're going to talk just briefly about the one-year plan to kind of get you all a little bit more familiar with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220127-one-year-plan?start=48)|
| 0:00:55| Just give me just a second here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220127-one-year-plan?start=55)|
| 0:01:03| OK, so we're going to talk a little bit about how the one-year plan fits in with other plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220127-one-year-plan?start=63)|
| 0:01:07| What's the purpose of the one-year plan? And we're going to delve a little bit into the updates that we've made this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220127-one-year-plan?start=67)|
| 0:01:14| And then I'll also review the resources that are available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220127-one-year-plan?start=74)|
| 0:01:20| So we do have a lot of plans in Knoxville and Knox County. So the two overarching plans that we have, one is called the 20-year growth plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220127-one-year-plan?start=80)|
| 0:01:30| The other is called the 30-year general plan. And the growth plan divides the county into several different categories, if you will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220127-one-year-plan?start=90)|
| 0:01:39| So it starts off in the center with city limits. And then from there, it expands to what's called the urban growth boundary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220127-one-year-plan?start=99)|
| 0:01:47| And that is roughly described as a reasonably compact area that would be out of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220127-one-year-plan?start=107)|
| 0:01:53| Recording in progress.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220127-one-year-plan?start=113)|
| 0:01:57| That's OK. Anyway, so the urban growth boundary is supposed to accommodate the city's growth over 20 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220127-one-year-plan?start=117)|
| 0:02:04| And then zooming out further from there. Oh, it kicked me out of my.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220127-one-year-plan?start=124)|
| 0:02:14| OK, so from there it goes into what's called the planned growth area, and that would be to accommodate the growth that's expected to occur in unincorporated areas over 20 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220127-one-year-plan?start=134)|
| 0:02:24| And then there is the rural area, which is land that's preserved for farming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220127-one-year-plan?start=144)|
| 0:02:27| You probably know it is large tracts of single family residences, farms, things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220127-one-year-plan?start=147)|
| 0:02:34| And so that's basically what the growth plan is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220127-one-year-plan?start=154)|
| 0:02:37| And it does influence the sector plan, which is the county's and some in the city's plans that divide into 12 different sectors, some in the city, some in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220127-one-year-plan?start=157)|
| 0:02:49| And those kind of get into the zoning that would be allowed within their borders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220127-one-year-plan?start=169)|
| 0:02:54| And that's also influenced by the 30 year general plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220127-one-year-plan?start=174)|
| 0:02:58| The city's counterpart to the sector plan is the one year plan, which is what we're going to talk about today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220127-one-year-plan?start=178)|
| 0:03:03| So that's kind of a lot of information to to boil it down into a really, really simple look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220127-one-year-plan?start=183)|
| 0:03:10| The growth policy plan and the 30 year plan, they're not really linked, although they do both inform the sector plan and the one year plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220127-one-year-plan?start=190)|
| 0:03:16| And both of all those inform the smaller plans that we do in the studies that we do here in planning consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220127-one-year-plan?start=196)|
| 0:03:24| That's the purpose of the one year plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220127-one-year-plan?start=204)|
| 0:03:28| If we could have everybody mute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220127-one-year-plan?start=208)|
| 0:03:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220127-one-year-plan?start=218)|
| 0:03:39| So, again, the one year plan is the basis for zoning within city limits, and it serves as a guide for growth, preservation and enhancement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220127-one-year-plan?start=219)|
| 0:03:50| It proves consistency between the one year plan and sector plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220127-one-year-plan?start=230)|
| 0:03:54| Both of those talk about overarching land uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220127-one-year-plan?start=234)|
| 0:03:57| So you're talking about things like general commercial or density residential, not super specific land uses, but broader categories.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220127-one-year-plan?start=237)|
| 0:04:05| And we communicate the conflicts between those through the online mapping that we'll talk about in just a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220127-one-year-plan?start=245)|
| 0:04:13| And so in 2022, we have introduced a few changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220127-one-year-plan?start=253)|
| 0:04:17| These are additions of zones within some of our land use classifications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220127-one-year-plan?start=257)|
| 0:04:23| And the other thing we typically talk about in one year plan meetings is staff proposed amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220127-one-year-plan?start=263)|
| 0:04:30| And that's where that one year plan and sector plan, when there's conflicts, we try to resolve those through the one year plan process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220127-one-year-plan?start=270)|
| 0:04:36| This year, we did not have any additional conflicts between the one year plan and the sector plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220127-one-year-plan?start=276)|
| 0:04:41| So we do not have any staff proposed amendments to the one year plan map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220127-one-year-plan?start=281)|
| 0:04:47| Speaking of the resources that we have in that one year plan, we get onto the Internet and we'll kind of talk a little bit about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220127-one-year-plan?start=287)|
| 0:04:56| So this is the city's one year plan website.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220127-one-year-plan?start=296)|
| 0:05:00| So from our from our home page, just go there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220127-one-year-plan?start=300)|
| 0:05:06| You can hover over ongoing projects and you'll see it there, one year plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220127-one-year-plan?start=306)|
| 0:05:10| And that'll bring you to our one year plan page.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220127-one-year-plan?start=310)|
| 0:05:13| That's where all of our resources are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220127-one-year-plan?start=313)|
| 0:05:15| So if you scroll down a little bit, you can click a few maps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220127-one-year-plan?start=315)|
| 0:05:18| And this will open up our interactive map series that we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220127-one-year-plan?start=318)|
| 0:05:22| And you can see this is the current one year plan map here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220127-one-year-plan?start=322)|
| 0:05:25| And there's an explanation of basically what we just talked about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220127-one-year-plan?start=325)|
| 0:05:29| The one year plan and sector plan conflicts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220127-one-year-plan?start=329)|
| 0:05:32| Anything that is purple.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220127-one-year-plan?start=332)|
| 0:05:34| Oh, wow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220127-one-year-plan?start=334)|
| 0:05:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220127-one-year-plan?start=335)|
| 0:05:36| It's not letting me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220127-one-year-plan?start=336)|
| 0:05:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220127-one-year-plan?start=337)|
| 0:05:38| Anything that is in purple is a conflict.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220127-one-year-plan?start=338)|
| 0:05:40| But if you zoom on those, they tend to be little bits of right away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220127-one-year-plan?start=340)|
| 0:05:43| Or this one right here is part of the urban wilderness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220127-one-year-plan?start=343)|
| 0:05:49| That's not anything that we're really going to fix through the one year plan because the conflict is with the sector plan and not with the one year plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220127-one-year-plan?start=349)|
| 0:05:56| Recent one year plan amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220127-one-year-plan?start=356)|
| 0:05:58| These are ones that were approved last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220127-one-year-plan?start=358)|
| 0:06:01| So, again, you can kind of zoom on these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220127-one-year-plan?start=361)|
| 0:06:04| You can click on it and it will give you some information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220127-one-year-plan?start=364)|
| 0:06:06| So this was the file number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220127-one-year-plan?start=366)|
| 0:06:07| This is what it was prior to the amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220127-one-year-plan?start=367)|
| 0:06:09| This was what it was after the amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220127-one-year-plan?start=369)|
| 0:06:11| So if you want to see what happened last year, what was approved by both the planning commission and city council, this is the tab where you would do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220127-one-year-plan?start=371)|
| 0:06:18| And then, finally, we have one year plan and zoning conflicts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220127-one-year-plan?start=378)|
| 0:06:21| And we're not going to delve into these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220127-one-year-plan?start=381)|
| 0:06:23| There's quite a few of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220127-one-year-plan?start=383)|
| 0:06:24| But that's because of the adoption of the new zoning ordinance in 2020.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220127-one-year-plan?start=384)|
| 0:06:29| And when that occurred, there was some resulting conflicts with the one year plan in terms of things that were changed within the land use classifications or within the zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220127-one-year-plan?start=389)|
| 0:06:40| And they were planning on updating these when we do the sector plan updates and then concurrently doing it in the one year plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220127-one-year-plan?start=400)|
| 0:06:49| So there are some conflicts between the zoning and the plan now, but that's not going to change until we update sector plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220127-one-year-plan?start=409)|
| 0:06:55| That's basically how to use the tool.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220127-one-year-plan?start=415)|
| 0:06:58| Both of them have the opportunity to show the legend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220127-one-year-plan?start=418)|
| 0:07:01| So if you're unsure what a certain hatching or color means, you can use that, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220127-one-year-plan?start=421)|
| 0:07:07| And that's available within all of the different maps that we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220127-one-year-plan?start=427)|
| 0:07:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220127-one-year-plan?start=439)|
| 0:07:20| So coming back into here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220127-one-year-plan?start=440)|
| 0:07:21| So now we're going to talk a little bit about the actual changes that we've made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220127-one-year-plan?start=441)|
| 0:07:24| So the SWMUD2 land use class, that just means South Waterfront Mixed Use District Type 2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220127-one-year-plan?start=444)|
| 0:07:33| And it's the purple that's located here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220127-one-year-plan?start=453)|
| 0:07:35| It is south of the Tennessee River.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220127-one-year-plan?start=455)|
| 0:07:38| And you can see that it's also south of the Mixed Use District 1, which is closer and abuts the river.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220127-one-year-plan?start=458)|
| 0:07:48| So the proposed addition for this land use class is the R and 3 and R and 4 districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220127-one-year-plan?start=468)|
| 0:07:55| And so right now that class currently allows R and 1 and 2, skips over 3 and 4 to R and 5,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220127-one-year-plan?start=475)|
| 0:08:01| and that it also allows office, general commercial, and industrial commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220127-one-year-plan?start=481)|
| 0:08:06| And so in looking at that, when we adopted the zoning ordinance, there was no R and 3 and R and 4 previously didn't exist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220127-one-year-plan?start=486)|
| 0:08:17| These are new zoning classes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220127-one-year-plan?start=497)|
| 0:08:19| And so what we did when we did the one-year plan that year was just inserted the new zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220127-one-year-plan?start=499)|
| 0:08:24| the corresponding zone to the old zone in there, and it didn't introduce any new zoning at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220127-one-year-plan?start=504)|
| 0:08:29| And so now this year, looking at how the zoning and the one-year plan fit together,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220127-one-year-plan?start=509)|
| 0:08:34| we feel like since the R and 5 allows uses that are also allowed in the R and 4 and R and 3,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220127-one-year-plan?start=514)|
| 0:08:40| that it made sense to add them here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220127-one-year-plan?start=520)|
| 0:08:43| So in looking at that a little bit further, so the R and 3 and R and 4 are the two zones| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220127-one-year-plan?start=523)|
| 0:08:48| that we're proposing to add into the SWMUD 2, and this is what's currently allowed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220127-one-year-plan?start=528)|
| 0:08:56| So you can see that the uses are very similar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220127-one-year-plan?start=536)|
| 0:09:00| Anything that's allowed in R and 3 and R and 4 is also allowed in R and 5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220127-one-year-plan?start=540)|
| 0:09:05| So in adding these two zones to this land use class,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220127-one-year-plan?start=545)|
| 0:09:09| we're not introducing any new land uses and specific land uses into that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220127-one-year-plan?start=549)|
| 0:09:16| So now we're going to the BP2 land use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220127-one-year-plan?start=556)|
| 0:09:19| That stands for Business Park Type 2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220127-one-year-plan?start=559)|
| 0:09:22| There's two different BPs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220127-one-year-plan?start=562)|
| 0:09:24| There's Type 1 and Type 2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220127-one-year-plan?start=564)|
| 0:09:26| They're very, very similar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220127-one-year-plan?start=566)|
| 0:09:28| This is the location for both.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220127-one-year-plan?start=568)|
| 0:09:30| They're exactly the same, relatively flat sites, large sites away from low-| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220127-one-year-plan?start=570)|
| 0:09:34| and medium-density areas, areas with freeway and arterial highway access, and so on and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220127-one-year-plan?start=574)|
| 0:09:41| The permitted zones, you can see, are also very similar,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220127-one-year-plan?start=581)|
| 0:09:44| with the exception that the Business Park Type 1 allows IMU.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220127-one-year-plan?start=584)|
| 0:09:48| Business Park Type 2 does not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220127-one-year-plan?start=588)|
| 0:09:51| And then when we look at the uses that are allowed between these two,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220127-one-year-plan?start=591)|
| 0:09:55| Type 1 is for regionally-oriented warehouse distribution centers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220127-one-year-plan?start=595)|
| 0:09:59| whereas Type 2 is more for locally-oriented warehouse distribution centers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220127-one-year-plan?start=599)|
| 0:10:03| and also retail and restaurant services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220127-one-year-plan?start=603)|
| 0:10:05| And this is some of what IMU addresses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220127-one-year-plan?start=605)|
| 0:10:07| It's for more smaller-scale industrial mixed use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220127-one-year-plan?start=607)|
| 0:10:12| also allows for restaurants and things of that nature, and even some residential uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220127-one-year-plan?start=612)|
| 0:10:16| So IMU is definitely compatible with the uses that are allowed in BP2 and more so than BP1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220127-one-year-plan?start=616)|
| 0:10:25| So in looking at how that affects any properties today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220127-one-year-plan?start=625)|
| 0:10:29| there currently are no properties with this land use designation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220127-one-year-plan?start=629)|
| 0:10:32| Right now the BP2 land use class primarily exists within the mixed-use districts that we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220127-one-year-plan?start=632)|
| 0:10:39| There are several of those in different areas of the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220127-one-year-plan?start=639)|
| 0:10:41| where sometimes there's a group of different uses that would fit an area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220127-one-year-plan?start=641)|
| 0:10:47| So instead of assigning it one land use class, if there's five that will fit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220127-one-year-plan?start=647)|
| 0:10:51| we give it a mixed-use special district designation and lock those five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220127-one-year-plan?start=651)|
| 0:10:55| And so these are the scenarios where the BP2 land use class is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220127-one-year-plan?start=655)|
| 0:10:59| So it only affects properties in those areas where the BP2 would be one of many allowed uses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220127-one-year-plan?start=659)|
| 0:11:06| or if someone wanted to request a plan amendment to BP2 in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220127-one-year-plan?start=666)|
| 0:11:14| So the next land use class category, I guess, that we introduce new zoning into| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220127-one-year-plan?start=674)|
| 0:11:22| is some of the higher-density land use classes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220127-one-year-plan?start=682)|
| 0:11:25| So that's MDR, which is medium-density residential, MDR-O,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220127-one-year-plan?start=685)|
| 0:11:29| which is a combination of medium-density residential and office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220127-one-year-plan?start=689)|
| 0:11:34| and HDR, which is high-density residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220127-one-year-plan?start=694)|
| 0:11:39| And so we are proposing to add the RN-2 districts into the MDR and MDR-O land classes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220127-one-year-plan?start=699)|
| 0:11:45| and RN-1, RN-2, RN-3, and RN-4 into HDR.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220127-one-year-plan?start=705)|
| 0:11:50| And so for those of you who may not be familiar with our zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220127-one-year-plan?start=710)|
| 0:11:54| RN-1 and RN-2 are single-family districts, whereas RN-3 and RN-4 are general residential districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220127-one-year-plan?start=714)|
| 0:12:01| And so because this is similar to the scenario we saw earlier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220127-one-year-plan?start=721)|
| 0:12:07| the uses that are allowed in these smaller, less-density, less-dense residential zones| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220127-one-year-plan?start=727)|
| 0:12:15| are the same as the ones that are allowed in the larger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220127-one-year-plan?start=735)|
| 0:12:18| And so we're not introducing any new specific land uses into these land use classes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220127-one-year-plan?start=738)|
| 0:12:22| by introducing these zones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220127-one-year-plan?start=742)|
| 0:12:24| And this is just a chart that illustrates that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220127-one-year-plan?start=744)|
| 0:12:26| This is from the city zoning ordinance, and you can see here these are the two zones that are allowed in LDR,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220127-one-year-plan?start=746)|
| 0:12:32| the two that are allowed in MDR, and the three that are allowed in HDR.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220127-one-year-plan?start=752)|
| 0:12:36| And so those that are allowed in RN-1 and RN-2 are allowed in all of the others,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220127-one-year-plan?start=756)|
| 0:12:40| and then RN-3 and RN-4 are also allowed in RN-5, RN-6, and RN-7.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220127-one-year-plan?start=760)|
| 0:12:44| So it kind of graduates up and up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220127-one-year-plan?start=764)|
| 0:12:46| And so by introducing the RN-3 and 4 – I'm sorry, RN-1 and 2 into these other classes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220127-one-year-plan?start=766)|
| 0:12:53| we're not, again, introducing any additional uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220127-one-year-plan?start=773)|
| 0:12:57| I will say that we're adding it as a use to be considered into the MDR, MDRO, and HDR land use classes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220127-one-year-plan?start=777)|
| 0:13:04| because there are some instances where a single-family house would be out of character| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220127-one-year-plan?start=784)|
| 0:13:08| and might not be desirable in an area just because it wouldn't really match.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220127-one-year-plan?start=788)|
| 0:13:13| So we're not adding it as a recommended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220127-one-year-plan?start=793)|
| 0:13:15| We're adding it as zones to be considered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220127-one-year-plan?start=795)|
| 0:13:20| So here's the timeline right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220127-one-year-plan?start=800)|
| 0:13:22| This is where we're at, Thursday, January 27th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220127-one-year-plan?start=802)|
| 0:13:25| We're in our community meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220127-one-year-plan?start=805)|
| 0:13:26| The next is March 10th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220127-one-year-plan?start=806)|
| 0:13:28| That's the planning commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220127-one-year-plan?start=808)|
| 0:13:29| And then following that, if it gets approved, we'll go to city council for two separate readings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220127-one-year-plan?start=809)|
| 0:13:33| the first on April 5th and the second on April 19th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220127-one-year-plan?start=813)|
| 0:13:38| And with that, I will open it up to any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220127-one-year-plan?start=818)|
| 0:13:42| And again, there's our resources if you need that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220127-one-year-plan?start=822)|
| 0:13:45| If you do have questions, you can either send a chat message or raise your hand and we'll monitor that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220127-one-year-plan?start=825)|
| 0:14:01| It doesn't look like we have any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220127-one-year-plan?start=841)|
| 0:14:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220127-one-year-plan?start=847)|
| 0:14:08| Well, with that said, you have our website, our tools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220127-one-year-plan?start=848)|

| 0:14:22| Again, kind of going back into that page, there is a list of the changes that we're proposing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220127-one-year-plan?start=862)|
| 0:14:34| So this is kind of the meat of what I just went over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220127-one-year-plan?start=874)|
| 0:14:38| So this is kind of explaining how this came about and the addition of the zones, all that's in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220127-one-year-plan?start=878)|
| 0:14:44| So if you want to read about it, take some time, look at the maps, you can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220127-one-year-plan?start=884)|
