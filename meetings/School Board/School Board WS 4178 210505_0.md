| 0:03:13| directed to the Board of Education office. Do we have any changes to this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=193)|
| 0:03:18| work session agenda? Do we have a motion to approve? Second. We have a motion by Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=198)|

| 0:03:40| mission spotlight today. Yes, I was asked to speak tonight and I really tried to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=220)|
| 0:03:46| think about what's going on and I do think we have so many wonderful things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=226)|
| 0:03:48| going on in the school, but I had the opportunity to go to the DEO community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=228)|
| 0:03:52| meeting last, I believe last week, and I went to the academic breakout session| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=232)|
| 0:03:57| and I really wanted to speak to that because it really, to me, hits a lot of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=237)|
| 0:04:02| the things that we're trying to work on as a district. It talks about improving| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=242)|
| 0:04:05| academics for all students and also decreasing disparities, so I just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=245)|
| 0:04:10| kind of wanted to kind of go over some of these things that were talked about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=250)|
| 0:04:13| and I have to say Shannon Jackson with Knox County Schools led this meeting and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=253)|
| 0:04:19| we had a great discussion in ours. Honestly, we went probably way over the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=259)|
| 0:04:23| time we were supposed to be. It was just, it was a very good discussion and I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=263)|
| 0:04:28| think Ms. Jackson, I'm hoping we'll come and do a full report out on this to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=268)|
| 0:04:32| board and include a lot of those discussion items, but I did want to just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=272)|
| 0:04:36| highlight some of those goals and some of the things that I think just really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=276)|
| 0:04:39| speak to where we're trying to go as a district. So goal number one is to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=279)|
| 0:04:42| increase diversity of students in middle school honors and high school advanced| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=282)|
| 0:04:46| academic courses and they're doing, they have a lot of strategies behind this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=286)|
| 0:04:49| including training middle school teachers and pre-AP readiness, building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=289)|
| 0:04:53| middle school teams to focus on teaching, organizational skills, agenda keeping,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=293)|
| 0:04:57| goal-setting, note-taking, and study skills, really getting kids in middle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=297)|
| 0:05:01| school ready for the rigor of high school, support recruitment efforts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=301)|
| 0:05:05| through equitable grading practices and strategic advising conversations with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=305)|
| 0:05:09| students, parents, and their caregivers. The goal number two is to increase| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=309)|
| 0:05:13| diversity of students receiving industry certifications and the strategy for that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=313)|
| 0:05:18| is for counselors and department chairs to lead strategic advising sessions with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=318)|
| 0:05:21| students in eighth grade to determine appropriate national industry| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=321)|
| 0:05:25| certifications for their areas of interest and aptitude from youth science.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=325)|
| 0:05:28| I think we'll hear more about this, but they're really trying to start working| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=328)|
| 0:05:31| with middle schoolers to really help them develop where their interests are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=331)|
| 0:05:35| and where their skills lie and really try to help them start forming some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=335)|
| 0:05:40| direction while in middle school before having to make these tough decisions in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=340)|
| 0:05:44| high school. And then goal number three is to close the achievement gaps in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=344)|
| 0:05:49| reading and math and I know we talked about this a lot, but they're doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=349)|
| 0:05:53| further teaching training and just several other strategies to go along| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=353)|
| 0:05:57| with it. But I just I really wanted to speak to this meeting that I went to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=357)|
| 0:06:01| last week because I really do think the goals and strategies that we're working| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=361)|
| 0:06:06| on with academics really fit a lot with our strategic plan. Thank you. Thank you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=366)|
| 0:06:12| so much, Ms. Babb. All right, and I'd like to now refer to Superintendent Thomas for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=372)|
| 0:06:17| his report today. Thank you, Madam Chair, members of the board, just a few brief| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=377)|
| 0:06:21| updates for you this evening. And just to reiterate what you've already said, I'd| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=381)|
| 0:06:25| like to begin by pointing out this is Teacher Appreciation Week and on behalf| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=385)|
| 0:06:29| of the board and our district leaders I want to say how grateful we are for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=389)|
| 0:06:33| tremendous work of our educators this year. As I've said before and I believe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=393)|
| 0:06:38| that years from now we will remember teachers among the unsung heroes of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=398)|
| 0:06:41| pandemic, but we definitely should not wait for years before we say thank you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=401)|
| 0:06:45| to them. Families and students, if you get a chance this week, please take a moment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=405)|
| 0:06:49| to tell your teacher how they have made a difference in your life and express| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=409)|
| 0:06:53| your gratitude. On a related note, I believe it's important not only to tell| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=413)|
| 0:06:57| teachers they are important, but to show them. With that in mind, I want to point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=417)|
| 0:07:01| out that last week the Board of Education approved a 4% increase to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=421)|
| 0:07:05| salary schedules for our certified and classified employees in the upcoming| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=425)|
| 0:07:09| fiscal year. I'm also happy to report that Mayor Jacobs in his budget address| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=429)|
| 0:07:15| yesterday supported the board's recommendation, so pleased to say that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=435)|
| 0:07:19| that will be in his budget recommendation to County Commission and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=439)|
| 0:07:22| we're very hopeful that County Commission will approve this increase| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=442)|
| 0:07:26| and that it will serve as a tangible sign of our gratitude for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=446)|
| 0:07:30| outstanding work our teachers have done this year. I also want to remind students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=450)|

| 0:08:15| and that's pending board approval of the creation of these schools and then also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=495)|
| 0:08:19| State Department of Education approval. I know that families and students may| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=499)|
| 0:08:25| have questions about how our virtual schools will work, so for more information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=505)|

| 0:08:51| remind everyone of how far we've come since August. Seems like just yesterday| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=531)|
| 0:08:55| in some ways so that we were talking about opening school. So as we prepared| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=535)|
| 0:08:59| for this school year there were countless questions, challenges, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=539)|
| 0:09:02| concerns that were facing our district, but we all knew that by pulling together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=542)|
| 0:09:06| as a community we could overcome those challenges and continue our mission. I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=546)|
| 0:09:11| want to thank our KCS families and students for their support and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=551)|

| 0:10:49| thinking it might be good for you to do an overview for us. And this is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=649)|

| 0:10:58| the ESSER 3.0 funds. Yes ma'am, thank you. So this is really the application to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=658)|
| 0:11:06| state in the state's account code format. It reflects the initiatives that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=666)|
| 0:11:11| discussed with the board a couple of months ago. The main initiatives that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=671)|
| 0:11:16| discussed at that time were virtual teaching positions, the one-to-one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=676)|
| 0:11:20| sustainability, textbooks. Also there's some building infrastructure there, some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=680)|
| 0:11:26| virtual classroom and summer transportation. Those are the some that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=686)|
| 0:11:29| informative assessments. Those are some that that I have note of. So it just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=689)|
| 0:11:35| reflects those initiatives, but this is just accounting ease, so to speak, when we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=695)|
| 0:11:42| we put this when we when we when we send this to to the state. So it's really just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=702)|
| 0:11:48| in the it's really just the technical GL codes for that. One question I had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=708)|
| 0:11:55| talking about the virtual school, and maybe this is just clarification, so did| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=715)|
| 0:11:58| how much of our virtual school for next year is being paid for ESSER funds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=718)|
| 0:12:04| versus our operating budget? Well, so for virtual schools all of the, for the most| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=724)|
| 0:12:11| part, all of the teaching positions will be covered with ESSER money. I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=731)|
| 0:12:17| also, as I look back at this, about half, maybe not quite half of that was is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=737)|
| 0:12:22| reimbursing this year's budget, and so then this will be for next year's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=742)|
| 0:12:28| teaching positions that the Quest positions. Okay, I guess one of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=748)|
| 0:12:33| questions I had, because I feel like we're wanting, we're envisioning Quest to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=753)|
| 0:12:37| be ongoing for the future, so I guess my question is since we're using ESSER funds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=757)|
| 0:12:42| next year, we are probably then the next year going to have to absorb that in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=762)|
| 0:12:47| operating. That's true, but the the the expectation though is that the the this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=767)|
| 0:12:54| will this will operate as a as a as a separate school, right, and so this year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=774)|
| 0:12:59| or for the upcoming year, we've held schools, we've held them harmless, and so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=779)|
| 0:13:03| the schools presumably they lose their, the kids transfer into the virtual| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=783)|
| 0:13:11| school, and so normally those positions would go with those students, and so we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=791)|
| 0:13:19| felt we felt okay about doing about using ESSER money because we held| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=799)|
| 0:13:23| schools harmless this year, so the kids, the positions essentially did not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=803)|
| 0:13:27| necessarily follow the kids because we didn't know, kind of letting the dust| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=807)|
| 0:13:31| settle. That's why we think we'll be okay picking up these recurring costs in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=811)|
| 0:13:36| general purpose because it will just operate much through the staffing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=816)|
| 0:13:39| formula. Okay, thank you. All right, thank you. Mr. Watson. Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=819)|
| 0:13:46| Thanks, Mr. McPherson. That was a good clarity around the way we're going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=826)|
| 0:13:51| pay for the teachers. Is there anything wholly different in this proposal? I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=831)|
| 0:13:55| didn't think there was, than what we recommended a couple months back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=835)|
| 0:13:59| No, it's all of the items that we recommended. No additional ones| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=839)|
| 0:14:04| or none that were lopped off to my knowledge. Thank you. All right, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=844)|
| 0:14:09| Any other questions on A? Okay, we'll move to B. Questions on C? Questions on D or E?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=849)|
| 0:14:23| Questions on F, G, or H? All right, moving to contracts. Any questions on A or B?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=863)|
| 0:14:39| C or D? Questions on E? Okay, moving to regular agenda items. Any questions on A?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=879)|
| 0:14:56| B? Okay, and then... I have a question on B, Madam Chair. Yes, ma'am. Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=896)|
| 0:15:05| Superintendent Thomas, what's the, or whoever may answer, what's the process?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=905)|
| 0:15:11| Is it first-come, first-served for the enrollment for virtual school, or is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=911)|
| 0:15:14| there a process? There's our transfer process. Russ could probably talk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=914)|
| 0:15:18| about that a little bit better, but once the application's in, I think they're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=918)|
| 0:15:22| assigned a random number and then be selected randomly, I guess, for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=922)|
| 0:15:28| just like our regular transfer policy. We'll build the student body for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=928)|
| 0:15:36| virtual schools the same way through our regular transfer process, which means| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=936)|
| 0:15:42| everybody applies for a transfer, and then when we get ready to make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=942)|
| 0:15:45| assignments as to who fills the spaces that are available, we do a random| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=945)|
| 0:15:51| number generator, and everybody gets a random number, and then we build the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=951)|
| 0:15:56| enrollment using those, and there are a number of priorities within the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=956)|
| 0:16:04| policy that will add weight to particular applications, like if you have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=964)|
| 0:16:10| a specific course of study requirement, or if you are a teacher's child, or you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=970)|
| 0:16:18| know, something of that nature, or if you have a sibling issue that we need to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=978)|
| 0:16:23| deal with, all of those things add weight so that when you go, your number is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=983)|
| 0:16:29| generated, you get a lower number based on a particular weight. Thank you. Any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=989)|
| 0:16:36| other questions on that? Okay, and then we'll move to the resolution that Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=996)|
| 0:16:41| Watson is proposing, so I'll turn to you, Mr. Watson. Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=1001)|
| 0:16:49| Ms. Satterfield is co-sponsoring this, and I think she wanted to make a statement first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=1009)|
| 0:16:53| Thank you, and so I just want to address a little bit about this resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=1013)|
| 0:16:58| Contrary to the messaging that the media has been pushing, this is not a direct| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=1018)|
| 0:17:02| response to what happened on April 12th. Law enforcement and security relations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=1022)|
| 0:17:08| has been one of the biggest community concerns I've heard, even on my| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=1028)|
| 0:17:12| campaign trail, and also as I've been an elected representative. This just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=1032)|
| 0:17:17| happens to be a prime time to bring up this conversation at a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=1037)|
| 0:17:22| greater length. The day that the video evidence was released,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=1042)|
| 0:17:27| there were 12 uniformed security and law enforcement at Austin East the next day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=1047)|
| 0:17:32| A student shared with me, I've never not wanted to go to school, but seeing so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=1052)|
| 0:17:36| many officers in my school made me very uncomfortable, and so that tells me that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=1056)|
| 0:17:40| while the district did try to make a pivot to a new response, we weren't able| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=1060)|
| 0:17:46| to make it happen, but that shows me that we don't know the answers. I don't know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=1066)|
| 0:17:50| the answers, and the staff right now don't know the answers to what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=1070)|
| 0:17:55| will make my community and other communities, this is across the board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=1075)|
| 0:17:59| feel safe and secure, but also have positive relationships with law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=1079)|
| 0:18:05| enforcement. So I do think that this resolution, well I know this resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=1085)|
| 0:18:08| brings it to the community, so that they can give their input and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=1088)|
| 0:18:13| suggestions on how to make it better, because we do need security in our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=1093)|
| 0:18:17| schools, but we need people that know how to work with kids, and not people who are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=1097)|
| 0:18:21| trained to work with criminals on the street. Our kids are not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=1101)|
| 0:18:24| criminals, and so it's important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=1104)|
| 0:18:29| Excuse me, this will really go for our conversations that we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=1109)|
| 0:18:34| going to have for the rest of the evening. If we can hold the applause and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=1114)|
| 0:18:37| the comments down, it's very difficult to have a conversation with interruptions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=1117)|
| 0:18:40| so for the rest of our meeting, if we can do that, that would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=1120)|
| 0:18:44| helpful. Thanks so much. Thank you, Madam Chair. But yeah, so this resolution is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=1124)|
| 0:18:49| really just to bring it to the community to say what will work. We need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=1129)|
| 0:18:53| security in our schools, I'm not doubting that at all, we do, but we also need to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=1133)|

| 0:19:01| 12 uniformed officers, the day after that information was released, we're missing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=1141)|
| 0:19:06| something, and we don't know with that what we're missing. So we need to bring| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=1146)|
| 0:19:08| it to the community to say what we're missing. Now the mechanics of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=1148)|

| 0:19:17| so I thank you, Daniel, for taking this lift as well to help me with this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=1157)|
| 0:19:21| process, but I hope that the board can really support taking the MOA| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=1161)|
| 0:19:26| back to the community to really get community input, because we're missing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=1166)|
| 0:19:30| the mark, and I do think this is a perfect opportunity, because we are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=1170)|
| 0:19:32| getting new leadership with our security as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=1172)|
| 0:19:38| Thank you, Ms. Satterfield. Mr. Watson? Thank you, Ms. Satterfield, for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=1178)|
| 0:19:43| supporting the resolution. I wanted to give the board a little bit of context| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=1183)|
| 0:19:46| about how this resolution came up in my mind. When I was elected last September,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=1186)|

| 0:20:03| some about what we're doing, and I think the next week is when we first met, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=1203)|

| 0:20:20| didn't realize at that point that we had 105 officers that are SSOs. I didn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=1220)|

| 0:20:30| certain schools, and so what I did for the next three or four months is I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=1230)|
| 0:20:34| started digging into the history of how we got to where we are, tried to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=1234)|
| 0:20:38| understand some of the reasons and the mechanics behind that, and one of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=1238)|
| 0:20:41| things that I learned in that process is, and it's reflected in the resolution, is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=1241)|
| 0:20:46| that until Columbine in 1999, we didn't have any KPD or KCSO officers in our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=1246)|
| 0:20:52| schools, and that was a response that was made at that time. We didn't actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=1252)|
| 0:20:57| have an operating agreement with KPD and KCSO for the next 10 years until 2009,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=1257)|

| 0:21:09| actually done in 2019, and some of you all who are on the board now helped with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=1269)|
| 0:21:13| that, but the thing that I also learned from from Gus and many others is that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=1273)|
| 0:21:19| neither one of those processes were very community-informed. They didn't have an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=1279)|

| 0:21:33| community because the reality is we steward the community's resources for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=1293)|
| 0:21:39| the community's kids. That's what we're in charge to oversee, and I think the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=1299)|
| 0:21:44| community needs to be able to speak into that. So my values, my personal values, are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=1304)|
| 0:21:49| really centered in collaboration and community, and that's been all throughout| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=1309)|
| 0:21:53| my work and all throughout my career, and one of the things that I fundamentally| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=1313)|
| 0:21:57| believe is that we can always get to a better result when we engage the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=1317)|
| 0:22:01| community in a healthy way, and so the intent of this resolution is not to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=1321)|
| 0:22:05| suggest any specific changes to the MOA, and I do want to speak to the letter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=1325)|
| 0:22:11| that I know has been going around on social media from KCEC. That letter is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=1331)|
| 0:22:15| not my letter. I didn't draft that letter. I didn't have anything to do with that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=1335)|
| 0:22:18| letter, and a lot of people have confused this resolution with that letter, and in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=1338)|
| 0:22:25| that letter it asked for, I think it asked for officers to be immediately| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=1345)|
| 0:22:28| removed from schools. I don't want to debate that letter tonight. That's not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=1348)|
| 0:22:33| what this is about. I want us as a board to be able to reflect on the resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=1353)|
| 0:22:36| at hand, and so the resolution is simply to say let's, the intent of it is to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=1356)|
| 0:22:43| outline a very specific public community process over a defined period of time to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=1363)|
| 0:22:50| seek any type of recommendations from the community relative to the MOA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=1370)|
| 0:22:57| The framework, if you hadn't had a chance to read it yet, is that we would have a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=1377)|
| 0:23:02| subcommittee of the board, three members, and then also Superintendent Thomas or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=1382)|
| 0:23:07| designee that would then create a task force that would have representatives| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=1387)|
| 0:23:12| from the student body, from parents, from teachers, from administrators, to civil| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=1392)|
| 0:23:17| rights organizations, to other community stakeholder groups, mental health| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=1397)|
| 0:23:20| professionals, as well as local law enforcement. We would have at least three| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=1400)|
| 0:23:26| community gatherings. These gatherings would not be opportunities for KCS to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=1406)|
| 0:23:30| say here's how we do school security. It would be an opportunity for, it'd be a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=1410)|
| 0:23:35| highly facilitated process where the community is able to lift up its concerns,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=1415)|
| 0:23:39| its issues, its ideas relative to school safety and security, and then there's a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=1419)|
| 0:23:44| very specific timeline. I've also, I know this would take secondary board action,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=1424)|
| 0:23:49| but in the resolution I also am asking for funding. This funding would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=1429)|
| 0:23:54| specifically used to engage outside facilitators in those community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=1434)|
| 0:24:00| gatherings because I think transparency is real key and whoever does that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=1440)|
| 0:24:04| facilitation, it needs to be clear that they don't have an agenda in that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=1444)|
| 0:24:06| facilitation. And then we would also engage subject matter experts, people who| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=1446)|
| 0:24:11| have studied agreements between public education and local law enforcement in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=1451)|
| 0:24:16| other parts of the country, as well as have some funding to engage subject| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=1456)|
| 0:24:19| matter experts and evidence-based practices around school safety and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=1459)|
| 0:24:23| security. So this is a, it's a very specific process, but I think we owe it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=1463)|
| 0:24:28| to the community to hold ourselves accountable to a process. And what I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=1468)|
| 0:24:31| don't want to do is just say let's go rework the MOA and then come out four,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=1471)|
| 0:24:36| five, six months, or a year later and say here's what we got. I think we need to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=1476)|
| 0:24:41| hold ourselves to a different standard. So in this, in the intent, in the values| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=1481)|
| 0:24:46| that I have around collaboration community, this was built with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=1486)|
| 0:24:48| collaboration community. So I engage students, parents, teachers, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=1488)|
| 0:24:53| administrators in District 3. All the administrators that got, I have six| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=1493)|
| 0:24:58| administrators in my district, four of the six that got back with me are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=1498)|
| 0:25:01| supportive of the resolution. I engage civil rights leaders, community groups,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=1501)|
| 0:25:05| members, leaders of other school districts. I talked to central office, to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=1505)|
| 0:25:10| Superintendent Bob, to Russ, to Chief Pedusas, our law department. I also talked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=1510)|
| 0:25:18| to Mayor Kincannon and through her Chief Thomas. There's not anybody on that list| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=1518)|
| 0:25:25| that was not supportive. I can't speak, Russ actually didn't tell me if he was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=1525)|
| 0:25:30| or was not. I didn't actually ask him, but Chief Pedusas has been supportive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=1530)|
| 0:25:35| since I talked about with him with this about five months ago. Superintendent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=1535)|
| 0:25:39| Thomas has said he's supportive of this resolution. The mayor has said she is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=1539)|
| 0:25:43| supportive of this resolution. Chief Thomas is supportive of this resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=1543)|
| 0:25:47| And if the board has not had a chance to see the letter that the mayor sent at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=1547)|
| 0:25:52| 345 today, I believe this was not a letter that I asked her to send. This is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=1552)|
| 0:25:57| something that she did on her own, but in that letter she states how much she| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=1557)|
| 0:26:04| appreciates the Board of Education and our role in providing a safe nurturing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=1564)|
| 0:26:08| environment. She reflects on the growth of our own SSO department over the years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=1568)|
| 0:26:14| and she talks about wanting that the police department in the city of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=1574)|
| 0:26:19| Knoxville looks forward to participating in discussions with all stakeholders as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=1579)|
| 0:26:23| we envision the best ways to provide safe and appropriate learning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=1583)|
| 0:26:26| environments for all students and staff moving forward. And then she also says| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=1586)|
| 0:26:30| that as of June 12th, KPD in the city of Knoxville will be withdrawing from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=1590)|
| 0:26:37| the current MOA. And she does make it clear that the intent of that is not to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=1597)|
| 0:26:42| say KPD is not willing to work with Knox County schools in the future, but it's to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=1602)|
| 0:26:47| say by withdrawing from the current MOA then we need to negotiate a new MOA. So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=1607)|
| 0:26:53| this resolution simply lines out a process to do that work and obviously we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=1613)|
| 0:26:57| would have to engage other stakeholder groups like KCSO and others as well. So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=1617)|
| 0:27:04| Superintendent, I would like to ask for you just to take a brief moment and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=1624)|
| 0:27:08| reflect some on our conversations over the last few months. Again, I want to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=1628)|
| 0:27:12| highlight the fact that this is something that did not just come out of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=1632)|
| 0:27:15| thin air and then also Superintendent if you can speak to if you support this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=1635)|
| 0:27:19| resolution or not. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Watson. And yes, let me say that we have had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=1639)|
| 0:27:27| ongoing conversations that actually started several months ago. It was I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=1647)|
| 0:27:32| think before any of the incidents that have happened. So you, you know, you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=1652)|
| 0:27:37| have expressed that to me and I said at that time, yes, I could support opening| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=1657)|
| 0:27:43| up the memorandum of agreement because again, we have I think the last one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=1663)|
| 0:27:47| signed off on Mayor Rojero. So we have a different mayor obviously today. And I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=1667)|
| 0:27:55| not sure, I know we have some new board members as well that weren't involved in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=1675)|
| 0:27:59| the process prior to. So it did make sense to go back and look at the at the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=1679)|
| 0:28:05| MOA. And you know, time has passed since the last one. So it it seemed to make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=1685)|
| 0:28:11| sense to to gather around the table and look at what what's what we've done and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=1691)|
| 0:28:17| are there any improvements that could be made? So those were all things that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=1697)|
| 0:28:23| talked about. And again, provided that everybody is agreeable to getting around| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=1703)|
| 0:28:28| the table and talking through this. And if we can improve, I mean, the goal is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=1708)|
| 0:28:31| to always improve what we're doing and do it better. So that was reason I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=1711)|
| 0:28:36| could support the MOU or the MOA memorandum of agreement. And in no way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=1716)|
| 0:28:43| have I indicated, I mean, I know law enforcement provides a very vital role| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=1723)|
| 0:28:48| in our school. Our school security officers do a great job. Our school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=1728)|
| 0:28:53| security officers are able to do things maybe law enforcement's not able to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=1733)|
| 0:28:56| and law enforcement's able to do some things that school security officers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=1736)|
| 0:28:59| can't do. And the primary goal for me, and I've said it and I'll continue to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=1739)|
| 0:29:04| say it, is the safety of our staff and students and anything and everything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=1744)|
| 0:29:10| that we can do to try to provide them the safest environment in which to go to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=1750)|
| 0:29:14| school and for our staff to teach is what what I want to do. And I think if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=1754)|
| 0:29:20| you look or look at the past years, the services the sheriff has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=1760)|
| 0:29:25| provided have helped us to do that. And then also KPD, you know, as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=1765)|
| 0:29:31| well. So I just wanted to say that I do support the law enforcement in our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=1771)|
| 0:29:37| schools with our school security officers. However, if the process can be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=1777)|
| 0:29:41| improved upon, then that's what we what we need to do. And I know from a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=1781)|
| 0:29:45| resource, I'm not sure what KPD, what their resources are in total, but I know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=1785)|
| 0:29:51| KCSO, the budget's like over three and a half million dollars what they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=1791)|
| 0:29:56| provide, you know, to our school system in terms of their resources. So, you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=1796)|
| 0:30:01| know, if we didn't have those agents, the KPD or KCSO, you know, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=1801)|
| 0:30:06| they've helped us in situations where maybe we have to move our school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=1806)|
| 0:30:10| security officers to to to other schools, maybe to do like random| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=1810)|
| 0:30:16| searches and things of that nature. And and having that law enforcement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=1816)|
| 0:30:19| presence there has has helped us to do that because we're not staffed up to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=1819)|
| 0:30:24| the point where we could. So probably in the absence of of having services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=1824)|
| 0:30:30| provided for us or to us by law enforcement, we would have to staff up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=1830)|
| 0:30:35| Um, I think I don't know, Russ, in terms of the number of positions, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=1835)|
| 0:30:40| we would have to try to maybe step up by how many positions. I guess if we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=1840)|
| 0:30:46| didn't have the services of law enforcement to help us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=1846)|
| 0:30:52| If we if I think the direct correlation, correlation between positions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=1852)|
| 0:30:59| that law enforcement currently provides to us and support and what we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=1859)|
| 0:31:03| have is is somewhere around 45 or 50. We would probably need more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=1863)|
| 0:31:09| positions than that because when law enforcement comes to us, they come to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=1869)|
| 0:31:15| us with the full support of their agency behind them. And and we're able| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=1875)|

| 0:31:33| this has been really difficult this year, too, with covid and the issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=1893)|
| 0:31:39| with not just illness, but with quarantines and having to work through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=1899)|
| 0:31:43| that. And we could not have gotten through this year without the support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=1903)|

| 0:31:57| covered. And thank you, Russ. And let me say in reading this resolution, I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=1917)|
| 0:32:01| didn't I didn't read into that that we we didn't want law enforcement. Uh, so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=1921)|
| 0:32:07| in my mind, that wasn't the intent, you know, of the resolution. But the intent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=1927)|
| 0:32:11| was to look at what we're doing. Um, get get community input, transparency| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=1931)|
| 0:32:18| and and to do what we're doing better if there's a way to do it better. Thank| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=1938)|
| 0:32:23| you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=1943)|

| 0:32:38| this resolution. It's not at this point. This resolution is just saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=1958)|
| 0:32:43| let's have a process where we engage the community because I'm 100%| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=1963)|

| 0:32:52| of the people in this room right now want our kids to be safe in schools. I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=1972)|
| 0:32:57| have no doubt about that statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=1977)|
| 0:33:00| The difference is for each of us in this room, we interpret a little bit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=1980)|
| 0:33:05| differently what safety looks like for my kid, for your kid, for our kids. And| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=1985)|
| 0:33:11| unless we're willing to get at the table and say, What does safety look| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=1991)|
| 0:33:15| like for your kids? Help me understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=1995)|
| 0:33:18| Um, then we're not gonna move very far in this book. Title is actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=1998)|
| 0:33:21| unfortunate. It's not my book, but there's a great book called Collaborating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=2001)|
| 0:33:25| with the Enemy. And the whole the whole title in the whole book is centered on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=2005)|
| 0:33:31| this idea that if you really want to move a community forward, you have to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=2011)|
| 0:33:35| get at the table with other people who don't see eye to eye to you. You can't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=2015)|
| 0:33:39| do anything meaningful unless you're willing to do that. And I think that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=2019)|
| 0:33:43| been reflective in our discussions over the last last few months, even around| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=2023)|
| 0:33:48| masking. We've had lots of conversations with people even in this board who| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=2028)|
| 0:33:52| doesn't completely agree, and hopefully we'll get to a good solution this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=2032)|
| 0:33:55| coming week. But I think that's also true when it comes to school safety| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=2035)|
| 0:33:58| and security is we have to be willing to sit at the table with people we may| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=2038)|
| 0:34:02| not think we even see eye to eye to. And my guess my guess is when we start| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=2042)|
| 0:34:06| really talking about our shared values, we will see that we have way more in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=2046)|
| 0:34:10| common than what we don't. I mean, I'm also almost 100% positive of that. And| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=2050)|
| 0:34:16| so that's the only purpose in this resolution is to say, Let's get some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=2056)|
| 0:34:20| people around together that yes, at sometimes may yell at one another, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=2060)|
| 0:34:25| let's do it for our kids, right? Because they're worth it. And at the end of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=2065)|
| 0:34:29| day, that's what this resolution is about. Thank you, Mr. Watson, Miss| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=2069)|

| 0:34:41| couple of things. First off, I got this resolution and to me this is a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=2081)|
| 0:34:45| resolution to me and I actually looked up resolution and one of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=2085)|
| 0:34:49| definitions is a resolution is used to express a body's approval or disapproval| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=2089)|
| 0:34:54| of something. And that's kind of when we've had resolutions come before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=2094)|
| 0:34:58| It's like we're sending a resolution to our state legislature to show support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=2098)|
| 0:35:02| This is a detailed plan of how we are supposed to go forward and to me that is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=2102)|
| 0:35:08| not what a resolution is. And I just even think about the naming committee that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=2108)|
| 0:35:12| have formed. We had much more discussion about how that would take place and go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=2112)|
| 0:35:18| forward and I feel like this and I totally agree. We need to have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=2118)|
| 0:35:24| discussions. We all want our kids to be safe and I completely agree with that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=2124)|
| 0:35:28| but we've had a lot of things go on in our community that have raised the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=2128)|
| 0:35:33| blood pressure of people. We've just gotten a letter that sort of brought out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=2133)|
| 0:35:38| one thing that then confused things with this resolution. We just got a letter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=2138)|
| 0:35:42| from the mayor today, which to be honest, the way her dates are, we would have no| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=2142)|
| 0:35:47| police force in our schools starting with the school year because the way this is outlined, we wouldn't even have recommendations until September 15th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=2147)|
| 0:36:01| Excuse me, we cannot hear our speaker. Excuse me while I try to speak. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=2161)|
| 0:36:05| I will say that I have told my principals, because I'm not in the schools and I do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=2165)|
| 0:36:11| not know how they work every day. I mean I've been a very active parent. I've had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=2171)|
| 0:36:14| kids in them, but I am not trying to run our schools and I spoke to every single| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=2174)|
| 0:36:19| one of my principals and every single one of them said they could not do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=2179)|
| 0:36:23| their job without law enforcement and I know this resolution is not trying to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=2183)|
| 0:36:27| say this, but even your dates alone, we are now going to end up without law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=2187)|
| 0:36:32| enforcement, which I know some people would applaud, but please don't, for a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=2192)|
| 0:36:36| period because we're not even getting to suggestions until end of September and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=2196)|
| 0:36:41| so I just, I do want conversations. I think there's a lot to talk about and I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=2201)|
| 0:36:47| do think we all want safety, but I don't like the way this was done, to be honest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=2207)|
| 0:36:52| with you. I mean I feel like it was very much a, this is the plan and I want and I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=2212)|
| 0:36:57| know this is our only way to discuss it, but that's where I'm kind of coming from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=2217)|
| 0:37:01| and I'm having problems with it and I'll be honest, I a hundred percent, I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=2221)|
| 0:37:06| mean not a hundred percent, I got a lot of emails today and I'm sure other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=2226)|
| 0:37:09| people email me the other side of it, but I heard from my principals, I heard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=2229)|
| 0:37:14| from teachers, I heard from parents and I heard from kids and the majority, not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=2234)|

| 0:41:50| and they were very heavily attended. Overwhelmingly, there was passionate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=2510)|
| 0:41:54| support for schools to have an armed officer on the premises as well as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=2514)|
| 0:41:59| improved security measures and a significant budget investment was made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=2519)|
| 0:42:04| So, I just wanted to answer that question from someone that was here at the time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=2524)|
| 0:42:08| that knew that there were town hall meetings where we got public input. Thank| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=2528)|
| 0:42:13| you, Ms. Fallon. Ms. Owen. Thank you, Madam Chair. Those meetings that took place in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=2533)|
| 0:42:21| 2012, I believe those were more administrative and a couple of people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=2541)|
| 0:42:25| have talked about when this board worked on this MOU before and I want to point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=2545)|
| 0:42:32| out that when we were actually brought this MOU in 2019, we asked for community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=2552)|
| 0:42:41| input and we asked to put it off and we were told that it was urgent and needed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=2561)|
| 0:42:47| to be voted on quickly and that nothing in here could be changed unless we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=2567)|
| 0:42:54| started another process. We were told a lot of things, but we were not given| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=2574)|
| 0:43:00| input into the MOA. So, I think it's really important for everyone here to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=2580)|
| 0:43:06| understand that this board did not work on this MOA. This board just approved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=2586)|
| 0:43:12| this MOA in 2019. Please, please hold the applause. Thank you. Mr. Watson. Yes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=2592)|
| 0:43:24| thank you, Madam Chair. Ms. Babb, I appreciate your comments about the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=2604)|
| 0:43:29| structure of the resolution. When I talked to Gary with the law department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=2609)|
| 0:43:35| asking, you know, how can, you know, what's the right structure for this? The| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=2615)|
| 0:43:40| best we could come up with was a resolution. It's obviously not a policy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=2620)|
| 0:43:43| and so that's the reason why it's the form of the resolution. I do know at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=2623)|
| 0:43:47| least one other resolution that had action associated with it and that was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=2627)|
| 0:43:50| the Juneteenth resolution that was passed last year. The action that was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=2630)|
| 0:43:53| going to be taken out of that was we were going to adjust the calendar moving| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=2633)|
| 0:43:56| forward. So, I know there's a lot more specific action in this, but it's not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=2636)|
| 0:44:01| that resolution never leads to action. So, I do appreciate that comment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=2641)|
| 0:44:07| though. Also, I can't control what the mayor did in her letter. These dates were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=2647)|
| 0:44:14| thought out before she ever sent that letter and regardless of whether or not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=2654)|
| 0:44:19| we prove this resolution or not, she's withdrawing her KPD officers as of June| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=2659)|
| 0:44:24| 12th. So, we have to have a new MOA if we want to continue to engage and we can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=2664)|
| 0:44:32| choose to do it a lot of different ways. I know Ms. Christie's recommending| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=2672)|
| 0:44:35| another way to do that. I do think it's important for the board to be engaged| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=2675)|
| 0:44:43| throughout whatever that process is. I also think it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=2683)|
| 0:44:47| important for the community to be engaged. Again, I think sometimes we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=2687)|
| 0:44:52| throw around words like transparency and community engagement and things like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=2692)|
| 0:44:56| that and just like the word safety, they mean very different things to different| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=2696)|
| 0:44:59| people and sometimes we have community meetings. I'm not saying of this board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=2699)|
| 0:45:03| I'm just saying in general, we have community meetings and oftentimes the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=2703)|
| 0:45:07| people who set up the meeting, that's an opportunity for them to share their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=2707)|
| 0:45:10| agenda and that's what happens. Like, they just report out and what I'm trying to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=2710)|
| 0:45:14| what I might attempt to do in this resolution is to say, let's have a, let's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=2714)|
| 0:45:19| have a dialogue that's facilitated where we can elevate those issues and concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=2719)|
| 0:45:25| Also, too, I want to point out that after Sandy Hook, there actually was another| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=2725)|
| 0:45:29| MOA that was signed. It's not referenced in this resolution and the reason it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=2729)|
| 0:45:33| not is because the board did not sign it. It was not brought to the board. It was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=2733)|
| 0:45:37| something that Jim McIntyre did on his own and so again, although there, yes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=2737)|
| 0:45:42| there was some community meetings that were a part of that, that was action that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=2742)|
| 0:45:46| the superintendent at that time took. I'm sorry? I think that was in 2010. I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=2746)|
| 0:45:52| that may have been before Sandy Hook. Okay, so I'm only going from what I've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=2752)|
| 0:45:55| been told and I've asked Terry to look up stuff for me and lots of other people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=2755)|
| 0:45:59| but so regardless, that MOA in the middle was not signed by the board. It was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=2759)|
| 0:46:04| signed just by the superintendent and the other parties and so my point in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=2764)|
| 0:46:09| saying that is I've never met Jim personally. This is not a comment about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=2769)|
| 0:46:16| Jim McIntyre, but I don't know his reasons for doing that, but not bringing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=2776)|
| 0:46:23| it to the board and then to me, I think this board needs to be able to speak| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=2783)|
| 0:46:28| into that. In the history, if you track safety and security and the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=2788)|
| 0:46:33| role of officers in our schools, there was two inciting events. There was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=2793)|
| 0:46:37| Columbine and there was Sandy Hook. I did not write this resolution because of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=2797)|
| 0:46:43| what happened with Anthony. I started this resolution many months ago, but I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=2803)|
| 0:46:48| think some in our community would say there has been another inciting event| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=2808)|
| 0:46:51| where it makes sense to relook at this MOA and again, the point of this, and I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=2811)|
| 0:46:58| know we've already started discussing it because of the KCEC letter, the point of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=2818)|
| 0:47:02| this resolution is not do we need officers or do we not? The point is, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=2822)|
| 0:47:06| especially because of the mayor's actions today, we need to look at the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=2826)|
| 0:47:10| agreement for it and also I want to say this too. Everybody knows that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=2830)|
| 0:47:16| we're under open meeting laws and acts and things like that and so what I, the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=2836)|
| 0:47:22| hard part in that is I haven't gotten to get together with each one of you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=2842)|
| 0:47:26| individually and say, hey, tell me what you think. How would you do this process?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=2846)|
| 0:47:29| Right, so like this is the forum. This is the way we get to do it, so I'm fine with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=2849)|
| 0:47:35| hearing recommendations and thoughts and ideas about how we might adjust or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=2855)|
| 0:47:40| shift this in ways that people might be supportive of it and I'll certainly go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=2860)|
| 0:47:45| back to the drawing board and, you know, obviously we can get some of those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=2865)|
| 0:47:48| thoughts tonight, but even if you, if you all I think can send those through Terry| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=2868)|
| 0:47:51| or something too, but so thank you. Thank you, Mr. Watson. Ms. Satterfield? Yes, I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=2871)|
| 0:47:56| agree as well with Danny. I'm not committed to the mechanics of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=2876)|
| 0:48:01| resolution, but I am committed to bringing it to the community and doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=2881)|
| 0:48:04| something different, especially since we're about to get a new head of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=2884)|
| 0:48:08| security and this is the perfect opportunity to say this is what it looks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=2888)|
| 0:48:11| like for Knox County schools. This is what it looks like for Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=2891)|
| 0:48:15| community to have security in our schools and so I support whatever, within| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=2895)|
| 0:48:21| line, suggestions within the resolution that may be, but because I'm not committed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=2901)|
| 0:48:26| to that aspect, but I am committed to bringing it to the community and getting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=2906)|
| 0:48:30| input. Thank you, Ms. Satterfield. Ms. Babb and then we'll get to Mr. McMillan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=2910)|
| 0:48:35| And this is just real quick, but I think what I would prefer rather than what's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=2915)|
| 0:48:40| going forward here, because I do, I mean I'm all for the conversations, I'm for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=2920)|
| 0:48:44| community input and talking about it, but what I think has happened is what has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=2924)|
| 0:48:48| happened this week between this coming out, the letter we got, what we just got| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=2928)|
| 0:48:53| from the mayor, it's kind of turned the conversation into something we did not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=2933)|
| 0:48:57| mean for the conversation to be. What I would like to see is maybe the board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=2937)|
| 0:49:01| have a meeting and whoever chooses to come do something like our policy review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=2941)|
| 0:49:05| where we really sit down, for us it's welcome to come, but it's much more of a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=2945)|
| 0:49:10| dialogue between us on really how do we do it and talking about it. I think this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=2950)|
| 0:49:15| was hard when it was kind of already so laid out and I appreciate the time. This| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=2955)|
| 0:49:20| is not not appreciating the time that Mr. Watson has put this into this because I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=2960)|
| 0:49:23| feel like he has, I know he feels passionately about this, but I would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=2963)|
| 0:49:28| like a little bit more of a discussion about kind of the process that I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=2968)|
| 0:49:32| the resolution doesn't really do and I think what's happened this week has kind| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=2972)|
| 0:49:36| of elevated some stuff in a way that we didn't mean for this conversation to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=2976)|
| 0:49:40| Thank you, Ms. Babb. Yeah, I think that's a very good suggestion. Mr. McMillan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=2980)|
| 0:49:48| Thank you, Madam Chair. I apologize for being late. I may have missed a little of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=2988)|
| 0:49:56| conversation there initially, but if I do remember when when we formed the our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=2996)|
| 0:50:08| group, I'm not talking about the people that work at KPD or the ones that work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=3008)|
| 0:50:19| at the Sheriff's Department, but our group and you know we had a couple of community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=3019)|
| 0:50:26| meetings. As best I recall, I don't recall anybody expressing opposition to it. It was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=3026)|
| 0:50:36| quite the contrary. Everybody was in favor of it. Now, whether it was a reaction, even| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=3036)|
| 0:50:43| though it happened, you know, a long ways from here, it was like, this could happen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=3043)|
| 0:50:50| in our town and we're going to do something, we're going to do something now about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=3050)|
| 0:50:57| And we spent millions of dollars as a result of that training people. Now, having said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=3057)|
| 0:51:04| that, everybody wants safety and they want to feel like the kids are secure in their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=3064)|
| 0:51:16| schools and we also want community involvement. What I think would be a better proposal is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=3076)|
| 0:51:27| to kind of pick up on what Ms. Christie said here or mentioned, why do we not have some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=3087)|
| 0:51:43| community meetings and the board go to those and hear what the community has to say and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=3103)|
| 0:51:56| then after that, we could formulate based on what we were hearing. I think that would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=3116)|
| 0:52:07| be a much better approach. You know, things might be different. One place, the feelings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=3127)|
| 0:52:15| might be much different than they are in another community. Now, obviously we can't have one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=3135)|
| 0:52:21| in every community, but we could have enough to where we could get a general idea. Now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=3141)|
| 0:52:31| of course, I represent the 8th District and I've already heard from several people there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=3151)|
| 0:52:38| today and they want, and I will, as a representative of the 8th District, I want law enforcement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=3158)|
| 0:52:51| in my schools. Now, there's some places that may not want that, but I believe that that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=3171)|
| 0:52:59| the majority feeling in our area. I believe that schools are much better off with trained| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=3179)|
| 0:53:09| officers. So, as Russ referenced too, you know, if we had to replace the actual people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=3189)|
| 0:53:20| that are members of KPD and the North Dakota Sheriff's Department, we probably would have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=3200)|
| 0:53:28| to have more individuals because, as he said, when they're there, they bring whatever agency| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=3208)|
| 0:53:39| they represent and I think that's good. Now, in certain instances, it may be bad. It may| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=3219)|
| 0:53:49| turn out to be bad. Obviously, things don't turn out quite like we planned them sometimes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=3229)|
| 0:54:00| With all of our, we can meet, talk, and talk, and talk, and that doesn't mean that we resolve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=3240)|
| 0:54:08| the problem, but I do think that that would be a much better approach, that the board would act| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=3248)|
| 0:54:18| as a, for lack of a better term, canvassing agent to find out what the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=3258)|
| 0:54:28| communities, I'll say, communities desired, where they would feel safe, at what level,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=3268)|
| 0:54:36| and then we would move from there. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. McMillan. I think we're going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=3276)|
| 0:54:43| go to Ms. Henderson next. There's a lot of lights on, but I think Ms. Henderson hasn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=3283)|
| 0:54:48| had a chance to speak, so let's go to her. Thank you, Madam Chair and Board. I first want to say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=3288)|
| 0:54:53| I appreciate and thank all the officers in all of our schools. They deserve our respect and praise,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=3293)|
| 0:54:59| and as a mother of two children, that's my number one priority when I drop my kids off at school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=3299)|
| 0:55:03| is that they're safe. I know that the mayor's letter is not part of Mr. Watson's resolution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=3303)|
| 0:55:09| but it did come at the same time of this meeting, and I want to say that I really am| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=3309)|
| 0:55:14| saddened at this decision that she's made. I'm not willing to put our children's lives at risk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=3314)|
| 0:55:19| for a theory that says we don't need officers in our schools. Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=3319)|
| 0:55:27| And second, I would like to say, excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=3327)|
| 0:55:32| Please, we cannot hear the speaker. You can sign up to speak at public forum next time if you'd| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=3332)|
| 0:55:37| like. Along with Ms. Christie and Ms. Babs' suggestions of, you know, revisiting this as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=3337)|
| 0:55:43| a board decision with community input. Everybody knows that I'm big on community and involving the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=3343)|
| 0:55:49| community, but I think it's a board decision. We were all elected to do this job, and it's our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=3349)|
| 0:55:54| decision. Thank you. Thank you, Ms. Henderson. Okay, I think we'll go to Mr. Watson or Ms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=3354)|
| 0:56:01| Satterfield. Were you next? Okay, go right ahead. Yes, I would just, so when I had the opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=3361)|
| 0:56:09| to hang out with the Austin East class of 2022 last week, and a lot of them were saying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=3369)|
| 0:56:16| they want, that they're okay with their securities. They just want to have a meeting. They gave ideas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=3376)|
| 0:56:21| such as like a meet and greet at the beginning to say, hey, this is what we expect of our officers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=3381)|
| 0:56:26| and this is how we operate. So letting them know that when you come into this particular community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=3386)|
| 0:56:31| this is how we expect to, you keep our schools safe, but also protect us as well as individuals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=3391)|
| 0:56:38| And so that was an idea that I was like, oh, well, that's a great idea. And so this resolution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=3398)|
| 0:56:44| or this conversation that we have, whatever format that we move to, it's just going to highlight that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=3404)|
| 0:56:50| different communities have different relationships with law enforcement. And if that means that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=3410)|
| 0:56:56| as a Knox County school, we operate differently in some communities when it comes to security,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=3416)|
| 0:57:01| then that's what we need to do. But we don't know what that is right now because we haven't heard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=3421)|
| 0:57:06| voices from various communities. And so I want to keep that in the forefront that, I mean, we even| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=3426)|
| 0:57:13| talked about, does the security at some schools look like plain clothes security versus suited up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=3433)|
| 0:57:19| in a uniform? Because that, seeing a uniform like that does have a triggering response to certain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=3439)|
| 0:57:24| communities, specifically black and brown communities. And so can Knox County schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=3444)|
| 0:57:29| get to a position where for communities that want the law enforcement in full out uniforms,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=3449)|
| 0:57:35| they can have that. But for communities that don't, we can have that too. The only way we can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=3455)|
| 0:57:39| have that discussion is creating a new MOA. So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=3459)|
| 0:57:43| Thank you, Ms. Satterfield. Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=3463)|
| 0:57:46| Yes. Thank you, Madam Chair. I'm trying to track the different things that I'm hearing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=3466)|
| 0:57:51| so I can make sure I'm responding correctly. So, Mr. McMillan and Ms. Henderson,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=3471)|
| 0:57:58| I think what you all described is what I'm trying to do in the resolution. The resolution says| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=3478)|
| 0:58:05| the Board of Education would have an ad hoc committee that would report back to the board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=3485)|
| 0:58:08| as a whole after basically having community meetings. And so I think we're in agreement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=3488)|
| 0:58:14| with that, that that should happen. So if you all can provide some more specificity about what the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=3494)|
| 0:58:19| difference is there, that would be great. But the other thing that did not get in the red line| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=3499)|
| 0:58:25| version that's actually currently online publicly, and this was just a communication error with me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=3505)|
| 0:58:31| is under the line that says about the task force bullet point three under the core of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=3511)|
| 0:58:39| resolution, it currently says that includes a representative from the student body. Actually,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=3519)|
| 0:58:44| I changed that to plural. It would say that includes representatives from all these different| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=3524)|
| 0:58:48| groups, student bodies, parents, teachers, and all that. Because I agree. I think that this is a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=3528)|
| 0:58:53| county-wide conversation. I don't think this is about one particular community, one particular| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=3533)|
| 0:58:58| zip code, one particular school. And so, and also, I said at a minimum, three community gatherings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=3538)|
| 0:59:06| And if we want to do more than that, I'm completely game for that. I would be totally open for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=3546)|
| 0:59:12| So I guess what I'm hearing, and I mean this with all due respect, is the last few comments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=3552)|
| 0:59:18| I think Ms. Babb was very clear and about thinking, saying this needs to go to central| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=3558)|
| 0:59:22| office basically, I think is what Ms. Babb is saying. The rest of the comments, I'm not heard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=3562)|
| 0:59:28| what needs to shift in this to make it be something that you would approve of. Because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=3568)|
| 0:59:33| this is the board making the decision after getting recommendations from the community in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=3573)|
| 0:59:37| a specific process. Okay, I'm not sure I heard what Ms., I'm not sure what he's referring to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=3577)|
| 0:59:45| about the central office. Yeah, Ms. Babb, correct me if I'm wrong, but you were talking about how| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=3585)|
| 0:59:54| detailed this is in terms of process, and it sounds, I thought you were saying you wanted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=3594)|
| 0:59:57| to give that back to Bob and whoever. No, I actually wanted us to kind of meet in a format| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=3597)|
| 1:00:02| where we could really kind of hash it out as a board, more like a policy review meeting. That's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=3602)|
| 1:00:06| what I mean, I was trying to track all the comments. I really would like us to have more,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=3606)|
| 1:00:10| I just feel like this format and with what has happened this week, it's kind of gotten this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=3610)|
| 1:00:15| elevated on a different level than you even intended it to be. And I would love to kind of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=3615)|
| 1:00:20| have a policy review type meeting where we come together, whichever board members choose to, it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=3620)|
| 1:00:26| not a voting meeting, but we can really talk about like how do we think it should be structured going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=3626)|
| 1:00:31| forward. And once again, not a closed meeting. I agree with that, and the other thing that I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=3631)|
| 1:00:35| should happen out of that though, if we go that approach, I really, whether it's a resolution or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=3635)|
| 1:00:39| whatever we want to call it, it needs to come back to the public, where we say this is the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=3639)|
| 1:00:44| process we're holding ourselves to. Because that's the problem in conversations with transparency| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=3644)|
| 1:00:50| in elected bodies, is we say we're going to do something a certain way, and then the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=3650)|
| 1:00:57| wakes up five, six, seven months later, and they're like, oh, that's not what we heard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=3657)|
| 1:01:03| or that's not what was communicated. So the whole purpose in the resolution was to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=3663)|
| 1:01:09| basically say to the community, we're going to hold ourselves accountable to a process. And again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=3669)|
| 1:01:13| I'm not married to this process, but I think whatever process we line out as the board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=3673)|
| 1:01:18| I think that needs to be clearly communicated to the community that this is the way we intend| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=3678)|
| 1:01:23| to approach this and hold ourselves to it. Okay, thank you. And I would agree that I don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=3683)|
| 1:01:30| like the idea of doing this through a resolution, and I'm curious what were,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=3690)|
| 1:01:38| I'm assuming you've talked to several entities. If you have spoken with the district attorney's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=3698)|
| 1:01:45| office, and if you've spoken with the sheriff's office, and if they're agreeable to this timetable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=3705)|
| 1:01:51| because this is a very tight, you know, timetable, so are they agreeable to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=3711)|
| 1:01:56| So the only bodies that I, the only governmental bodies, I mentioned a whole list of other groups| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=3716)|
| 1:02:03| earlier, that I spoke to about this specific language was the mayor's office, Mayor Kincannon,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=3723)|
| 1:02:12| and through her to KPD's office. I do know that superintendent had a conversation with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=3732)|
| 1:02:19| sheriff's office about it. I do not have, I do not have contacts with all those entities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=3739)|
| 1:02:25| but I'm certainly willing to have that conversation, but I also think too that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=3745)|
| 1:02:30| so in any MOU, any MOA, there's a lead organization, and in this MOA, the way it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=3750)|
| 1:02:35| written, and it's correct, is we are the lead organization. We as Knox County Schools are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=3755)|
| 1:02:41| entrusted with overseeing the safety and security. I'm not saying that we don't engage others,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=3761)|
| 1:02:48| and I understand what you're asking about the timetable, and of course, the other entities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=3768)|
| 1:02:53| would have to agree to a timetable, without a doubt. Well, I would think it would be important| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=3773)|
| 1:02:58| to know if they are agreeable to said timetable before we agree, or before we have a resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=3778)|
| 1:03:04| You know, we've already established how dependent we are on the Knox County Sheriff's Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=3784)|
| 1:03:09| Yeah, and I'm willing to have those follow-up conversations about whatever timetable that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=3789)|
| 1:03:13| want to have. Okay, I'm very concerned that you haven't had those conversations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=3793)|
| 1:03:17| and that we're discussing a timetable that they haven't been included in. Yep. So, okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=3797)|
| 1:03:23| So, Madam Chair, out of respect, there's been many things on this board since I've sat on it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=3803)|
| 1:03:30| that have not been completely vetted with every single entity that needs to be talked to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=3810)|
| 1:03:36| and out of fairness, I do think I did a lot to prepare for this. There's certainly other people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=3816)|
| 1:03:44| that we need to talk to, and like I said, I'm willing to have those conversations. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=3824)|
| 1:03:49| Okay, I think, I think Ms. Owen was next. Is that correct? Thank you, Madam Chair. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=3829)|
| 1:03:57| Those people who have objections to the timeline, I'm wondering if it would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=3837)|
| 1:04:05| acceptable to allow the subcommittee to hash out the timeline,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=3845)|
| 1:04:10| and what I'm thinking as, while Mr. McMillan was speaking, I felt like I had heard this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=3850)|
| 1:04:16| conversation before, and I think it's because this is the same conversation we had in 2019| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=3856)|
| 1:04:23| when we asked for public meetings and couldn't get that to happen. So,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=3863)|
| 1:04:28| what, if we don't like a resolution, what format would be better, and if the timeline isn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=3868)|
| 1:04:40| acceptable, is it acceptable for the subcommittee to change that timeline as they go, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=3880)|
| 1:04:49| if we need to have a meeting of us at some point, can that happen before next week?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=3889)|
| 1:04:54| Okay, and now, thank you, Ms. Owen. I think Ms. Christie was next, and then Ms. Bounds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=3894)|
| 1:05:03| and then Mr. McMillan. Yeah, I like the idea Ms. Babb had of discussing it like in a policy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=3903)|
| 1:05:11| review type format. I'm really not a fan of the subcommittee of the board because I think this is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=3911)|
| 1:05:20| a conversation that all board members need to be engaged in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=3920)|
| 1:05:25| because it does affect all their districts, and people do feel differently. I know I've gotten a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=3925)|
| 1:05:32| lot of emails and phone calls and texts from people in my district, and, you know, they feel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=3932)|
| 1:05:39| that this is, discussion has somehow turned into an anti-law enforcement discussion, which is really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=3939)|
| 1:05:47| unfortunate, and so I am not a fan of the subcommittee, and I'm really not a fan of a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=3947)|
| 1:05:57| hand-picked task force either. I kind of regret doing that for the reopening plan, not because I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=3957)|
| 1:06:03| regret the person I chose. I just regretted putting that person in that position, and I feel like it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=3963)|
| 1:06:09| would have been better if we had just discussed that as a board, so that would be what I would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=3969)|
| 1:06:17| recommend. I mean, I do think we need to have the discussion in that format, and I think all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=3977)|
| 1:06:24| board members need to be engaged, and I think it needs to be a community-wide discussion, and even| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=3984)|
| 1:06:31| as to what Ms. Satterfield said, it might be that we have to do different things at different schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=3991)|
| 1:06:36| which, you know, that's how we will get that input, but I do think we all need to be engaged,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=3996)|
| 1:06:43| so I'm not really a fan of the subcommittees or the task force. Thank you, Ms. Christie. Ms. Bounds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=4003)|
| 1:06:51| Thank you, Madam Chair. Let me just say this is why the Sunshine Law can prevent good governance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=4011)|
| 1:06:58| because I've heard some great thoughts tonight, which is why, and Ms. Christie, I wish I'd gone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=4018)|
| 1:07:04| before you because you stole most of my stuff, but this is why I prefer to do a policy review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=4024)|
| 1:07:11| format where we can have a discussion as a board and get consensus on how we want to move| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=4031)|
| 1:07:18| forward with this. I love Ms. Satterfield's out-of-the-box thinking about meet and greets, I know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=4038)|
| 1:07:25| in her community, and I like the point that she made, because I think it's very important to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=4045)|
| 1:07:30| realize that one size does not fit all in a district of our size with 90 schools, and so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=4050)|
| 1:07:37| each community is different, and therefore, I respectfully disagree with my colleague over here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=4057)|
| 1:07:43| Mr. McMillan, that I would like to see, and I don't think it's too much to ask, a meeting in each| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=4063)|
| 1:07:50| district, a well-publicized meeting, but having been on this board for seven years, and some of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=4070)|
| 1:07:57| it's just learned by trial and error, I am not a fan of the subcommittee. I'm not a fan of the task| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=4077)|
| 1:08:03| force and how that works, and so I would love to, or I'm asking you, Ms. Horne, if you will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=4083)|
| 1:08:11| set aside and get a time when we can meet in a policy review format and work out some of these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=4091)|
| 1:08:17| details going forward. I think that's the best way forward with this, so anyway. Thank you, Ms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=4097)|
| 1:08:24| Take care of that with you and the superintendent. Okay, we can definitely do that. It sounds like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=4104)|
| 1:08:28| there's a lot of consensus in that. Mr. McMillan. Thank you, Madam Chair. Mr. Watson,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=4108)|
| 1:08:43| would you accept three meetings wherever| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=4123)|
| 1:08:51| that where the communities could be engaged? I mean, would that be enough for you rather than| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=4131)|
| 1:09:01| going every district? So, yeah, in the resolution I'd suggest a minimum of three meetings, so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=4141)|
| 1:09:08| certainly a minimum of three would suffice for me. I'm not opposed to doing one at every meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=4148)|
| 1:09:17| Oh, what about, now, what about this? What about if we had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=4157)|
| 1:09:24| three community meetings to find out what the wishes of, or it could be more than that if you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=4164)|
| 1:09:32| wish, but since you had mentioned something about three, I don't think it has to be one in every| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=4172)|
| 1:09:40| district, but that's my opinion, and then the board would, you know, collectively attend these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=4180)|
| 1:09:57| if they so desire. They're not required to, but they could come to everyone that's held,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=4197)|
| 1:10:07| and then they would, at that point, after that had been done, come back together, and the board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=4207)|
| 1:10:18| as a whole, I don't like subcommittees either, or people being appointed, the board as a whole| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=4218)|
| 1:10:27| act as a policy review to establish what we want, or what we see. What part of that can you not agree with?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=4227)|
| 1:10:43| Mr. McMillan, there's, I'd have to process more about it, but I mean, I'm open to all those ideas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=4243)|
| 1:10:51| Well, as I said, I'm, this was my attempt at outlining the process that, frankly, I knew| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=4251)|
| 1:10:59| there would be a lot of discussion about. I mean, I didn't come into this meeting blind, thinking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=4259)|
| 1:11:03| everybody was going to love this process as design, but it was a way to start that conversation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=4263)|
| 1:11:09| and that discussion, and out of respect for the board, frankly, is the reason why I suggested| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=4269)|
| 1:11:13| an ad hoc school and safety and security subcommittee, mainly because if this is done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=4273)|
| 1:11:19| with any kind of expediency, which I think, again, I think the mayor's letter today probably forces| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=4279)|
| 1:11:26| us to do it even faster than I was, I always think we would do it, it's going to be a lot of work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=4286)|
| 1:11:31| and so, I mean, that was the reason to suggest an ad hoc committee, is to, is for those who wanted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=4291)|
| 1:11:36| to serve on that, you know, they would be able to get in and dig into that higher level of work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=4296)|
| 1:11:40| Obviously, that subcommittee would not make any decisions outside of the board, but I'm certainly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=4300)|
| 1:11:45| open to any and all of the board being a part of the process. I think that would be fantastic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=4305)|
| 1:11:50| and I think that sends a good message to our community, that the, that each individual board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=4310)|
| 1:11:54| member would want to serve in this way, to talk about safety and security. So, this, that, that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=4314)|
| 1:12:01| was not an attempt to exclude people, that was an attempt to say, there's gonna be a lot of heavy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=4321)|
| 1:12:04| lifting here, and I don't, I don't want to speak for everybody in terms of their ability to do that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=4324)|
| 1:12:09| in that period of time, but to me, the more the better, and that, again, was another intent of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=4329)|
| 1:12:15| the way I drafted the resolution, which was also the attempt at the task force, is to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=4335)|
| 1:12:20| hey, let's make sure that we get all the different stakeholder groups to the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=4340)|
| 1:12:23| Obviously, they can come and be a part of a facilitated community gathering, and I do think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=4343)|
| 1:12:31| that's an important part of this, and I know we're kind of getting into the place where I know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=4351)|
| 1:12:37| Ms. Babb and Ms. Warren want to go in terms of having this conversation in a policy review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=4357)|
| 1:12:42| and I'm open to doing that, but since you asked, Mr. McMillan, that's, that's the reason why I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=4362)|
| 1:12:48| said some of those things, but I'm certainly open to all these ideas, so. Well, eventually,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=4368)|
| 1:12:54| even if we were to go the route that I just described, I think at some point after the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=4374)|
| 1:13:02| policy review, the board would have to vote on some kind of motion, I'm assuming, just as we do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=4382)|
| 1:13:10| with things that go through policy review, but you spend a lot of time compiling all this, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=4390)|
| 1:13:22| we all want as many people to participate with opinions as possible, but sometimes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=4402)|
| 1:13:34| you know, you can get, for whatever reason, you don't get the true opinions that you're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=4414)|
| 1:13:46| looking for. Now, in your district, I know that you, that you know your district, you know what,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=4426)|
| 1:13:55| generally, you've talked to a lot of people over there, you might run into some new ideas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=4435)|
| 1:14:02| and it's the same with most of us. Generally speaking, we know what level and what the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=4442)|
| 1:14:12| expectations of security and law enforcement is in our particular district. That's why| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=4452)|
| 1:14:23| I think that it would be better to, to just do something along these lines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=4463)|
| 1:14:32| And, you know, if necessary, if it requires a motion in order to do that, before next week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=4472)|
| 1:14:41| I can get with the law director, you know, he can do the legal aspects of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=4481)|
| 1:14:50| At least we'd have something to talk about. Everybody might not agree with it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=4490)|
| 1:14:56| but at least it would be a start. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. McMillan. Yeah, I agree. I do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=4496)|
| 1:15:04| think we all generally know what our different communities expect in terms of safety and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=4504)|
| 1:15:10| security, and that, and from what I've heard from people in administration and others who have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=4510)|
| 1:15:16| helped form the current MOA, that's true in this current MOA. This current MOA is fairly general,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=4516)|
| 1:15:23| and so I think whenever you have more than one law enforcement agency occupying the same space,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=4523)|
| 1:15:31| so our SSOs as basically special deputies that are bonded and armed, our KPD officers and KCSO| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=4531)|
| 1:15:39| officers, whenever you have more than one agency occupying the same space, it demands more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=4539)|
| 1:15:45| specificity because those different groups, those different individuals answer to different| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=4545)|
| 1:15:53| entities, and so again, I think that's why it's important to involve both subject matter experts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=4553)|
| 1:16:00| evidence-based people who are skilled in evidence-based practices around safety and security| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=4560)|
| 1:16:05| and community in these conversations because, again, we know that, I think this is to your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=4565)|
| 1:16:13| point, Mr. McMillan, is that the community can have lots of great ideas that cannot necessarily| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=4573)|
| 1:16:18| be implemented. I mean, we know that. There's, they don't understand all the levers and how| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=4578)|
| 1:16:22| things get pulled and all that kind of stuff, but they can help inform the direction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=4582)|
| 1:16:28| and help us get to the specificity that I think we really need for all of our kids,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=4588)|
| 1:16:35| so again, I appreciate the conversation that we're having as a board and I appreciate the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=4595)|
| 1:16:39| ideas that have been lifted up. Thank you. If I could just make a comment. I agree with what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=4599)|
| 1:16:46| you're saying, understand that, but I think in most communities or most schools, I should say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=4606)|
| 1:16:55| the role of the person that's there from the Sheriff's Department or from KPD| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=4615)|
| 1:17:12| and our officers, it's not an adversarial role. I think the principal, I would hope,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=4632)|
| 1:17:22| you know, kind of when school starts, gets together and, you know, talk about what the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=4642)|
| 1:17:30| responsibilities will be of each one of them and, you know, that way nobody steps on anybody's toe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=4650)|
| 1:17:39| and I think that would be a logical way to approach it. That's just my opinion. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=4659)|
| 1:17:46| Thank you, Mr. McMillan and Mr. Watson. Ms. Owen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=4666)|
| 1:17:51| Thank you, Madam Chair. I understand the hesitance to form a committee on this issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=4671)|
| 1:18:00| and I'm wondering if it would be acceptable to have a committee of two or three just to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=4680)|
| 1:18:06| organize and drive the meetings that all of us could attend and give input in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=4686)|
| 1:18:14| Would that make any difference in having a committee if they were just, if they were just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=4694)|
| 1:18:19| doing the... You mean the community meetings? No, I'm thinking where it's listed as a committee in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=4699)|
| 1:18:27| here, if that committee was just to do the boots on the ground, organizing, getting the meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=4707)|
| 1:18:34| together and that kind of thing, not even to facilitate? Okay, it doesn't look like that's...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=4714)|
| 1:18:51| I think it sounds like from what I'm hearing as consensus from the board that what the majority| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=4731)|
| 1:18:58| of the board sounds like they're comfortable with would be the board doing a work session,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=4738)|
| 1:19:05| like a more casual kind of policy review type work session and then after that do community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=4745)|
| 1:19:12| meetings. Is that correct in the correct order? Does anybody have thoughts on that, Ms. Pab?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=4752)|
| 1:19:19| Personally, this is my suggestion is I would like us to have a workshop meeting very soon and I have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=4759)|
| 1:19:25| to say I don't like this resolution, Mr. Watson, but I do appreciate you bringing this topic up and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=4765)|
| 1:19:31| this is a topic that weighs on all of us right now. I mean, I do. I do think we need to talk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=4771)|
| 1:19:35| about it. I think it's a good conversation. I just personally don't like the format, but what I would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=4775)|
| 1:19:41| like is for us to come together, have a discussion where we as a group kind of come up with the plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=4781)|
| 1:19:47| to go forward, whether it's three meetings like Mr. McMillan wants, whether it's a meeting in every| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=4787)|
| 1:19:52| district like Ms. Bounds wants, but let's all kind of just hash it out, discuss it in a way that's not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=4792)|
| 1:19:58| so pressing a button and having to be called on and we can really kind of talk about it. It will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=4798)|
| 1:20:03| be sunshine, so you know, but yeah, sometimes I do think these kind of means it would be great if we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=4803)|
| 1:20:09| could just the nine of us get in a room and just figure it out, but that's not the way this works| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=4809)|
| 1:20:13| and so I'd like to do that and then kind of come up with next steps, how we think it is. Maybe there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=4813)|
| 1:20:19| are three of us that then sort of work with Carly to put it out or something like that. I mean, I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=4819)|
| 1:20:24| think that's where we sort of can't get into the nitty-gritty, which you did do here. I just don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=4824)|
| 1:20:30| know that this is the format of this board meeting to get into the nitty-gritty of how we want to go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=4830)|
| 1:20:34| about doing this. That's personally how I feel. Mr. Watson. Yeah, I completely agree, Ms. Babb.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=4834)|
| 1:20:43| I listed all the groups I did talk to. The one group I couldn't talk to by myself was this group,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=4843)|
| 1:20:47| so I appreciate that, and again, as I stated, I mean, the values that drive me is community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=4847)|
| 1:20:55| and collaboration, and I feel that not just in the sense of the larger community, but also within| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=4855)|
| 1:20:59| this body, and it's one of the things that I, again, I mean, we can't change those laws right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=4859)|
| 1:21:06| here, but somebody mentioned this earlier. It is one of the problems with open meeting and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=4866)|
| 1:21:11| sunshine laws, not that we should do the public's business in private, but it is hard to collaborate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=4871)|
| 1:21:17| on process and how we move something forward and things like that, and so, you know, anytime that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=4877)|
| 1:21:23| we can do that and especially stretch those muscles as a body and as an elected body, I think it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=4883)|
| 1:21:29| actually makes us more productive and more willing to engage one another because, as we all know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=4889)|
| 1:21:36| we're not going to agree on every single issue, but the more we actually get into an issue and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=4896)|
| 1:21:41| work it together, the more we appreciate where people's values are and how we move forward, so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=4901)|
| 1:21:47| I'm always game for that. Okay, thank you, Mr. Watson. I think Mr. McMillan's light was on, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=4907)|
| 1:21:52| then Ms. Patterfield. Thank you, Madam Chair. All I was going to say is, Ms. Babb, if you would feel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=4912)|
| 1:22:01| more comfortable having an initial meeting before we did this, that would be fine, and maybe we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=4921)|
| 1:22:10| should go to somewhere that's centrally located where everybody feels safe, but, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=4930)|
| 1:22:21| we could either go to Houston, we could go to Central, we could go to Fulton. All those are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=4941)|
| 1:22:32| no matter where you're coming from, if you can get to the interstate, you can get there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=4952)|
| 1:22:39| and if you're not, it's not that far away. You know, it's not like you have to drive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=4959)|
| 1:22:46| far to get to Clark. Okay, thank you, Mr. McMillan. Okay, Ms. Patterfield. Yes, I support us getting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=4966)|
| 1:22:53| together to have a conversation in central locations to have a larger conversation in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=4973)|
| 1:22:58| community. I would just say that I want to make sure that we move this topic with urgency because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=4978)|
| 1:23:03| we want to see something different come August when the kids come back to school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=4983)|
| 1:23:07| and then I also just, I deal heavily with unattended consequences, and I know that this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=4987)|
| 1:23:15| is not Daniel's heart, and it's definitely not my heart. It's just unfortunate now that we,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=4995)|
| 1:23:19| this has blown up to where people do feel unappreciated, or that we did have a lot of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=4999)|
| 1:23:24| comments that are thinking that this is, the board is immediately deciding to take police out of our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=5004)|
| 1:23:30| schools, and that's not the case at all. It's figuring out what does safety look like for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=5010)|
| 1:23:35| certain communities, and I just, I don't know where Mayor Kincannon's decision came from, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=5015)|
| 1:23:42| I am highly concerned on what does the rest of our school year look like with KPD being withdrawn,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=5022)|
| 1:23:48| knowing that we have short manpower from our end as well, and so I'm hopeful that we can figure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=5028)|
| 1:23:53| that out, but that is an unintended consequence. That letter that came out that confused the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=5033)|
| 1:23:59| community, and then also Mayor Kincannon's rapid decision is an unintended consequence that we did| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=5039)|
| 1:24:05| not, we did not want to happen, so I just want to make sure that the board is understanding of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=5045)|
| 1:24:10| Thank you, Ms. Satterfield. Ms. Owen. Thank you, Madam Chair. Looking at the amount of time that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=5050)|
| 1:24:18| this is likely to take, I would ask that whatever we do, that we find an outside facilitator who is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=5058)|
| 1:24:24| not a part of the executive team, so that that additional, that additional work is not put on one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=5064)|
| 1:24:30| person. Thank you. Okay, Mr. Watson. Yeah, I think, I appreciate Ms. Owen's comment, and I do think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=5070)|
| 1:24:41| that's an idea that we can articulate more in our session that we want to have. I do think outside| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=5081)|
| 1:24:46| facilitation is really important, but the other thing I want people to know, and this is for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=5086)|
| 1:24:51| public, because I don't think everybody fully understands how this stuff works, is if you saw| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=5091)|
| 1:24:56| the resolution ahead of time, you saw that Ms. Satterfield co-sponsored it, so where I said that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=5096)|
| 1:25:01| I haven't met with this whole body, I haven't messed with Ms. Satterfield about this either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=5101)|
| 1:25:04| That's not how this works. I sent the resolution through Ms. Coatney to the whole board and asked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=5104)|
| 1:25:11| if anybody wanted to sponsor it as it was written, and Ms. Satterfield signed on, so I just want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=5111)|
| 1:25:15| everybody to know that that's, it's not like we pick and choose who we want to work with, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=5115)|
| 1:25:21| to get to something. It's kind of like, hey, here's our idea. If anybody wants to sign on, let me know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=5121)|
| 1:25:25| you know, that kind of thing, so I think that's just an important education piece. Thank you for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=5125)|
| 1:25:29| pointing that out, Mr. Watson. Ms. Satterfield, your light's still on. Okay, okay. Thank you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=5129)|
| 1:25:35| and I think we, it sounds like we have kind of a rough plan, so good conversation. Thank you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=5135)|
| 1:25:43| for the work that you did put into this and raising the issue, and so we will go from here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=5143)|
| 1:25:50| All right, so now we will move to items D and E, and if I could, just before we move into these two,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=5150)|
| 1:26:02| into this topic, obviously we've had strong opinions on both sides of the issue of masks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=5162)|
| 1:26:10| and we've heard clearly from both sides. As you know, last week the law department asked that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=5170)|
| 1:26:15| hold a special called meeting to discuss the issue. Since that did not happen, we'll have that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=5175)|
| 1:26:21| conversation again this evening. As a reminder to the board, this board can amend language to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=5181)|
| 1:26:27| any motion that is made or agenda item. This has never been an issue with our board in the past,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=5187)|
| 1:26:33| and I hope it will not be going forward. I'd like to thank those who have engaged in this process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=5193)|
| 1:26:39| on both sides of the issues, whether you've called or emailed, come to meetings, spoken at public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=5199)|
| 1:26:44| forum. I appreciate you using and exercising your First Amendment right and engaging in the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=5204)|
| 1:26:50| We have been elected to represent our constituents, but it's vital that we hear| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=5210)|
| 1:26:55| from you so that we can adequately represent you. The reason we've talked about masks so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=5215)|
| 1:27:03| much over the past few months is because that's what we've heard from the public most often about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=5223)|
| 1:27:08| When I have personally advocated for band and theater students not to have to wear masks during| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=5228)|
| 1:27:12| performances or kids not to wear masks during recess, this is because that's what my constituents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=5232)|
| 1:27:18| have been asking me to advocate for. These things don't affect my family at all. I'm simply advocating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=5238)|
| 1:27:25| for my constituents, and that's what we're all here to do. So with that, hopefully we can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=5245)|
| 1:27:34| have a good conversation about this issue, and I'd like to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=5254)|
| 1:27:41| move to item D, which is approving the suspension of policy B-200,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=5261)|
| 1:27:49| which would require the two readings of the board policy C-240 face coverings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=5269)|
| 1:27:56| allowing approval or denial of a revised policy on one reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=5276)|
| 1:28:00| Ms. Babb asked that these two items be added, so Ms. Babb, if you would like to speak to this, you're welcome to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=5280)|
| 1:28:12| Sure, and one thing I would like to say, and I think this sort of addresses what Ms. Horne has said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=5292)|
| 1:28:16| is we are a nine-person board, and we represent different parts of our community, and honestly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=5296)|
| 1:28:21| I think we've all represented our community, and it just kind of shows we are very divisive on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=5301)|
| 1:28:27| and I think that kind of has come about, and I mean, I think we all hear from our constituents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=5307)|
| 1:28:33| and we are trying to represent the constituents in our area, but at the end of the day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=5313)|
| 1:28:37| we have to come together about something. So what I am suggesting, and let me read what this says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=5317)|
| 1:28:45| basically, let me get to it, and I need my reading glasses, sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=5325)|
| 1:28:50| The face mask requirement will end on Wednesday, May 26th, and until August 1st, 2021,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=5330)|
| 1:28:58| the Knox County Schools will follow the current Tennessee Department of Health guidelines,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=5338)|
| 1:29:03| which state that masks are recommended but optional. So that is what I am putting forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=5343)|
| 1:29:10| Mr. Thomas sent this to us Thursday as his recommendation. I had had the same thoughts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=5350)|
| 1:29:16| I think this goes along with what our governor has recommended. He asked that we kind of get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=5356)|
| 1:29:23| rid of mask mandates by the end of May. I know that there are many different views on how we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=5363)|
| 1:29:32| should do this or should have done this before, but this is what I am putting forward now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=5372)|
| 1:29:36| and I know that I will let Ms. Owen speak, too. I think she maybe has some thoughts. Well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=5376)|
| 1:29:43| I will let Ms. Horne call on her, but Ms. Horne had some different thoughts to slightly clarify,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=5383)|
| 1:29:48| I think, what I had put forward. Ms. Owen did. I mean, I am sorry. Okay. Ms. Owen. Thank you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=5388)|
| 1:29:54| Ms. Babb. Thank you, and I am going to ask Mr. Dupler to help me with some of this language| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=5394)|
| 1:29:59| in just a minute. My suggestion is that instead of making this two different motions next week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=5399)|
| 1:30:04| that we make it one motion, and it would be a motion to suspend Policy B200 and waive the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=5404)|
| 1:30:10| second reading to amend Policy C240 with the following language. This policy shall sunset at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=5410)|
| 1:30:16| 5 p.m. on May 26 to be superseded by the Knox County Schools 2021-22 Opening Plan, which includes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=5416)|
| 1:30:25| flexibility for the Director of Schools to adjust face mask requirements based on public school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=5425)|
| 1:30:31| recommendations from the Tennessee Department of Health. And if Mr. Dupler could clarify| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=5431)|
| 1:30:37| what those recommendations are, I think that would be helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=5437)|
| 1:30:42| Thank you, Mr. Dupler. Thank you, Ms. Owen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=5442)|
| 1:30:47| Thank you, Madam Chair. Ms. Owen. So, the Tennessee Department of Health has issued| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=5447)|
| 1:30:53| recommendations for the management of COVID in schools. That was initially put out last year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=5453)|
| 1:31:03| 2020. The last real substantive update was March 29th of this year. There was an update in April,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=5463)|
| 1:31:14| April 6th, but that was a very minor, it says format changes. So, but this is the most current| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=5474)|
| 1:31:21| set of recommendations. And to Ms. Owen's point, I mean, what this set of recommendations says about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=5481)|
| 1:31:29| face coverings, masks, first it says overarching recommendations. It says the CDC recommends| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=5489)|
| 1:31:36| consistent and correct use of face masks in public settings around people who do not live in the same| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=5496)|
| 1:31:42| household, especially if difficult to maintain physical distancing. And then I'll read out of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=5502)|
| 1:31:51| student considerations first, and I'll go back to staffing, but under student considerations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=5511)|
| 1:31:58| universal and correct use of face masks by students, unless under age two, sleeping,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=5518)|
| 1:32:04| or unable to remove their face mask without assistance. And then you look under staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=5524)|
| 1:32:11| considerations, staffing considerations, universal and correct use of face masks should be required.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=5531)|
| 1:32:20| So, that's the current recommendations from the Tennessee Department of Health.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=5540)|
| 1:32:26| Thank you, Mr. Dupleur. Ms. Christie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=5546)|
| 1:32:32| Yeah, my preference, and well, first, let me tell you why. Vaccines are widely available now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=5552)|
| 1:32:40| And as we heard Dr. Child say, you know, vaccines are the end game. And I'm certainly not advocating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=5560)|
| 1:32:50| for mandatory vaccines. I'm just saying they are widely available for anyone who wants to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=5570)|
| 1:32:56| get one. And I feel like by August, everyone who wants one will have had the opportunity to receive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=5576)|
| 1:33:03| one. So, excuse me, you can sign up to speak at public forum next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=5583)|
| 1:33:09| I am, my preference would be to change the policy to the face mask requirement will end on Wednesday, May 26th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=5589)|
| 1:33:23| And just leave it at that. Okay, thank you, Ms. Christie. Ms. Bounds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=5603)|
| 1:33:30| Yeah, I would support ending it on May the 26th and leaving it like that. And maybe this needs to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=5610)|
| 1:33:39| wait until June. But I think that nothing has changed going forward. If we follow the Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=5619)|
| 1:33:49| Department of Health recommendations, unless they make a major update, which Mr. Dupleur has said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=5629)|
| 1:33:56| which Mr. Dupleur has said the last time was March the 29th, and we know what's changed since then,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=5636)|
| 1:34:02| then we're basically where we were this year. If I understand Mr. Dupleur correctly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=5642)|
| 1:34:08| teachers are wearing face masks, students are wearing face masks. And what was the other one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=5648)|
| 1:34:15| Children under two, which doesn't pertain to us particularly. But I don't see that anything's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=5655)|
| 1:34:21| changed with this. So I can support whatever tonight possibly, but I will be bringing something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=5661)|
| 1:34:28| to the board in June to revisit the superintendent's proposal that we voted on last time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=5668)|
| 1:34:37| Thank you, Ms. Bounds. Ms. Owen. Madam Chair, this may be a point of order. I would just like to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=5677)|
| 1:34:43| ask that if we're going to have people yelling out and interrupting our meetings that we do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=5683)|
| 1:34:48| ask them to leave. I don't want a repeat of what we've had before, and our staff shouldn't be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=5688)|
| 1:34:55| subjected to that. So if we are going to have people that refuse to follow our basic civility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=5695)|
| 1:35:03| that we go ahead and ask them to leave. Then the point of this change that I made| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=5703)|
| 1:35:12| is so that whatever the state health department does, this gives Superintendent Thomas the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=5712)|
| 1:35:20| flexibility to follow that without us having to rehash it all again. So if they changed everything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=5720)|
| 1:35:28| tomorrow and something else came out, he would have the ability to adjust as necessary so that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=5728)|
| 1:35:35| he could make those decisions. I think while we were in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=5735)|
| 1:35:44| a significant emergency situation, I think it's important that we had that policy to back up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=5744)|
| 1:35:50| everything that we were doing. But as we are moving forward, this is more of an administrative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=5750)|
| 1:35:58| issue, and I think it's important to return that to the administration. The dates that I had here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=5758)|
| 1:36:06| for the ending and the opening plan is so that this could also cover what we did last time so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=5766)|
| 1:36:13| that it would sort of roll back and take care of summer school so that we wouldn't have those two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=5773)|
| 1:36:17| months with nothing. So that's the goal there is to allow the director of schools to make those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=5777)|
| 1:36:26| adjustments as necessary based on the recommendations from the Tennessee Department of Health.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=5786)|
| 1:36:33| Thank you, Ms. Owen. Ms. Babb? I guess I want some clarification from Mr. Dupler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=5793)|
| 1:36:41| The way that it was written, and my understanding of the Tennessee Department of Health guidelines| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=5801)|
| 1:36:45| was that masks are recommended but not required, which I interpret to mean optional. Kind of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=5805)|
| 1:36:52| hearing the way you're reading it makes it sound like they're required, not recommended. Can you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=5812)|
| 1:36:58| And like I said, I might have missed some wording. So, Mr. Dupler? Thank you, Ms. Babb. Thank you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=5818)|
| 1:37:05| Madam Chair. So the word optional does not appear in the recommendations. However,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=5825)|
| 1:37:14| our office takes the position that these are recommendations. That's what they are. The| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=5834)|
| 1:37:21| governor has stated that there's never been a mask mandate in Tennessee. So, I mean, these are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=5841)|
| 1:37:29| truly recommendations. And the line that I read about the CDC, it says recommends. It doesn't say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=5849)|
| 1:37:38| mandate. The line that I read about student considerations, it's a consideration, not a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=5858)|
| 1:37:47| mandate. Same with the staffing. It says staffing considerations, not a mandate. Now, probably the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=5867)|
| 1:37:55| most, probably the strongest language is around the staffing, but it says should be required. It| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=5875)|
| 1:38:01| says universal and correct use of face masks should be required. It doesn't say must, doesn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=5881)|
| 1:38:07| say will. So, I apologize if there's any type of misunderstanding, but this language does not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=5887)|
| 1:38:14| require a mandate. Thank you, Mr. Dupler. Does that answer your question, Ms. Babb? Yes, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=5894)|
| 1:38:21| So, we feel like the wording of Tennessee Department of Health guidelines is recommended,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=5901)|
| 1:38:27| but optional, is in line with the health department for right now. Like, I mean, we all realize since| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=5907)|
| 1:38:32| they have health department, I mean, as I keep telling people, a year ago, none of us ever saw| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=5912)|
| 1:38:39| any of this coming. I can, none of us can predict what August is. We're all hoping it just gets| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=5919)|
| 1:38:43| better and better and better, but right now, we're following it. We can go along with kind of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=5923)|
| 1:38:47| recommended, but optional is the way we're interpreting it. Is that incorrect?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=5927)|
| 1:38:55| So, I guess my question would be, if this is the verbiage, would your intent be, what would the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=5935)|
| 1:39:01| intent be then for August 1st? Because this is a recommendation, it's not a, it's not a mandate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=5941)|
| 1:39:08| Right, and actually, what I'm hoping, unless the Tennessee Department of Education,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=5948)|
| 1:39:14| Tennessee Department of Health changes things, if I'm interpreting it right, come August 1,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=5954)|
| 1:39:20| and when we start school, it would also be a recommended, but optional, which pretty much is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=5960)|
| 1:39:26| then people could decide if they wanted to wear a mask, they could wear a mask. If they didn't want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=5966)|
| 1:39:29| to wear a mask, they didn't have to wear a mask, unless the Tennessee Health Department came out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=5969)|
| 1:39:34| with stronger language mandating it, or the governor. I mean, there could be another emergency| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=5974)|
| 1:39:38| order, something like that. I mean, what I was hoping was, we could go forth, unless something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=5978)|
| 1:39:46| changes in the future, that it is a recommended, but optional, and I'm just not sure. That's what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=5986)|
| 1:39:53| I was hoping for, but I'm not sure. Okay. I don't know that we're all interpreting it the same way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=5993)|
| 1:39:57| Actually, Mr. Watson may have been first, and then Ms. Bounds. I think Mr. Watson was first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=5997)|
| 1:40:03| Thank you, Madam Chair. So, I'm frankly kind of surprised that the Tennessee Department of Health| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=6003)|
| 1:40:09| has not come out with new recommendations since the governor made his statement. I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=6009)|
| 1:40:13| to have them on March 29th, I know that there's been some press releases and press conferences| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=6013)|
| 1:40:18| and things like that. I don't think as a body, any of us want to make policy based on press| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=6018)|
| 1:40:22| conferences. That's probably not a good strategy, and the point that we talked about three weeks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=6022)|
| 1:40:31| ago, and I know a point that I was elevating, is that whatever the body, this body ends up doing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=6031)|
| 1:40:37| I think it's really important for the public to know who is it that we're going to for guidance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=6037)|
| 1:40:42| and the vote that we had three weeks ago was a 5-4 vote for following the superintendent's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=6042)|
| 1:40:51| recommendations for the 21-22 school year, which essentially says the exact same thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=6051)|
| 1:40:56| as Ms. Owens' recommendation, that we would follow the Tennessee Department of Health guidelines,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=6056)|
| 1:41:01| no matter what they say, as they changed, and the superintendent and his team would have the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=6061)|
| 1:41:05| ability to adjust. We also, at a 9-0 vote, approved sunsetting the policy August 1,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=6065)|
| 1:41:14| and I think the reason that happened at that point, if I'm remembering correctly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=6074)|
| 1:41:19| is because we did talk about, as Ms. Owens said, if we sunset it earlier, what happens| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=6079)|
| 1:41:24| in that two-month window where we still have kids going to school, and so I think the attempt| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=6084)|
| 1:41:30| here that Ms. Owens is making is basically keeping the same decision we made three weeks ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=6090)|
| 1:41:36| we're just advancing it. We're just saying, let's take the line where the two things connect,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=6096)|
| 1:41:41| the policy ending and the recommendation starting, and let's just advance it forward two months,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=6101)|
| 1:41:47| and frankly, I can say that I can get in favor of that. The whole reason I didn't want to do May| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=6107)|
| 1:41:52| three weeks ago is because I thought it was not fair to our parents and to our families and to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=6112)|
| 1:41:58| the public to have this really ambiguous two- or three-month period in the summer. I do think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=6118)|
| 1:42:05| it's important, Ms. Babb, to dig into that conversation about recommended or optional.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=6125)|
| 1:42:09| As far as I know, anything that I've read in the CDC or the Tennessee Department of Health,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=6129)|
| 1:42:14| that all of those are basically recommendations. The CDC does not mandate specific actions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=6134)|
| 1:42:22| and the Tennessee Department of Health, I don't think, is going to mandate specific actions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=6142)|
| 1:42:26| and so if we take the word recommended and make it synonymous with optional,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=6146)|
| 1:42:31| then basically everything we just did this past year, we did as an option, and I don't know that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=6151)|
| 1:42:37| that was the intent of the superintendent when he made his plan last year, so instead of saying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=6157)|
| 1:42:44| recommended but optional, I would say, let's stick with recommended because that's what it actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=6164)|
| 1:42:49| says, and then let's do it in the same way we've been doing it, which is if it's been recommended| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=6169)|
| 1:42:55| by that body, then we adhere to it, so I can be supportive of the way that Ms. Owen has framed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=6175)|
| 1:43:02| the language, and I also thought this was interesting. I don't know if all the board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=6182)|
| 1:43:07| members have had a chance to look at it yet, but the TSBA, which is the Tennessee School Board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=6187)|
| 1:43:12| Association, did a survey. Actually, the day the governor made his announcement, or the day after| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=6192)|
| 1:43:17| the governor made his announcement, I can't remember quite when, but if you haven't had a chance to look at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=6197)|
| 1:43:21| that yet, so they call it mask mandates, which is not the right language, but we have 95| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=6201)|
| 1:43:27| counties in the state of Tennessee, for those who aren't fully aware of that. 69 of them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=6207)|
| 1:43:33| so 73 percent, have had some form of mask mandate in schools since, you know, since COVID. Since the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=6213)|
| 1:43:41| governor's announcement, 23 of them or 24 percent of them said they were going to review whatever| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=6221)|
| 1:43:49| that whatever their current mandate was, and then I thought this was interesting. 53 of them, 56| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=6229)|
| 1:43:56| percent of them said we intend to keep whatever version of our current mandate we have related| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=6236)|
| 1:44:02| to masks through the end of the school year, so I think that's, again, I think it falls in line| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=6242)|
| 1:44:08| with what Ms. Favre said and kind of where the governor's at and others is that let's not make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=6248)|
| 1:44:13| any change before the end of the school year. I mean, it seems like that's even where the majority| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=6253)|
| 1:44:18| of counties are doing across the state of Tennessee, and I think that's really interesting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=6258)|
| 1:44:22| given that outside of the six counties that have their own health departments, it's really up to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=6262)|

| 1:44:32| what we're doing through the end of the school year, even with the governor's comments, so I don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=6272)|

| 1:44:42| I'm really only, I'm really only stating this again because a number of people emailed me and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=6282)|
| 1:44:47| felt bad that they weren't included on my spreadsheet last time, and so I promised them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=6287)|
| 1:44:51| that they would be included, so since the time, since this past Friday, I've gotten another 60| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=6291)|
| 1:44:58| emails, so it's 393 total since two days before that Friday meeting, and the number did| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=6298)|
| 1:45:05| decrease a little bit in terms of those who were in favor of masks. It's now 67 percent said that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=6305)|
| 1:45:10| they would prefer us to continue to keep masks through the end of the year, where I think it was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=6310)|
| 1:45:14| 73 percent on Friday, so for whatever that's worth, some people want to make memes of my spreadsheets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=6314)|
| 1:45:22| Thank you, Mr. Watson. Okay, Ms. Bounds. Thank you. What I understand, and Mr. Duport, you can correct| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=6322)|
| 1:45:30| me if I'm wrong, we've heard that school boards have the power to decide whether to mask or unmask,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=6330)|
| 1:45:37| and according to Tennessee code annotated, the board has one employee, and that's the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=6337)|
| 1:45:43| superintendent of schools, so this board could follow the governor and the mayor's recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=6343)|
| 1:45:52| and vote to direct the superintendent for the children to be mask free for 21 and 22. Is that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=6352)|
| 1:46:01| accurate, Mr. Duport? Mr. Duport? Thank you, Madam Chair. Thank you, Ms. Bounds. Yes, that's accurate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=6361)|
| 1:46:10| Okay, thank you. So, like I said, I will be bringing back something to this board in June| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=6370)|
| 1:46:16| if the action is not taken next week. For now, I am perfectly fine in supporting Ms. Christie's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=6376)|
| 1:46:23| initiative to end this on May 26th period, and that's what I will support on the voting meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=6383)|
| 1:46:32| but I do think we have to be, I think there's too much confusion out there in the public,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=6392)|
| 1:46:40| I mean, I was confused, optional, recommended, and I think that we're recommended, leaves open the door| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=6400)|
| 1:46:48| for this, if we follow the Tennessee Department of Health's recommendations next year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=6408)|
| 1:46:54| that our school year will look just like this school year, and I think that's very unfair| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=6414)|
| 1:47:00| to the children of Knox County when, and I know you all get tired of hearing my illustrations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=6420)|
| 1:47:06| but it's very true. I think I put it away now, it's not up on my phone. Several weeks ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=6426)|
| 1:47:13| y'all heard about my baseball experience? Well, I had a soccer experience, and I went to a city-owned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=6433)|
| 1:47:19| park with eight fields. Every field was filled with players, parents, grandparents, at least 400| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=6439)|
| 1:47:29| cars in the parking lot, so if you take those 400 cars and multiply those by players and parents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=6449)|
| 1:47:36| you're looking at a very large crowd, not one mass. This past weekend, I traveled to a softball| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=6456)|
| 1:47:43| tournament in, where did we go? Yeah, another city, and those people playing in that tournament,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=6463)|
| 1:47:52| there were 49 teams from all over the area and out of state, not one mask in the entire park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=6472)|
| 1:48:01| so I understand that we're inside a building, but I still, with the numbers and everything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=6481)|
| 1:48:07| that's happening, I do not understand why our children are still wearing masks for next year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=6487)|
| 1:48:12| so anyway, I support Ms. Christie. I'll let somebody else have the floor, but I will bring something back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=6492)|
| 1:48:18| to this board to reconsider in June. Thank you, Ms. Bounds. We'll go to Ms. Hatterfield.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=6498)|
| 1:48:23| Thank you, Madam Chair. As for this particular decision, the Board of Education made a decision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=6503)|
| 1:48:29| on April 14th. The only thing that changed from then to now are the decisions that were made| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=6509)|
| 1:48:35| from the governor and the mayor. It's been stated many times that Knox County School Board and the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=6515)|
| 1:48:40| superintendent makes the decision for Knox County Schools. I think we're moving into dangerous| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=6520)|
| 1:48:44| territory by letting governing bodies influence and possibly dictate how we run Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=6524)|
| 1:48:50| Schools, so I do feel like this will pass and that's what it will be, but my vote will be a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=6530)|
| 1:48:55| constant reminder to not undermine the Board of Education, so I will not support this for that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=6535)|
| 1:49:01| reason. Thank you, Ms. Hatterfield. Ms. Henderson. I just want to say I also support Ms. Christie's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=6541)|
| 1:49:08| recommendation of just the language of ending it on Wednesday, May 26th. That way there's no| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=6548)|
| 1:49:14| confusion. I read it a few times, too, and every time I could read it differently or interpret it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=6554)|
| 1:49:19| differently, so I think that way it eliminates the confusion and moves us forward to normalcy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=6559)|
| 1:49:27| Thank you, Ms. Henderson. Ms. Hatterfield. Okay, thank you. Okay, and I too would support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=6567)|
| 1:49:36| Ms. Christie if you bring an alternate motion for the 26th. I think that would just be less| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=6576)|

| 1:57:15| prior to Friday's meeting where the agenda failed to pass and I chose to come back today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=7035)|
| 1:57:20| because I feared some not so friendly amendments being made to alter what was on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=7040)|
| 1:57:26| I come to you to discuss two of those items. First, there's an item on the agenda to suspend| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=7046)|
| 1:57:31| rules and waive first reading of the proposal to come before the board. I ask that you take a moment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=7051)|

| 1:58:04| two readings of the proposal before the school year begins next year. Second is the issue many| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=7084)|
| 1:58:09| want to discuss. Should masks be required in public schools in Knox County? This issue goes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=7089)|
| 1:58:16| beyond whether or not you believe masks work or not. Armchair researchers can find information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=7096)|

| 2:00:31| presents one more challenge. I have been assured that students and staff can certainly wear a mask| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=7231)|
| 2:00:36| if they are more comfortable with one. However, the possibility of mass bullying does not exist| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=7236)|

| 2:04:34| Recently this board voted to allow the current mask policy to sunset at a significantly later| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=7474)|

| 2:04:44| monitor the local situation and allow more people in the community, teachers especially,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=7484)|

| 2:04:52| once this policy sunsets the district would follow the more nimble and current health agency guidance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=7492)|
| 2:04:58| and recommendations. Let me immediately point out that if you were to sunset this policy at this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=7498)|

| 2:05:36| articulated plan in place. Along those lines the amendment under discussion tonight potentially| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=7536)|
| 2:05:42| makes a significant omission and error in addition to generating new policy by effectively ending| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=7542)|
| 2:05:48| another. On the latter point this board sets policies of their own and any positive recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=7548)|
| 2:05:53| that is made should be addressed debated and voted on separately by the board not legislated by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=7553)|

| 2:06:03| More importantly the language of the amendment is both imprecise and possibly incorrect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=7563)|
| 2:06:09| First the amendment references state health policy without citing it and I think any local policy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=7569)|
| 2:06:14| decision of this magnitude cannot leave this to guesswork. It then does something more problematic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=7574)|
| 2:06:19| in potentially putting words in the mouth of the state's guidelines by saying that masks are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=7579)|
| 2:06:24| optional and I'm sorry to reiterate some of these points. Not only does this exact language not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=7584)|
| 2:06:29| appear anywhere in the most recent guidelines from the state but it is a potential misrepresentation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=7589)|
| 2:06:34| of standard health policy recommendations which this body at their last vote did agree to still| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=7594)|

| 2:06:44| recommendations of the states and the CDC's guidelines. In other words this body has not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=7604)|
| 2:06:48| only agreed to follow these recommendations but there is precedent for the board to implement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=7608)|
| 2:06:52| them and interpret them as non-optional. Optional implies that there are no consequences for not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=7612)|

| 2:07:25| justification for doing so. The state the CDC and our local experts will all tell you on the basis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=7645)|

| 2:12:25| The most recent is Anthony Thompson Jr.'s tragic killing at Austin East. From what we have learned we know that he was distressed. So why didn't the officers use crisis intervention techniques.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=7945)|
| 2:12:42| They had options to de-escalate and disarm the situation. Instead the situation escalated and we know ended tragically with his death.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=7962)|
| 2:12:56| In another incident earlier in the year a former special ed student of mine with autism was agitated and reached a high level of crisis in school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=7976)|
| 2:13:07| The school KPD officer intervened and my former student ended up getting handcuffed, was told he was going to jail, was dragged down the hallway on his belly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=7987)|

| 2:13:29| Instead of de-escalating the situation escalated. I taught art to both of these students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=8009)|

| 2:14:04| My understanding is the current MOA that this board approved in July 2019 instructs administrators, school principals and school staff members to defer to KPD and KCSO officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=8044)|
| 2:14:20| In the agreement the board essentially abdicates control over which officers are assigned to our schools, how they are trained and actions they take.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=8060)|
| 2:14:31| My question to the board is, is this true? I don't even actually know if this is actually true. I'm trying to find out. And if this is true, are you okay with this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=8071)|
| 2:14:42| It is time KCS reviews the MOA to ensure that every officer who enters school property is trained and certified to work with children, especially children in crisis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=8082)|
| 2:14:54| This is a start. But really, KCS needs to put a more solid foundation in place that can prevent traumatic and tragic incidents from happening in the first place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=8094)|
| 2:15:05| Young people experience distress. Young people experience crisis and the problem is not going away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=8105)|
| 2:15:13| At my school we've had multiple trainings on trauma, but we need to look at the big picture and create a trauma-informed school system that prioritizes the social and emotional needs of our students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=8113)|
| 2:15:25| And it has to be at all levels. Policies that the school board, central office and elected officials pass need to be trauma-informed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=8125)|
| 2:15:34| So I look forward to seeing how the discussion of reviewing the MOA unfolds and participating in the process. Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=8134)|

| 2:17:37| That is irresponsible and dangerous for those officers not to have set guidelines from the school system when things like this happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=8257)|

| 2:17:55| When we watched the video and we watched it and my son being dragged down the hallway by that officer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=8275)|
| 2:18:01| we asked school security, who is separate from KPD, if their school officers would be allowed to do that same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=8281)|
| 2:18:08| We were told that Knox County school security is not allowed to restrain a special needs child in any way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=8288)|

| 2:19:57| Since I began teaching, I have been uncomfortable with the presence of police at schools, and I hope to communicate why tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=8397)|
| 2:20:04| Part of this discomfort has come from my own observations when I have sometimes seen officers wielding power over students in inappropriate ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=8404)|
| 2:20:12| I have seen school resource officers make fun of and belittle students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=8412)|
| 2:20:16| I have seen officers watching videos on their phones of fights between students and laughing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=8416)|
| 2:20:21| I have seen a student, I teach a journalism class and this student was requesting an interview with an officer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=8421)|
| 2:20:28| who accepted the request for an interview only to give joking and bogus answers to belittle the student and befuddle them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=8428)|
| 2:20:35| Admittedly, teachers also don't always treat students with respect either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=8435)|
| 2:20:40| But teachers do not do so with weapons at their hips, nor the weight of law enforcement behind them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=8440)|
| 2:20:47| With the police, the power dynamic between officers and students is far more lopsided, to a degree that I think needs to give us great pause.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=8447)|
| 2:20:54| On an even more serious note, I have seen students apprehended and arrested for non-violent behavior,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=8454)|
| 2:21:00| and I have seen officers present during disciplinary actions that did not result in arrests.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=8460)|
| 2:21:05| These are rare occurrences, but they loom large in the collective imagination of students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=8465)|
| 2:21:09| Again, I come back to that gun and the power of law enforcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=8469)|
| 2:21:12| The presence of officers at schools is a promise of arrests, of the possibility of that gun going off, however seldom that occurs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=8472)|
| 2:21:21| Why, after all, do we have officers in our schools?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=8481)|
| 2:21:24| It's not to simply befriend students, to help with bus boarding, or to watch security footage, because anyone can do those things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=8484)|
| 2:21:30| The unique set of skills and possibilities that a law enforcement officer specifically brings to a school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=8490)|
| 2:21:35| is that officer's legal ability to arrest, apprehend, and use force.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=8495)|
| 2:21:39| I am not saying that all SROs have malicious intentions in their interactions with students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=8499)|
| 2:21:44| I have to assume that most, if not all of them, are in the unglamorous role of being a school officer because they care for others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=8504)|
| 2:21:51| Nor am I saying that everything that these officers do is harmful, because it's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=8511)|
| 2:21:56| But what I am saying is that the intentions and moral character of individual officers do not change the intimidating effect that the presence of officers can have on some students,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=8516)|
| 2:22:04| nor do individual actions change the purpose of these officers at schools, to arrest and to enact violence when deemed necessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=8524)|
| 2:22:11| I realize that for some, these officers' abilities are comforting, but we have to recognize, as others have shared tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=8531)|
| 2:22:17| that for others, the sight of an officer or the idea of an officer arresting or using force is unnerving and even frightening,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=8537)|
| 2:22:23| and that the reasons why some might feel this way about officers are valid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=8543)|
| 2:22:27| Some may feel uncomfortable at the presence of a loaded firearm in a school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=8547)|
| 2:22:31| Others may have seen parents or loved ones arrested by the police.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=8551)|
| 2:22:34| Others may have seen police detain family members and, as a result, have the process of deportation initiated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=8554)|
| 2:22:39| Students of color may have been profiled, or have seen others profiled, and others may have experienced brutality from the police.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=8559)|
| 2:22:46| Still others, as we have heard from tonight, have experienced this within schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=8566)|
| 2:22:50| and the presence of officers in schools means that these experiences are not just baggage that students bring to schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=8570)|
| 2:22:56| but baggage that we allow to occur within our schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=8576)|
| 2:23:00| Placing officers in schools means that we are tacitly accepting the possibility that an officer may arrest or use force on someone inside a school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=8580)|
| 2:23:08| and this isn't just an idle hypothetical, as we, of course, all know last month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=8588)|
| 2:23:12| an officer, not all of whom were designated school officers, but one of whom was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=8592)|
| 2:23:18| were involved in killing a student at Knox County High School, and would anyone blame| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=8598)|
| 2:23:22| any student at Austin East for being afraid of officers at their school after that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=8602)|
| 2:23:26| When students are afraid or intimidated or at risk of being arrested or even shot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=8606)|
| 2:23:31| how can we expect them to commit themselves to learning?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=8611)|
| 2:23:33| The safety and comfort of the students in our schools should be one of our highest priorities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=8613)|
| 2:23:38| but what I hope I have conveyed tonight is that the presence of law enforcement does not communicate safety and security to everyone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=8618)|
| 2:23:45| which is why I think it is important that we allow everyone impacted to have a voice in how our schools are kept safe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=8625)|
| 2:23:50| I don't come here claiming to have answers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=8630)|
| 2:23:52| Keeping our schools safe is a complicated problem that, as far as I know, has not been solved by anyone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=8632)|
| 2:23:58| and as I said minutes ago, I can't speak for anyone but myself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=8638)|
| 2:24:01| but I would say that neither can Knox County Schools claim to speak for everyone in the community either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=8641)|
| 2:24:06| As the current agreement with Knox County Sheriff's Office, as well as Knoxville Police Department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=8646)|
| 2:24:10| was agreed upon without comprehensive community engagement, we need to let the community speak for itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=8650)|
| 2:24:16| And as someone who teaches within District 8, I can also say that just the average opinions of the board representing my district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=8656)|
| 2:24:25| are not necessarily representative of the emails that I have sent to the people who represent the district that I teach in either,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=8665)|
| 2:24:32| which is why we need open meetings as opposed to just general vibes gathered from emails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=8672)|
| 2:24:37| Please vote for this resolution next week, and thank you for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=8677)|
| 2:24:42| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=8682)|

| 2:25:02| I'm Reverend Gordon Gibson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=8702)|
| 2:25:04| I'm a Knox County resident.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=8704)|
| 2:25:06| I live in the Park Ridge community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=8706)|
| 2:25:08| Actually, in the former Park Junior High.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=8708)|
| 2:25:10| I'm here today to speak strongly in favor of the intent of the resolution brought by Mr. Watson and Ms. Satterfield.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=8710)|
| 2:25:22| Two years ago, I was one of the citizens who spoke and emailed to the board as the current MOA was under consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=8722)|
| 2:25:34| Among the specific suggestions that I made to the board was that the MOA should specify that SROs are to support and not supersede the directions of principals, teachers, etc.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=8734)|
| 2:26:05| That they were to be trained in how to de-escalate, to understand PBIS and restorative practices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=8765)|
| 2:26:19| I also remember at that meeting a relatively new board member named Satterfield brought a resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=8779)|
| 2:26:31| that no student would be handcuffed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=8791)|
| 2:26:35| It was suggested, oh, that would be more properly dealt with as a policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=8795)|
| 2:26:45| And the response to our suggestions, crickets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=8805)|
| 2:26:57| Let me tell you a story.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=8817)|
| 2:26:59| About my granddaughter's high school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=8819)|
| 2:27:05| One day, the principal, others in the school office, witnessed a shooting outside the school on the sidewalk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=8825)|
| 2:27:17| They put the school on lockdown, keep students and staff safe, called 911,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=8837)|
| 2:27:26| and the principal went to the entrance, knowing that police would be arriving soon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=8846)|
| 2:27:36| Police did indeed arrive, fully armed, ready for action, ready to come in the school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=8856)|
| 2:27:48| The principal, an Asian American woman of relatively short stature, said, no, you are not coming in my school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=8868)|
| 2:28:00| The shooting was on the sidewalk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=8880)|
| 2:28:04| The shooter went that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=8884)|
| 2:28:08| If you want the shooter, you go that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=8888)|
| 2:28:12| You will not come in my building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=8892)|
| 2:28:16| And terrify my students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=8896)|
| 2:28:20| Brandishing weapons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=8900)|
| 2:28:26| She made her point stick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=8906)|
| 2:28:30| I don't need to tell you that high school was not in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=8910)|
| 2:28:38| It was not operating under the MOA that we have now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=8918)|
| 2:28:45| It was in San Francisco, California.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=8925)|
| 2:28:51| That action, by that principal, protecting those students, is unimaginable under our current MOA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=8931)|
| 2:29:05| I want it to become imaginable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=8945)|
| 2:29:11| I want it to become expectable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=8951)|
| 2:29:17| I encourage you to have the conversation that I heard all of you commit to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=8957)|
| 2:29:23| I urge you to use outside facilitation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=8963)|
| 2:29:29| I urge you to appropriate money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=8969)|
| 2:29:33| To bring in outside expertise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=8973)|
| 2:29:37| I urge you, involve us in the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=8977)|
| 2:29:41| We have opinions and experiences that need to be included.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=8981)|
| 2:29:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=8987)|
| 2:29:49| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=8989)|

| 2:29:55| You'll state your name and county of residence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=8995)|
| 2:30:00| My name is Kristen Hancock and I live in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=9000)|
| 2:30:08| I'm a parent of two young boys that are in the Knox County schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=9008)|
| 2:30:14| Today, I actually wanted to address the mask policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=9014)|
| 2:30:20| But, I do want to actually speak as well on this topic of security and law enforcement within the school system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=9020)|
| 2:30:28| I think that any of our policy makers and law makers, more importantly, over anything, anybody's opinion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=9028)|
| 2:30:38| I think that you guys should understand the job of an officer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=9038)|
| 2:30:42| And most agencies, or many, I wouldn't say most, but many agencies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=9042)|
| 2:30:46| offer what they call citizen police academies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=9046)|
| 2:30:50| And I believe that at some point they have done them with some of the agencies here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=9050)|
| 2:30:56| I know this personally from the state of Alabama.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=9056)|
| 2:31:00| But, I think that when you understand what an officer does,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=9060)|
| 2:31:04| what their job is, what they have to face,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=9064)|
| 2:31:08| I think that you can better serve your constituents because you're able to educate them a little more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=9068)|
| 2:31:12| on some of the things that they may have concerns on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=9072)|
| 2:31:16| that they also don't understand what these officers' jobs are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=9076)|
| 2:31:20| If you're going to make policies, you need to know what they're facing as officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=9080)|
| 2:31:25| And we need to be offering them as much support as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=9085)|
| 2:31:29| Asking them what equipment they need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=9089)|
| 2:31:31| Is there anything that we can do to make your job easier?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=9091)|
| 2:31:35| Please respect our speakers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=9095)|
| 2:31:37| Because I think that when we have that understanding, we can start to address| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=9097)|
| 2:31:41| the other issues and concerns of people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=9101)|
| 2:31:45| But that is so important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=9105)|
| 2:31:47| I think that every one of you should want to know and understand a police officer's job| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=9107)|
| 2:31:51| and inquire with the agencies here on a training program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=9111)|
| 2:31:55| like Citizens Police Academy that gives you a real in-depth understanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=9115)|
| 2:31:59| They can be short. They can be a week or two weeks long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=9119)|
| 2:32:03| After normal business hours, there's many ways that they do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=9123)|
| 2:32:07| But, I think that that would help in a lot of ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=9127)|
| 2:32:11| Our officers, they're there to protect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=9131)|
| 2:32:15| The best policing is being seen. Their presence needs to be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=9135)|
| 2:32:19| Because you have no idea how many crimes have been avoided| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=9139)|
| 2:32:23| because of their presence just being there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=9143)|
| 2:32:27| But I think that we also need to understand that this is about the relationship| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=9147)|
| 2:32:31| between the officers and the students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=9151)|
| 2:32:35| They're in the schools because we have students, we have situations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=9155)|
| 2:32:39| crisis situations that happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=9159)|
| 2:32:43| And we need to understand that that relationship is between them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=9163)|
| 2:32:47| and not the outside. Because I think that there's a lot of groups,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=9167)|
| 2:32:51| a lot of people with different motives, a lot of people that want to complain,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=9171)|
| 2:32:55| they want to talk about police this, police that, and everything they do wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=9175)|
| 2:32:59| But we're not addressing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=9179)|
| 2:33:03| Okay, let's see what this relationship is like with these officers in the schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=9183)|
| 2:33:07| because these officers do make a difference in these kids' lives and I think if we stop all the noise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=9187)|
| 2:33:11| from outside, we can actually learn more about what they are doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=9191)|
| 2:33:15| that is good and positive and where we can help them and support them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=9195)|
| 2:33:19| in their efforts to make a difference in these kids' lives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=9199)|
| 2:33:23| Because they do develop relationships with kids and they do help them and they are an advocate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=9203)|
| 2:33:27| for them and a lot of times these kids are being told at home that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=9207)|
| 2:33:31| police are bad, you can't trust them, they're out to get you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=9211)|
| 2:33:35| they're all liars, they're all out to frame you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=9215)|
| 2:33:39| There's all kinds of things that these kids hear from their home| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=9219)|
| 2:33:43| and they also hear stories from family members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=9223)|
| 2:33:47| and that really influences their behavior too in the presence of an officer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=9227)|
| 2:33:51| because they're having this outside influence and they're being taught all these things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=9231)|
| 2:33:55| and in reality these children need to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=9235)|
| 2:33:59| know that they can trust these officers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=9239)|
| 2:34:03| and I will say another thing that officers have to act in a split second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=9243)|
| 2:34:07| They have a split second. Their job is to stop a threat if there is a threat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=9247)|
| 2:34:11| And I think that we have to understand the bigger picture| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=9251)|
| 2:34:15| and what that job is. Although they have to do a lot of things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=9255)|
| 2:34:19| they have to pull a lot of tools out of their box, they have to be a counselor sometimes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=9259)|
| 2:34:23| they have to be a rescue personnel, they have to help with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=9263)|
| 2:34:27| a medical situation. There are a lot of things, but when it comes down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=9267)|
| 2:34:31| to it, they're not psychologists. Their job is to protect and to serve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=9271)|
| 2:34:35| and if there are resources that these families are asking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=9275)|
| 2:34:39| for that they need, especially hearing stories about people who have been traumatized| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=9279)|
| 2:34:43| because their child has been traumatized seeing something, this is something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=9283)|
| 2:34:47| that can be addressed with the psychologist that we have in our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=9287)|
| 2:34:51| schools. I do know that there is a program that can help on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=9291)|
| 2:34:55| this counseling side because students may have deeper issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=9295)|
| 2:34:59| Officers can't be expected to have to address these more in-depth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=9299)|
| 2:35:03| issues. They're there with training that is to protect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=9303)|
| 2:35:07| and emotional well-being is important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=9307)|
| 2:35:11| We have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=9311)|
| 2:35:15| talked about this. We are here to respect every single| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=9315)|
| 2:35:19| person that comes to speak. People have different opinions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=9319)|
| 2:35:31| Please respect everyone that speaks. We as a board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=9331)|
| 2:35:35| respect them and we expect you to also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=9335)|

| 2:35:55| I've approached all of you before. You've seen me before. You've heard me before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=9355)|
| 2:35:59| You've heard my kids speak as well. I asked them tonight if they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=9359)|
| 2:36:03| wanted to speak again and honestly they've both said we've spoken| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=9363)|
| 2:36:07| before and they don't listen. That's their perspective as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=9367)|
| 2:36:11| teenagers so I let them stay home this evening but I just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=9371)|
| 2:36:15| wanted to mention something. I have emailed all of you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=9375)|
| 2:36:19| regarding plans for the upcoming graduation ceremonies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=9379)|
| 2:36:23| I appreciate those of you who took the time to respond about your concerns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=9383)|
| 2:36:27| and bringing the attention of this to the board and those who| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=9387)|
| 2:36:31| are making decisions. I pray that as you deliberate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=9391)|
| 2:36:35| what to do with the face covering policy that you think about the upcoming graduation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=9395)|
| 2:36:39| ceremonies. We've talked before about the fact that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=9399)|
| 2:36:43| the policies should be different for outside with distancing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=9403)|
| 2:36:47| and I still think that it's still| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=9407)|
| 2:36:51| up to interpretation. It sounds like in different schools and different| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=9411)|
| 2:36:55| administrations but as far as the graduates go at least at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=9415)|
| 2:36:59| our high school, last year they were well distanced on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=9419)|
| 2:37:03| football field. I believe that it's going to be the same process again| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=9423)|
| 2:37:07| for them this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=9427)|
| 2:37:11| My daughter who's a senior who is the graduate, she is a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=9431)|
| 2:37:15| madrigal. The madrigals are planning to sing at the high school graduation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=9435)|
| 2:37:19| That's kind of a tradition and right now they'll be masked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=9439)|
| 2:37:23| again on the field outside as they have been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=9443)|
| 2:37:27| for their whole singing career this senior year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=9447)|
| 2:37:31| I would like for our seniors personally to have one last| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=9451)|
| 2:37:35| opportunity this year to be unmasked on their school property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=9455)|
| 2:37:39| and so I would just like everyone to think about that when the decision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=9459)|
| 2:37:43| is made regarding the masks, face coverings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=9463)|
| 2:37:47| I would also respectfully ask that whatever decision is made| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=9467)|
| 2:37:51| regarding the face coverings and quite frankly all other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=9471)|
| 2:37:55| activities such as the contact tracing, quarantining, whatever the policies will be going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=9475)|
| 2:37:59| forward for the 2021-22 school year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=9479)|
| 2:38:03| That the policies verbiage cannot be left up to interpretation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=9483)|
| 2:38:07| That it must be clear and concise language so that all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=9487)|
| 2:38:11| principals and admin teams will be doing the same thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=9491)|
| 2:38:15| across the county and the schools. It's still as I mentioned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=9495)|
| 2:38:19| before as far as the outdoors, masking outdoors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=9499)|
| 2:38:23| everybody's doing something different and I think that that's unfair| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=9503)|
| 2:38:27| to the students across the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=9507)|
| 2:38:31| Lastly, I'm just going to make some comments. These were from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=9511)|
| 2:38:35| friends of mine when I asked, what do you want me to say to the board if you can't come?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=9515)|
| 2:38:39| Take off masks. Make masks optional.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=9519)|
| 2:38:43| Please no more mask requirements. Make them optional.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=9523)|
| 2:38:47| Masks off. Optional for those who want them but not mandatory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=9527)|
| 2:38:51| Look how masks have created a divide in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=9531)|
| 2:38:55| Allow people to make decisions for their own children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=9535)|
| 2:38:59| What is the rationale for why some do not trust parents to parent their own children?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=9539)|
| 2:39:03| I think there is no reason for masking children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=9543)|
| 2:39:07| Masks off. Make it optional. End of discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=9547)|
| 2:39:11| Say no to masks. They are too hard on special needs kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=9551)|
| 2:39:15| Many special needs elementary students who have worked hard on social, emotional| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=9555)|
| 2:39:19| and communication skills have had many declines this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=9559)|
| 2:39:23| Masks have made many students feel more disconnected and the feelings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=9563)|
| 2:39:27| of others are harder to interpret or anticipate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=9567)|
| 2:39:31| Optional because if you follow the science, the rate of death for this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=9571)|
| 2:39:35| age group in Knoxville is 0%. Masking should be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=9575)|
| 2:39:39| optional. Period. I appreciate all of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=9579)|
| 2:39:43| I know that everything that you have to deal with on a daily basis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=9583)|
| 2:39:47| outside of just preparing for these meetings is a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=9587)|
| 2:39:51| And I respect each of you and your positions. I didn't have the opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=9591)|
| 2:39:55| to vote for any person, my own board member.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=9595)|
| 2:39:59| I was not a U.S. citizen during the last election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=9599)|
| 2:40:03| And I am now. And this whole process and this whole year has changed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=9603)|

| 2:40:11| isn't important. And I feel like my vote now as a U.S. citizen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=9611)|
| 2:40:15| is more important than ever. And so I hope that everybody who votes for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=9615)|

| 2:40:23| take your opportunity to take a vote and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=9623)|

| 2:41:03| offer a little clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=9663)|
| 2:41:07| And I work with the Knox County Education Coalition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=9667)|
| 2:41:11| And some things that there's been confusion about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=9671)|
| 2:41:15| the letter that the coalition sent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=9675)|
| 2:41:19| called for removal of KCSO| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=9679)|
| 2:41:23| and KPD officers until we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=9683)|
| 2:41:27| policies and procedures in place that put them under| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=9687)|
| 2:41:31| clear control of the school system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=9691)|
| 2:41:35| It was not a call for them to be removed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=9695)|
| 2:41:39| There's nothing to say about SSOs. They're already under control of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=9699)|
| 2:41:43| school system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=9703)|
| 2:41:47| I guess the other thing I want to say is that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=9707)|
| 2:41:51| Mr. Watson's proposal, as he mentioned, has already been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=9711)|
| 2:41:55| under the works for a long time. The coalition decided to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=9715)|
| 2:41:59| put this statement out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=9719)|
| 2:42:03| They felt the urgency about it after Mr. Thompson's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=9723)|
| 2:42:07| filing. They were completely unrelated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=9727)|
| 2:42:11| And so I guess that's as much as I want to say about what the coalition did to clarify.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=9731)|
| 2:42:15| I'd like to speak at this point about my own personal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=9735)|
| 2:42:19| thoughts. I think we need to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=9739)|
| 2:42:23| you know, everything seems to get so polarized. And before we actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=9743)|
| 2:42:27| have the give and take, the discussion where we actually listen to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=9747)|
| 2:42:31| each other, we drop into these my side, your side kind of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=9751)|
| 2:42:35| thing. And these are adult games.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=9755)|
| 2:42:39| I would beg of you and the rest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=9759)|
| 2:42:43| of the community to let's leave our adult games behind and say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=9763)|
| 2:42:47| let's focus on what the kids need, not my side,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=9767)|
| 2:42:51| your side. Let's say what is the best thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=9771)|
| 2:42:55| for our kids. And start from there and look| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=9775)|
| 2:42:59| at the science, look at the research, look at the evidence. Let's try| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=9779)|
| 2:43:03| to do that. Let's try to step away from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=9783)|
| 2:43:07| I mean, we all live in a political world. It's going to be hard, but let's do that. Let's put the kids| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=9787)|
| 2:43:11| first. Let's stop trying to make these things into| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=9791)|
| 2:43:15| yes, no. Let's try to make these things into, you know, where's the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=9795)|
| 2:43:19| yes for everybody? Where's the common ground?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=9799)|
| 2:43:23| So, you know, I think we all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=9803)|
| 2:43:27| are focused on the safety of our children| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=9807)|
| 2:43:31| and as Mr. Watson points out, what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=9811)|
| 2:43:35| that safety, how we perceive what they need and what that safety| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=9815)|
| 2:43:39| looks like is different for each of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=9819)|
| 2:43:43| So, you know, I would urge us to be respectful of the idea that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=9823)|
| 2:43:47| somebody else's idea of what safety means is a little different| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=9827)|
| 2:43:51| than ours. And I would really urge us to try really hard to hear what the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=9831)|
| 2:43:55| kids have to say. Man, you know, some people think, oh, they're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=9835)|
| 2:43:59| just kids, but let me tell you, middle school and high school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=9839)|
| 2:44:03| kids, they know a lot and they know what they think. We should be listening| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=9843)|
| 2:44:07| to them. And let me just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=9847)|
| 2:44:11| say, the last thing is I want to say, I heard a lot of talk about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=9851)|
| 2:44:15| opinions, different opinions, who's got this opinions. Let's set| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=9855)|
| 2:44:19| the opinions aside for a while. Let's go look for the facts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=9859)|
| 2:44:23| If we're going to deal with this MOA| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=9863)|
| 2:44:27| and what we're going to use, how we're going to have police in our schools, how we're going to keep| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=9867)|
| 2:44:31| our kids safe, let's sort of set our opinions aside. We each have our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=9871)|
| 2:44:35| place to start. Let's set it aside and let's go for the facts. Let's do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=9875)|
| 2:44:39| the facts first rather than the facts to defend the position| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=9879)|
| 2:44:43| that we're most comfortable with. Let's look for the facts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=9883)|
| 2:44:47| Personally, I strongly support Mr. Watson's resolution and I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=9887)|
| 2:44:51| support, I think you all want to do have this conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=9891)|
| 2:44:55| I so wish we'd had it two years ago, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=9895)|
| 2:44:59| now let's do it. Let's have that conversation. Let's start| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=9899)|
| 2:45:03| with the facts. Let's keep the focus on what's good for the kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=9903)|
| 2:45:07| Let's keep our egos and our political positions out of it as long as we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=9907)|
| 2:45:11| can. Thank you very much. Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=9911)|
| 2:45:15| Talia Wilson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=9915)|
| 2:45:19| State your first name and county of residence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=9919)|
| 2:45:23| Talia Wilson,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=9923)|
| 2:45:27| Knox County Schools. I would like to start off by saying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=9927)|
| 2:45:31| thank you for taking the time out of your day. I really appreciate you all listening to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=9931)|
| 2:45:35| everyone and taking our words into consideration. I would like to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=9935)|
| 2:45:39| acknowledge our police officers and all that they have done for me and my school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=9939)|
| 2:45:43| I go to a school right in the heart of downtown. It is an open campus that is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=9943)|
| 2:45:47| easily accessible right next to the park and the memorial. Considering the location| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=9947)|
| 2:45:51| of the premises, we have a lot of strangers that will try and come onto campus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=9951)|
| 2:45:55| Some just don't know that it's a school, but some have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=9955)|
| 2:45:59| bad intentions. Our officer has gone above and beyond to guarantee our safety,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=9959)|
| 2:46:03| but not only that, he has offered a safe space for the children| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=9963)|
| 2:46:07| at the school to talk to him and give a shoulder to lean on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=9967)|
| 2:46:11| I understand the concern regarding what happened at Austin East, and I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=9971)|
| 2:46:15| completely give my condolences to Anthony Thompson Jr.'s family, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=9975)|
| 2:46:19| I personally do, I am personally concerned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=9979)|
| 2:46:23| about my safety. I do think that training our officers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=9983)|
| 2:46:27| to be more equipped to work near children is a good idea,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=9987)|
| 2:46:31| but I don't think that taking them out of our schools is necessary. I don't feel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=9991)|
| 2:46:35| safe going to a school without the necessary officer protection to feel safe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=9995)|
| 2:46:39| The Knox County Schools mission statement is to make the Knox County Schools a safe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=9999)|
| 2:46:43| and secure learning environment for everyone. If we can't be assured| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=10003)|
| 2:46:47| that we are safe from the ones with ill will, how are we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=10007)|
| 2:46:51| going to focus on our learning? I am not just worried about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=10011)|
| 2:46:55| our learning on the campus, I'm worried about my high school experience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=10015)|
| 2:46:59| The only outdoor time that we get is the places that the campus| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=10019)|
| 2:47:03| is most exposed to. I love that we can go outside during lunch and play| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=10023)|
| 2:47:07| foursquare and volleyball. I love that we can all go down to World's Fair Park and make memories| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=10027)|
| 2:47:11| with each other during genius hour, but without our officer there to ensure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=10031)|
| 2:47:15| our safety, this would no longer be possible because we would be so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=10035)|
| 2:47:19| exposed to the public. I also wasn't going to speak on this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=10039)|
| 2:47:23| tonight, but I feel it was necessary. I personally don't agree| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=10043)|
| 2:47:27| with sunsetting the mask mandate in schools until the end of the school year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=10047)|
| 2:47:31| I don't think it is fair on the students that choose in person for this year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=10051)|
| 2:47:35| thinking that masks would be mandatory for everyone. However, someone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=10055)|
| 2:47:39| mentioned mask bullying earlier tonight and I would like to speak about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=10059)|
| 2:47:43| I always wore my mask at school because it was mandatory. I never tried to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=10063)|
| 2:47:47| find my way around it. I just did what the board has required us to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=10067)|
| 2:47:51| But that did not prevent someone from bullying me for the type| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=10071)|
| 2:47:55| of mask I was wearing. It was not mesh, it was not see-through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=10075)|
| 2:47:59| It was a two-layer cloth mask and it met every single guideline that was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=10079)|
| 2:48:03| set in place, yet I was still bullied for a piece of cloth on my| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=10083)|
| 2:48:07| face. I realize that there are a lot of opinions on both of these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=10087)|
| 2:48:11| subjects. I just wanted to offer my perspective as a student and I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=10091)|
| 2:48:15| appreciate everyone that was willing to have a conversation about this. I feel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=10095)|
| 2:48:19| like we could all learn so much if we just listen to each other and look at it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=10099)|
| 2:48:23| from everyone's perspective. Thank you for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=10103)|
| 2:48:27| Thank you very much for coming. Tanya Coates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=10107)|

| 2:48:35| I really came to talk about masks, but first let me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=10115)|
| 2:48:39| address the first thing that has come up today in regards to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=10119)|
| 2:48:43| officers, and I want to be very clear about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=10123)|
| 2:48:47| Educators in Knox County do not call for the removal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=10127)|
| 2:48:51| of officers at school. That goes for principals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=10131)|
| 2:48:55| teachers, cafeteria workers, anyone. We did not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=10135)|
| 2:48:59| are not requesting this response.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=10139)|
| 2:49:03| However, we are asking that whenever we have external| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=10143)|
| 2:49:07| officers come to school, that there are some policies and procedures| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=10147)|
| 2:49:11| that have been put in place. I have witnessed and sat with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=10151)|
| 2:49:15| SROs, SSOs, principals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=10155)|
| 2:49:19| classroom teachers being reprimanded| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=10159)|

| 2:49:35| when they come to the school and how they do check these policy and procedures,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=10175)|
| 2:49:39| check in. If we cannot control, if you cannot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=10179)|

| 2:49:59| We know that we, it took us a long time, and I know that Mr. Smith| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=10199)|

| 2:50:07| it took us forever to get school security officers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=10207)|
| 2:50:11| to get officers to help protect us in schools. At least I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=10211)|
| 2:50:15| remind you, those came to fruition when we had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=10215)|
| 2:50:19| a shooting at Central, or when we had a teacher being shot at NSKIP,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=10219)|

| 2:50:47| coming in our school system. Our students entrust you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=10247)|
| 2:50:51| and our parents didn't send criminals to school. So we're just asking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=10251)|
| 2:50:55| you to just look at the policies and procedures| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=10255)|

| 2:51:11| lasting relationships in our schools. And then my last and final point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=10271)|
| 2:51:15| about this mask, and I swear I wish that we weren't talking about that, with 13| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=10275)|
| 2:51:19| and a half days left of school. I understand that you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=10279)|
| 2:51:23| want to do what's best for these kids, but you've heard from a lot of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=10283)|
| 2:51:27| us here that you have given the authority| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=10287)|
| 2:51:31| to your superintendent and his administration. You have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=10291)|
| 2:51:35| passed policies in regards to how masks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=10295)|
| 2:51:39| are supposed to be mandated. But to take it away in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=10299)|
| 2:51:43| 13 and a half days of school, knowing that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=10303)|
| 2:51:47| if a lot of our parents remember in the last couple of years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=10307)|
| 2:51:51| that we have not had a flu epidemic, where we had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=10311)|
| 2:51:55| schools missing school over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=10315)|
| 2:51:59| flus because of masks. We haven't had to have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=10319)|

| 2:52:07| We are not wanting kids to feel like they're bullies. But let me give you some key points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=10327)|
| 2:52:11| Kids, the key is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=10331)|
| 2:52:15| that kids are all right. We just heard from some of them that they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=10335)|
| 2:52:19| go to school every day and they're all right. Do we have a few of them that don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=10339)|
| 2:52:23| want to wear it? Heck, we got educators that don't want to wear masks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=10343)|
| 2:52:27| But we cannot help this. The key is reducing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=10347)|
| 2:52:31| the risk of illness. We also know that kids| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=10351)|
| 2:52:35| are not being vaccinated. Yes, we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=10355)|
| 2:52:39| educators that are being vaccinated. But you know, the protection is not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=10359)|
| 2:52:43| only for our students of wearing these masks. We're saying that it's the protection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=10363)|
| 2:52:47| for adults that have underlying conditions. And parents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=10367)|
| 2:52:51| entrusted us that we signed up for this. I'm just asking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=10371)|
| 2:52:55| you for 13 and a half days. When you pass this next week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=10375)|
| 2:52:59| consider that by that time next week, you only have seven and a half days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=10379)|
| 2:53:03| If it's really that important, we're just asking you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=10383)|
| 2:53:07| don't make it an issue. And then don't use educators,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=10387)|
| 2:53:11| don't use parents, and don't use yourselves| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=10391)|
| 2:53:15| to pit each other against each other when it comes to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=10395)|

| 2:54:53| or get on their phones, they see another Black person has died at the hands of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=10493)|
| 2:54:57| a cop. Everywhere they turn in their communities, they see a KPD| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=10497)|
| 2:55:01| cruiser or an unmarked KPD SUV just waiting for them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=10501)|
| 2:55:05| to make a mistake. So when they see a KPD officer inside| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=10505)|

| 2:55:21| and listen to what the people in our Black and brown communities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=10521)|
| 2:55:25| are telling us. I mean, they have been screaming this at us, so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=10525)|
| 2:55:29| we just need to open our ears and listen to what they are saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=10529)|
| 2:55:33| The students in these communities look at cops in schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=10533)|
| 2:55:37| and see someone who is ready to unlawfully arrest them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=10537)|
| 2:55:41| They see someone who carries a gun and a badge and could easily get away with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=10541)|
| 2:55:45| murdering them at any point. After Anthony Thompson Jr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=10545)|

| 2:55:57| can get away with killing them both on the streets and inside their schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=10557)|
| 2:56:01| Nowhere is safe for them. Furthermore,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=10561)|
| 2:56:05| the relationship between KPD and Knox County schools is problematic in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=10565)|
| 2:56:09| other ways as well. During my tenure with KCS, I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=10569)|
| 2:56:13| once observed a nonverbal special education student get left at school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=10573)|
| 2:56:17| at the end of the day. This was likely due to a miscommunication| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=10577)|
| 2:56:21| and because of socioeconomic barriers, the school staff could not get in contact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=10581)|
| 2:56:25| with the student's caregivers. Knox County's solution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=10585)|
| 2:56:29| was to partner with the SROs at Fulton and call in reinforcements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=10589)|
| 2:56:33| from KPD to escort this student back home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=10593)|
| 2:56:37| So, they stuck a Black, nonverbal young adult| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=10597)|
| 2:56:41| in the back of a cop car alone and let KPD| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=10601)|
| 2:56:45| just leave school grounds with this student. To my knowledge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=10605)|
| 2:56:49| the student made it home okay, but where is the accountability?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=10609)|
| 2:56:53| If the cop had done anything to that student or mistreated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=10613)|
| 2:56:57| them in any way, the student wouldn't have been able to communicate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=10617)|
| 2:57:01| that to anyone. If the student had had any sort of maladaptive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=10621)|
| 2:57:05| behaviors, the cops were not trained to deal with that and people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=10625)|
| 2:57:09| special education teachers or anyone who was appropriately| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=10629)|
| 2:57:13| trained to deal with that was not present. Like, Knox County, do you not care about your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=10633)|
| 2:57:17| students? These situations were handled completely poorly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=10637)|
| 2:57:21| That was a horrible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=10641)|
| 2:57:25| policy and a horrible way to handle that situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=10645)|
| 2:57:29| Just, Knox County, that made me furious. Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210505?start=10649)|
