| 0:06:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=416)|
| 0:06:57| Thank you, Dr. McIntyre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=417)|
| 0:07:03| Name and address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=423)|
| 0:07:04| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=424)|
| 0:07:05| Mr. Chairman, my name is Jim McIntyre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=425)|
| 0:07:07| I'm the superintendent of schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=427)|
| 0:07:08| I'm at 912 South K Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=428)|
| 0:07:10| Mr. McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=430)|
| 0:07:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=431)|
| 0:07:12| Now, I'll freely admit that I haven't read the details of this resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=432)|
| 0:07:18| I just wanted to know, is this gas, electric?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=438)|
| 0:07:22| I mean, what's the?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=442)|
| 0:07:24| Is there an upgrade to the school or they're just needing to get access?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=444)|
| 0:07:29| Commissioner, to be honest with you, I would have to bring one of our folks from our facilities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=449)|
| 0:07:34| and maintenance department for next week if that's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=454)|
| 0:07:36| Yeah, that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=456)|
| 0:07:37| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=457)|
| 0:07:38| It's what we discussed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=458)|
| 0:07:39| I'm sure it's routine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=459)|
| 0:07:40| I'm just curious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=460)|
| 0:07:41| It is routine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=461)|
| 0:07:42| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=462)|
| 0:07:43| It's an easement for the utility to be able to access the property for the purposes of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=463)|
| 0:07:49| maintenance of the utility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=469)|
| 0:07:50| But in terms of the specifics of it, I can certainly have Mr. French or Mr. Dillingham| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=470)|
| 0:07:54| here next week to talk about the specifics, if you like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=474)|
| 0:07:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=477)|
| 0:07:58| Mr. Owenby.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=478)|
| 0:07:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=479)|
| 0:08:03| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=483)|
| 0:08:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=484)|
| 0:08:05| A motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=485)|
| 0:08:06| All in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=486)|
| 0:08:07| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=487)|
| 0:08:08| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=488)|
| 0:08:09| Ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=489)|
| 0:08:10| And he's going to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=490)|
| 0:08:11| And he'll come back with it next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=491)|
| 0:08:15| Page four, item number 12, consideration of a resolution approving contracts with TransTech| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=495)|
| 0:08:24| Inc.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=504)|
| 0:08:25| Doing Businesses Budget Transmissions for Transmission Repair and Rebuild Services,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=505)|
| 0:08:29| Resolution 404.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=509)|
| 0:08:30| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=510)|
| 0:08:31| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=511)|
| 0:08:32| And a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=512)|
| 0:08:33| Thank you, Mr. Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=513)|
| 0:08:34| Mr. McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=514)|
| 0:08:35| Dwight, could you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=515)|
| 0:08:36| And maybe Hugh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=516)|
| 0:08:37| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=517)|
| 0:08:38| I'm just trying to figure out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=518)|
| 0:08:40| You know, I'm always in the spirit of competitive bids and keeping dollar values down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=520)|
| 0:08:54| Is this going to hurt us, basically having a single source?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=534)|
| 0:08:57| I'm guessing there was a bid process and there was two successful bidders and we awarded| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=537)|
| 0:09:02| both for good reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=542)|
| 0:09:04| Does this hurt our stance in getting competitive pricing or should we re-bid this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=544)|
| 0:09:10| I just want to, just in general, just, I mean, it seems like this could be a pretty lucrative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=550)|
| 0:09:15| contract in terms of transmission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=555)|
| 0:09:17| I've had a couple go out on me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=557)|
| 0:09:20| Hugh Holt, 1000 North Central Street, Purchasing Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=560)|
| 0:09:26| This bid process included three different vendors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=566)|
| 0:09:30| We spoke with Engineering and Public Works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=570)|
| 0:09:33| They didn't want to award to the third vendor because their pricing was so out of competitive range.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=573)|
| 0:09:39| So, we can watch it and watch it on a quarterly basis to see how the prices are, how it is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=579)|
| 0:09:48| affecting the overall cost of the service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=588)|
| 0:09:50| But we have many, many single awards at the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=590)|
| 0:09:57| Can you shed any light as to why the other outfit chose not to accept the award?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=597)|
| 0:10:08| They accepted the award and then there was an issue of conflict of interest that came up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=608)|
| 0:10:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=616)|
| 0:10:17| Yeah, I'd just be interested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=617)|
| 0:10:18| I would just hate for costs to we get locked into something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=618)|
| 0:10:23| I guess if we approve this, we're approving only a contract with the budget transmission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=623)|
| 0:10:30| And that could be, I mean, troubling if not watched.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=630)|
| 0:10:35| But it sounds like you guys are going to keep an eye on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=635)|
| 0:10:37| So, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=637)|
| 0:10:39| I'd like to add one thing, Mr. McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=639)|
| 0:10:41| We do like multiple vendor awards because one of the things we watch at the service center is turnaround time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=641)|
| 0:10:47| And if a single transmission shop is backed up, people aren't looking at them as to why their car is not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=647)|
| 0:10:52| back in service or looking to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=652)|
| 0:10:54| We would have preferred multiple vendors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=654)|
| 0:10:56| It just didn't work out that way this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=656)|
| 0:10:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=658)|
| 0:10:59| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=659)|
| 0:11:00| Dwight, let me ask one other question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=660)|
| 0:11:03| The way I read the caption is it's one company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=663)|
| 0:11:07| Is this two separate companies and one pulled out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=667)|
| 0:11:10| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=670)|
| 0:11:11| The original caption was two separate companies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=671)|
| 0:11:13| The remaining Transtech is doing business as transmissions for transmission repair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=673)|
| 0:11:20| That's one business entity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=680)|
| 0:11:21| So, we, as Commissioner McKenzie alluded to, we are awarding this to this one business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=681)|
| 0:11:29| This is semantics for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=689)|
| 0:11:31| Economy transmissions and economy transmissions is the one company that pulled out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=691)|
| 0:11:39| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=699)|
| 0:11:40| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=700)|
| 0:11:41| And Transtech doing business as budget is the second one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=701)|
| 0:11:44| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=704)|
| 0:11:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=705)|
| 0:11:46| Okay, Mr. Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=706)|
| 0:11:51| I think they got their lights off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=711)|
| 0:11:52| Oh, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=712)|
| 0:11:54| Oh, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=714)|
| 0:11:58| Okay, any other questions there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=718)|
| 0:12:00| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=720)|
| 0:12:02| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=722)|
| 0:12:03| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=723)|
| 0:12:04| Ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=724)|
| 0:12:07| Item number 15, consideration of a resolution approving an amulet service agreement with rural metro of Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=727)|
| 0:12:15| to provide medical amulet services in Knox County for a five-year term, July 1, 2013, through June 30, 2018,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=735)|
| 0:12:24| with the option to renew for additional five-year terms subject to county commission approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=744)|
| 0:12:30| This is resolution 603.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=750)|
| 0:12:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=752)|
| 0:12:33| Motion to approve, Mr. Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=753)|
| 0:12:36| And a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=756)|
| 0:12:38| Mr. Irwin will be okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=758)|
| 0:12:40| Mr. Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=760)|
| 0:12:42| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=762)|
| 0:12:43| I have a number of questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=763)|
| 0:12:45| I hope it doesn't go past my allotted five minutes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=765)|
| 0:12:47| but I would appreciate any indulgence that you could give me since we are in a workshop setting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=767)|
| 0:12:53| It became painfully aware to me last night how important amulet service is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=773)|
| 0:12:58| As I was driving down Chapman Highway on my way home,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=778)|
| 0:13:00| and there was a four-car accident there on Chapman Highway, and I saw the amulets there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=780)|
| 0:13:04| And as I was thinking about it, I thought, you know, if I'm working on my little farm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=784)|
| 0:13:08| and something happens to me, response time is going to be key.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=788)|
| 0:13:11| And I need to know that not only for me, but for other citizens of Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=791)|
| 0:13:15| that when we award this amulets contract, that we're awarding it to a firm that is the best firm that we can have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=795)|
| 0:13:22| with regards to care, but also with regards to cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=802)|
| 0:13:25| I don't have any question that any of the three companies that submitted bids would provide that level of care| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=805)|
| 0:13:32| and provide that level of service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=812)|
| 0:13:33| So that is not any issue that I have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=813)|
| 0:13:36| The issue, I guess, that I have, and as I met with each of the three companies before this process began,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=816)|
| 0:13:41| I told them that my concern was the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=821)|
| 0:13:44| I wanted to make sure, in my mind, that the process was above board, that it was transparent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=824)|
| 0:13:49| and that it was fair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=829)|
| 0:13:52| And so there has been a protest that has been filed, and I know that it's going through the appeals process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=832)|
| 0:13:57| But I would like to ask some questions here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=837)|
| 0:13:59| And let me preface my remarks by saying that the questions that I'm asked,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=839)|
| 0:14:03| I'm not interested in embarrassing anyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=843)|
| 0:14:05| I'm not interested in doing anything that would be considered negative at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=845)|
| 0:14:10| I want to get facts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=850)|
| 0:14:12| I'm not interested in talking, hearing, seeing any more press releases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=852)|
| 0:14:16| I want to see facts, and I want to make my decision based upon that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=856)|
| 0:14:19| So my first question, we'll go to Mr. Hugh Holt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=859)|
| 0:14:22| Is Mr. Holt here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=862)|
| 0:14:25| Hugh, could you give us just a rundown as to how the process began with regards to the people who were selected for this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=865)|
| 0:14:33| I know that there were seven people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=873)|
| 0:14:35| Can you enlighten us as to how these individuals were selected to be on this panel?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=875)|
| 0:14:40| Consistent with the code, if you look in our purchasing regulations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=880)|
| 0:14:44| it says that we will have a representative from the end-using department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=884)|
| 0:14:49| There will be a representative from purchasing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=889)|
| 0:14:52| And there will be representatives on that committee who have been deemed subject matter experts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=892)|
| 0:14:58| or stakeholders in the system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=898)|
| 0:15:01| And that's how those people were selected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=901)|
| 0:15:04| I got names from commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=904)|
| 0:15:07| I got names from employees from our health department who administer the contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=907)|
| 0:15:12| So that's how they were selected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=912)|
| 0:15:14| So who made the final determination as to who the seven would be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=914)|
| 0:15:18| Well, the purchasing division made a recommendation of a committee to the mayor's office who affirmed that my recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=918)|
| 0:15:29| But you feel that your recommendation was such that you followed the code and that you were,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=929)|
| 0:15:34| you weren't trying to stack the deck with anybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=934)|
| 0:15:36| You wanted to get a cross-section of people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=936)|
| 0:15:38| No, sir, never do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=938)|
| 0:15:41| It's my job to ensure that we get committees made up of professionals who are ethical| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=941)|
| 0:15:48| and bring an air of integrity to a process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=948)|
| 0:15:52| And I feel that happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=952)|
| 0:15:53| We had a committee that had over 140 years of EMS experience, two physicians,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=953)|
| 0:16:00| representatives from the Knoxville Fire Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=960)|
| 0:16:03| It was a well-rounded group, one of the best that we've ever had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=963)|
| 0:16:07| When was the last time you went through this process?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=967)|
| 0:16:10| Ten years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=970)|
| 0:16:12| And did you follow the same procedure ten years ago with regards to the selection of the people on the panel?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=972)|
| 0:16:19| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=979)|
| 0:16:20| And, in fact, we actually had 11 committee members on that particular bidding event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=980)|
| 0:16:28| So why did we go from 11 to seven?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=988)|
| 0:16:31| Very unmanageable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=991)|
| 0:16:32| There were some, in my opinion, there were some people in the past that had a seat on that committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=992)|
| 0:16:38| that may have not brought any additional value to the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=998)|
| 0:16:45| With regards to potential conflict of interest, how were these people vetted that you put on the committee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=1005)|
| 0:16:50| They were all required to sign a conflict of interest statement which went into detail about their associations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=1010)|
| 0:16:58| with any of the EMS services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=1018)|
| 0:17:01| Did you find that any of them had a conflict of interest?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=1021)|
| 0:17:03| Were there any potential red flags that you had that anyone there might have had a conflict of interest?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=1023)|
| 0:17:08| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=1028)|
| 0:17:11| How often did this committee meet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=1031)|
| 0:17:12| And can you fill us in on the process that you used in evaluating the bids| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=1032)|
| 0:17:17| or the criteria that came in from each of the three companies?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=1037)|
| 0:17:21| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=1041)|
| 0:17:22| It's typical of any other evaluation that happens in the purchasing division is that there was a planning meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=1042)|
| 0:17:31| where we got the committee together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=1051)|
| 0:17:33| We gave them a set of instructions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=1053)|
| 0:17:35| Of course, we spoke to them on the front end and thanked them for serving the citizens of Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=1055)|
| 0:17:40| because they are serving the citizens of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=1060)|
| 0:17:44| Nobody gets paid on this committee other than the employees who are paid to do that job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=1064)|
| 0:17:51| So they were, like I said, there was an initial meeting of the committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=1071)|
| 0:17:56| They were given instructions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=1076)|
| 0:17:59| Once the proposals were opened, then the committee was then passed that information out by the purchasing division| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=1079)|
| 0:18:07| representative, which is Matt Myers, my deputy director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=1087)|
| 0:18:11| They were asked to independently evaluate each proposal and rank them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=1091)|
| 0:18:17| And then after that process happened, we then went back to determine for the competitive range purpose who needed to be interviewed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=1097)|
| 0:18:28| It was the determination of the committee as a group that we needed to interview all three vendors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=1108)|
| 0:18:36| And we did so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=1116)|
| 0:18:38| After the interviews, the committee members were allowed to go back and re-rank| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=1118)|
| 0:18:45| or re-score those vendors if they chose so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=1125)|
| 0:18:50| If they weren't moved in any way, positive or negative, their scores could have remained the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=1130)|
| 0:18:57| And that happened in a couple of instances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=1137)|
| 0:19:01| Once we had all the evaluations returned, Matt Myers compiled each score or each score from each evaluator for a cumulative score,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=1141)|
| 0:19:14| which resulted in AMR or, excuse me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=1154)|
| 0:19:17| resulted in Rural Metro being the successful proposer by 72 points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=1157)|
| 0:19:23| As you went through this process and as the people heard and as they interviewed the participants and so forth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=1163)|
| 0:19:30| was there a collective meeting of everyone to do their scoring or was it done privately| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=1170)|
| 0:19:36| and then they gave you the scores?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=1176)|
| 0:19:37| How did that occur?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=1177)|
| 0:19:39| They were offered a place to go and re-evaluate or re-assess their scoring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=1179)|
| 0:19:47| Or some chose to take it with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=1187)|
| 0:19:49| Some chose to step out of the room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=1189)|
| 0:19:52| Some chose to go to the end of the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=1192)|
| 0:19:55| But, again, still independent, each one not knowing how the other has scored.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=1195)|
| 0:20:00| In your mind, was there any collusion or collaboration among these people with their scoring?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=1200)|
| 0:20:04| Were there any discussions about, well, I scored it this way, you scored it that way?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=1204)|
| 0:20:09| Was there any of those types of discussions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=1209)|
| 0:20:11| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=1211)|
| 0:20:12| And you could look at the final scoring to see the diversity in the scoring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=1212)|
| 0:20:19| It's obvious there was no collusion that went on between those committee members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=1219)|
| 0:20:25| It's you can take it on its face value.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=1225)|
| 0:20:29| So of the seven, there were, was it three that scored AMR higher, three that scored Rural Metro,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=1229)|
| 0:20:36| and one that did the other company, I believe it's Falk?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=1236)|
| 0:20:38| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=1238)|
| 0:20:39| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=1239)|
| 0:20:40| So it was three, three, and one as far as the numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=1240)|
| 0:20:42| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=1242)|
| 0:20:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=1243)|
| 0:20:45| That would indicate to me that it was fairly close between the two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=1245)|
| 0:20:48| Yes, it was closer than that after the initial ranking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=1248)|
| 0:20:53| And that, we call it, the two phases are initial ranking and then final ranking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=1253)|
| 0:20:58| Now, one of the things that I have seen from the protest, I guess you might say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=1258)|
| 0:21:02| is that there were a couple of the scores that had scoring for one company way above the other,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=1262)|
| 0:21:11| whereas the others seemed to have them kind of even.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=1271)|
| 0:21:13| Would you say that that is correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=1273)|
| 0:21:16| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=1276)|
| 0:21:17| And that's the reason we have a panel of subject matter experts because Matt Myers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=1277)|
| 0:21:26| who works for me, is not involved in the day-to-day operations of the EMS system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=1286)|
| 0:21:33| whereas many others on that committee, in fact, all are involved in day-to-day operations of some EMS system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=1293)|
| 0:21:41| Did you talk with the individuals on the panel about their scoring and why they scored the way they did?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=1301)|
| 0:21:46| Was there any type of feedback that you got from them as they submitted to you their documents and their materials?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=1306)|
| 0:21:54| No, not individually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=1314)|
| 0:21:56| We did speak with each one of them to address a claim that was made in the protest letter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=1316)|
| 0:22:04| in regard to Mr. Hutzel's influence and spoke to all the committee members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=1324)|
| 0:22:09| and all adamantly said, no, Mr. Hutzel did not influence their scoring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=1329)|
| 0:22:15| Was there anything in there to indicate to you that there was any type of conflict of interest with regards to the scoring| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=1335)|
| 0:22:22| and the individuals who did the scoring?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=1342)|
| 0:22:24| And, I mean, was there anything in there that raised a red flag in your mind,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=1344)|
| 0:22:29| that this was not a fair, open, complete process?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=1349)|
| 0:22:34| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=1354)|
| 0:22:37| Thank you, Mr. Holt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=1357)|
| 0:22:38| Is Mr. Hutzel here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=1358)|
| 0:22:39| Is he available to answer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=1359)|
| 0:22:45| Could you give us your name and address of the record, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=1365)|
| 0:22:47| Larry Hutzel, emergency response coordinator for the Knox County Health Department, 140 Dameron Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=1367)|
| 0:22:54| I've known you for a few years, and so, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=1374)|
| 0:22:56| I want to reiterate I'm not here to put you on the spot or to embarrass you in any way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=1376)|
| 0:23:00| but your name has been brought up, and I felt that I needed to ask you this, you know, a couple of questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=1380)|
| 0:23:05| So, again, I just wanted to preface by saying that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=1385)|
| 0:23:10| There has been some question about a conflict of interest with you coming in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=1390)|
| 0:23:15| and applying for a position with Rural Metro.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=1395)|
| 0:23:19| Can you tell us what is the situation with that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=1399)|
| 0:23:24| Well, number one, I did not or nor I have ever applied for a position with Rural Metro.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=1404)|
| 0:23:30| There was a position that became available with the EMS Board, and I was interested in that position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=1410)|
| 0:23:37| And I talked to several people about it, and that's how that came about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=1417)|
| 0:23:42| That was the extent of my resume.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=1422)|
| 0:23:45| So what is your relationship with Rural Metro?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=1425)|
| 0:23:47| Well, right now I'm the contract compliance officer, make sure that they're meeting their contract standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=1427)|
| 0:23:54| As well as on the other side of the house, we have a public health emergency preparedness grant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=1434)|
| 0:24:00| So I do two things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=1440)|
| 0:24:02| So what was your involvement with the committee in terms of as they were going through this process?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=1442)|
| 0:24:08| What was your involvement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=1448)|
| 0:24:12| I had been --I retired from the Tennessee Department of Health| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=1452)|
| 0:24:15| after 25 years of experience as an EMS consultant back in 2002,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=1455)|
| 0:24:19| when I took this job with the Knox County Health Department in emergency preparedness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=1459)|
| 0:24:22| So between the two jobs and knowing the EMS rules and regulations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=1462)|
| 0:24:26| I started working with the compliance stuff for the contract, I mean, for the time Rural Metro.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=1466)|
| 0:24:33| So with my background in EMS| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=1473)|
| 0:24:35| and being involved in the day-to-day operations for the service and, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=1475)|
| 0:24:40| I was there to answer questions from the committee about, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=1480)|
| 0:24:44| pertinent questions dealing with the RFP or their proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=1484)|
| 0:24:48| Did you do anything at any time to try to steer the participants toward one contractor or another?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=1488)|
| 0:24:55| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=1495)|
| 0:24:57| Thank you, Mr. Hudson-Lyon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=1497)|
| 0:24:58| I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=1498)|
| 0:24:59| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=1499)|
| 0:25:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=1500)|
| 0:25:01| Good to see you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=1501)|
| 0:25:02| I don't know if Mr. Dabbs is here or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=1502)|
| 0:25:03| I don't know him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=1503)|
| 0:25:04| He's not here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=1504)|
| 0:25:07| If you would answer this question, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=1507)|
| 0:25:08| And I'm about done, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=1508)|
| 0:25:11| His name was brought up, too, as a possible conflict of interest because of an association with his employment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=1511)|
| 0:25:21| Help me with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=1521)|
| 0:25:22| What exactly is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=1522)|
| 0:25:25| Dr. Dabbs said that he would be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=1525)|
| 0:25:27| He would have been here today, but he had a conflict.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=1527)|
| 0:25:29| He will be here next Monday, if need be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=1529)|
| 0:25:34| But I will say this about Dr. Randall Dabbs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=1534)|
| 0:25:37| He was one of the most impartial evaluators on the committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=1537)|
| 0:25:43| and probably the most critical of the incumbent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=1543)|
| 0:25:48| And I'll leave it at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=1548)|
| 0:25:51| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=1551)|
| 0:25:52| I appreciate the indulgence, and you're giving me the extra few minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=1552)|
| 0:25:55| Mr. McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=1555)|
| 0:25:57| Thank you, Mr. Hugh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=1557)|
| 0:25:58| Don't go too far.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=1558)|
| 0:26:00| I just have one, I think, fairly simple question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=1560)|
| 0:26:02| and it's something that Commissioner Hammond brought up about appeals and whatnot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=1562)|
| 0:26:07| Is there anything keeping us from approving this resolution today and or next Monday?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=1567)|
| 0:26:17| Is there anything outstanding as far as the process that would keep us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=1577)|
| 0:26:23| I'm not the attorney here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=1583)|
| 0:26:26| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=1586)|
| 0:26:27| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=1587)|
| 0:26:28| I could, from my staff perspective, know, but that's a legal question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=1588)|
| 0:26:34| I'll turn to Bud.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=1594)|
| 0:26:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=1596)|
| 0:26:37| Commissioner McKenzie, currently they're in a process of appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=1597)|
| 0:26:42| They have finished and completed one step in that process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=1602)|
| 0:26:46| The next step, if they so choose to do it, they have between now, I believe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=1606)|
| 0:26:50| and Wednesday at the end of closing business to appeal to the chairman or director of finance at Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=1610)|
| 0:26:59| He then will have five days to where he can respond back in writing to their appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=1619)|
| 0:27:04| Subject to that, whatever that ruling is, I don't know what it will be, if it's not in their favor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=1624)|
| 0:27:10| they have three more days to appeal then to the chief executive of the mayor of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=1630)|
| 0:27:15| He can take it under advisement and deal with it at his discretion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=1635)|
| 0:27:19| and I'll probably meet with him on that, you know, for a time limit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=1639)|
| 0:27:22| But he has no particular time limit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=1642)|
| 0:27:25| So right now the process itself is laid out that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=1645)|
| 0:27:31| The only thing that my recommendation would be to let the process proceed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=1651)|
| 0:27:37| but in that process there's also a note that and I don't know the facts for this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=1657)|
| 0:27:44| but if the delay itself in this contract would endanger citizens of Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=1664)|
| 0:27:50| or if it would add additional or cause additional or extended damage to Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=1670)|
| 0:27:57| or if it would adversely affect Knox County programs in any way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=1677)|
| 0:28:02| the process itself says then the purchasing process should continue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=1682)|
| 0:28:07| So that is a caveat that is fact driven.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=1687)|
| 0:28:10| I can't speak beyond that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=1690)|
| 0:28:12| But the legal recommendation would be is to let the process take its course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=1692)|
| 0:28:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=1700)|
| 0:28:22| Chris, Mr. Caldwell, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=1702)|
| 0:28:24| Chris Caldwell, 400 Main Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=1704)|
| 0:28:26| Going to the law director's point about a department may having an adverse effect of the delay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=1706)|
| 0:28:33| if you would so let me, I'd like to call on Chief Coker from E911.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=1713)|
| 0:28:40| He is going to implement a CAD system here very shortly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=1720)|
| 0:28:44| and this could have an adverse effect on him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=1724)|
| 0:28:47| I will let him speak to that, though it's more of his thing than mine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=1727)|
| 0:28:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=1730)|
| 0:28:51| Thank you, Mr. Caldwell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=1731)|
| 0:28:52| Come ahead, Mr. Coker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=1732)|
| 0:28:56| Give your name and address, please, Chief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=1736)|
| 0:28:58| Bob Coker, 605 Barnard Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=1738)|
| 0:29:02| First thing, I want to apologize to the commissioners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=1742)|
| 0:29:05| and the staff here for appearing and looking this way with this nice little knot and black eye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=1745)|
| 0:29:11| But I tripped over my wife's CAD and destroyed the table with my face.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=1751)|
| 0:29:16| I do apologize for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=1756)|
| 0:29:19| We are in the middle of buying a new CAD system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=1759)|
| 0:29:23| This has been a 14-month project for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=1763)|
| 0:29:27| We've done our due diligence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=1767)|
| 0:29:30| We've made site visits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=1770)|
| 0:29:32| We've had demos have vendors come in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=1772)|
| 0:29:35| We put the RFP out of our purchase and put the RFP out for us after we constructed it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=1775)|
| 0:29:40| We did the bid review, negotiations, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=1780)|
| 0:29:44| Now, for the last month, we've been slow walking this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=1784)|
| 0:29:47| And the reason we have been slow walking is because of the ambulance contract,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=1787)|
| 0:29:51| not knowing who the partners are going to be for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=1791)|
| 0:29:54| As soon as the bid was awarded originally, I went ahead and called them, called the vendors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=1794)|
| 0:30:03| And the reason I called the vendors is we've got until the 19th of this month to go ahead and sign that contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=1803)|
| 0:30:10| They gave us one extension, and they've indicated they didn't want to give us another one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=1810)|
| 0:30:16| So that could change the price wise for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=1816)|
| 0:30:19| So it really puts us under the gun, to put it mildly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=1819)|
| 0:30:23| Second thing is we're under timelines also on the radio system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=1823)|
| 0:30:28| As we've been talking about this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=1828)|
| 0:30:31| we've got some emergency materials stored to keep us going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=1831)|
| 0:30:35| But both the cab that's up for bid right now and the radio system is at end of life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=1835)|
| 0:30:41| So we're really, really short walking that one or fast walking that one as far as the radio system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=1841)|
| 0:30:48| But we're trying to get this cab bought in this fiscal year so that we can go ahead| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=1848)|
| 0:30:52| and proceed in the next fiscal year with the radio system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=1852)|
| 0:30:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=1859)|
| 0:31:00| Thank you, Chief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=1860)|
| 0:31:01| Hold on just a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=1861)|
| 0:31:02| We may have a question for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=1862)|
| 0:31:04| Dr. Briggs is next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=1864)|
| 0:31:05| Go ahead, Dr. Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=1865)|
| 0:31:07| I'll defer if anyone has any questions because I have some other comments that I want to make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=1867)|
| 0:31:11| Questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=1871)|
| 0:31:12| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=1872)|
| 0:31:13| I do have one question for Mr. Corcoran, and I'd like to make a couple of comments after Dr. Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=1873)|
| 0:31:18| You said you contacted the vendors that had submitted bids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=1878)|
| 0:31:23| I'm sorry?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=1883)|
| 0:31:25| After you got your last bid in, you contacted the vendors, the MS vendors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=1885)|
| 0:31:32| who had submitted the three who had submitted bids, but you didn't go any further.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=1892)|
| 0:31:35| What was the result of your conversations with them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=1895)|
| 0:31:40| I'm not sure what the question is, Mr. Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=1900)|
| 0:31:42| I was assuming that you're buying this system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=1902)|
| 0:31:46| and you were contacting them to see if it was compatible with what they had running| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=1906)|
| 0:31:51| or would be running or what have you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=1911)|
| 0:31:54| And you didn't get you were inferring there was a connection somewhere between your system you're buying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=1914)|
| 0:32:02| and the ambulance service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=1922)|
| 0:32:04| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=1924)|
| 0:32:05| They're currently not on our CAD system right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=1925)|
| 0:32:09| And part of this contract was a requirement that they come on our system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=1929)|
| 0:32:14| Well, you said you had contacted them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=1934)|
| 0:32:15| What was the result of that contact?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=1935)|
| 0:32:18| Are they coming on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=1938)|
| 0:32:19| Will they come on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=1939)|
| 0:32:20| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=1940)|
| 0:32:21| All three?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=1941)|
| 0:32:22| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=1942)|
| 0:32:23| The rural metro especially is, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=1943)|
| 0:32:27| extremely anxious to get on it because their CAD is at the end of their life, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=1947)|
| 0:32:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=1951)|
| 0:32:32| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=1952)|
| 0:32:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=1953)|
| 0:32:34| Dr. Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=1954)|
| 0:32:35| If you would, Mr. Chairman, thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=1955)|
| 0:32:37| Are you finished, Mike?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=1957)|
| 0:32:40| No, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=1960)|
| 0:32:41| Oh, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=1961)|
| 0:32:42| Yeah, what I wanted to do is just to sort of review the contract a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=1962)|
| 0:32:45| We didn't have this presented, some of the details of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=1965)|
| 0:32:48| and there's some members of the commission that may or may not know what some of the details| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=1968)|
| 0:32:52| in the contract are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=1972)|
| 0:32:54| And it may be also worthwhile to let the public know just about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=1974)|
| 0:32:58| We're sort of talking around it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=1978)|
| 0:32:59| And I thought the questions that Commissioner Hammond asked were very good about the process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=1979)|
| 0:33:03| about how we got there, how the selection was made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=1983)|
| 0:33:07| But I wanted to go over just a few things that were in the contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=1987)|
| 0:33:10| And certainly, you know, Mr. Holt and Mr. Caldwell, if you all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=1990)|
| 0:33:14| or anyone else, if I have some errors here, let me know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=1994)|
| 0:33:18| I did take the opportunity last week after the appeal was filed both to talk to representatives of rural metro,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=1998)|
| 0:33:25| of AMR, and I talked to the finance office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=2005)|
| 0:33:29| And I believe I talked to some other people, too, but just to get some details of the contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=2009)|
| 0:33:35| First of all, this contract was a contract for five years with the county to provide the ambulances service| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=2015)|
| 0:33:42| with the opportunity of two five-year renewals after that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=2022)|
| 0:33:47| The second part of the contract was that some people in some of our constituents may ask about is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=2027)|
| 0:33:54| that there will be a 12 percent increase in some of the fees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=2034)|
| 0:33:58| I'll note also that there had been no increase in the fees since 2008,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=2038)|
| 0:34:04| and there will be no further increases for the next three years on the contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=2044)|
| 0:34:09| Part of that 12 percent increase is to cover indigent cares, indigent calls that the ambulance has to make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=2049)|
| 0:34:17| Previously, the county was contributing over $600,000 for these calls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=2057)|
| 0:34:23| And in this present contract, the county will be paying nothing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=2063)|
| 0:34:28| So that also covers some of those calls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=2068)|
| 0:34:32| I know there's a concern that Mr. Hammond brought up about the ambulances when you call them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=2072)|
| 0:34:41| getting there within a certain period of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=2081)|
| 0:34:42| And that's also come up before that the ambulances have been slow, and that's all relative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=2082)|
| 0:34:49| But according to the contract, and this was in the old contract also,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=2089)|
| 0:34:52| when these ambulances don't get there within a certain period of time, there are penalties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=2092)|
| 0:34:57| So whoever gets the contract has to pay a penalty when their ambulance doesn't meet certain standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=2097)|
| 0:35:03| that's set forth by the county on getting there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=2103)|
| 0:35:08| And, as a matter of fact, rural metro between August of 2011 and August of 2012 paid $67,000 in fines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=2108)|
| 0:35:17| The other part, and I believe this is how the fines are calculated before there was a 15-day look-back period,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=2117)|
| 0:35:23| is to see what the fines would be for the average response time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=2123)|
| 0:35:27| And now it's going to be a 30-day period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=2127)|
| 0:35:32| And the message to the county and to the residents on this is that if, let's say, you're 10 days into it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=2132)|
| 0:35:38| and whoever has the contract previously when it was under a 15-day look-back saw that their times were long,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=2138)|
| 0:35:46| they could get more ambulances out there for just a few days to average out good response times| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=2146)|
| 0:35:51| and avoid the penalties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=2151)|
| 0:35:53| On a 30-day look-back, that makes it much more difficult to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=2153)|
| 0:35:58| In other words, they have to be certain that the ambulances are available to respond really all the time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=2158)|
| 0:36:04| because you just don't have a short period of time when you can do a make-up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=2164)|
| 0:36:12| I've already mentioned or we just mentioned right now that there's going to be an update of this CAD system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=2172)|
| 0:36:21| for the EMS 9-1-1 system, the E-9-1-1 system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=2181)|
| 0:36:27| And one of the other items that I think that came out of this contract is that for the citizens of the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=2187)|
| 0:36:34| there was a savings under the recommended vendor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=2194)|
| 0:36:38| In other words, under Rural Metro, about $1.8 million will be the ultimate savings to the county residents on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=2198)|
| 0:36:47| And I believe that those are some of the main points of the contract that are there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=2207)|
| 0:36:54| and that's what the contract is all about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=2214)|
| 0:37:00| I mostly wanted to make those statements just so people knew what was in the contract| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=2220)|
| 0:37:03| and what we were really dealing with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=2223)|
| 0:37:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=2226)|
| 0:37:07| Thank you, Dr. Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=2227)|
| 0:37:08| Excuse me, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=2228)|
| 0:37:10| I don't want to ---- I know Dr. Dabbs, Randall Dabbs, isn't here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=2230)|
| 0:37:15| but I am aware of his position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=2235)|
| 0:37:18| Let me make a disclosure up front that I do know him,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=2238)|
| 0:37:20| and I do know him as a very person of integrity that's been involved in many activities in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=2240)|
| 0:37:29| He was one of the co-founders of Team Health.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=2249)|
| 0:37:32| And my understanding from talking to the representatives of AMR is that the parent organization of AMR| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=2252)|
| 0:37:44| also provides emergency room physician contracting to emergency rooms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=2264)|
| 0:37:50| And what the alleged conflict was is that that's what Team Health does, is that they provide the contract with hospitals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=2270)|
| 0:37:58| Dr. Dabbs is an emergency room physician.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=2278)|
| 0:38:01| And his company, Team Health, which I believe is a company on the stock exchanges now that they've gone public,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=2281)|
| 0:38:10| is also a company that provides contracts to the hospital, and that was the alleged conflict.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=2290)|
| 0:38:18| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=2298)|
| 0:38:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=2299)|
| 0:38:20| And thank you for digging into those details of the contract for us and summarizing them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=2300)|
| 0:38:24| Mr. Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=2304)|
| 0:38:26| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=2306)|
| 0:38:27| First, I'd like to thank Commissioner Hammond and Commissioner Briggs for the additional information they put forth today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=2307)|
| 0:38:35| And also, Hugh, for your candor in answering the questions that were asked you earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=2315)|
| 0:38:43| And I think things are pretty clear right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=2323)|
| 0:38:47| You know, when you have, I don't know, what, 1,800, 2,000 employees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=2327)|
| 0:38:52| if you've got 100 employees, every once in a while you're going to get a glitch in one of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=2332)|
| 0:38:59| I don't care if it's ABC company, CEF company, or whoever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=2339)|
| 0:39:05| Rural Metro has served Knox County well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=2345)|
| 0:39:09| The thing that bothers me the most about this is that these two companies were in competition ten years ago also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=2349)|
| 0:39:19| When things were done by one of the companies that I didn't care for then, I don't care for now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=2359)|
| 0:39:28| and quite frankly, I don't particularly care for them being the ambulance service for Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=2368)|
| 0:39:35| So I'll call for the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=2375)|
| 0:39:40| Well, we've got several lights on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=2380)|
| 0:39:42| and some other points that I think need to be probably need to be made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=2382)|
| 0:39:47| Thank you, Mr. Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=2387)|
| 0:39:48| Go ahead with the lights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=2388)|
| 0:39:51| I think Mr. Shouse was the next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=2391)|
| 0:39:53| Go ahead, Mr. Shouse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=2393)|
| 0:39:54| Mine are fairly brief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=2394)|
| 0:39:58| Two thoughts arising from Commissioner Briggs' statements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=2398)|
| 0:40:02| The who pay, and I've heard different answers on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=2402)|
| 0:40:05| Who pays now in going forward on the new contract?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=2405)|
| 0:40:09| Who will be responsible for taking the engines around?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=2409)|
| 0:40:12| If I've heard it was TennCare or the management company Eats It.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=2412)|
| 0:40:17| Who pays for that now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=2417)|
| 0:40:19| Who would pay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=2419)|
| 0:40:21| Martha, or Dr. Buchanan, you can answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=2421)|
| 0:40:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=2423)|
| 0:40:24| Martha Buchanan, director of Knox County Department, 140 Dameron Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=2424)|
| 0:40:28| Mr. Shouse, in the current contract, as in the previous contract,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=2428)|
| 0:40:32| the services for the engine will be at the expense of the vendor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=2432)|
| 0:40:38| And all the vendors, the current vendors does that now and will continue to do that at their expense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=2438)|
| 0:40:44| There are some changes they've had to make to make up for that, but that's --it won't be TennCare.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=2444)|
| 0:40:49| It might be TennCare in 2014, but right now it won't be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=2449)|
| 0:40:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=2451)|
| 0:40:52| Yeah, TennCare, if they've got TennCare, they're really not indigent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=2452)|
| 0:40:55| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=2455)|
| 0:40:56| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=2456)|
| 0:40:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=2457)|
| 0:40:58| In theory, they're not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=2458)|
| 0:40:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=2459)|
| 0:41:00| And a relatively small amount of money, but in the scope of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=2460)|
| 0:41:02| But the 67,000 he referenced in fines, where does that go?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=2462)|
| 0:41:05| Does that just go back to the county?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=2465)|
| 0:41:09| I'll let Chris take that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=2469)|
| 0:41:13| Currently, it offsets the cost of the contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=2473)|
| 0:41:16| So what we would do is if our contract with Rural Metro was 660,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=2476)|
| 0:41:22| then we would offset the fees each month or each quarter that we make that payment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=2482)|
| 0:41:26| So it's like a --Excuse me, Chris.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=2486)|
| 0:41:28| I thought under the new contract there would be no offset.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=2488)|
| 0:41:33| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=2493)|
| 0:41:34| But current, there is the offset.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=2494)|
| 0:41:35| Under the old contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=2495)|
| 0:41:36| It would just come in as revenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=2496)|
| 0:41:38| It would just go in on the positive in the black side of the balance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=2498)|
| 0:41:41| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=2501)|
| 0:41:42| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=2502)|
| 0:41:43| One other thing to show that we do get something back out of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=2503)|
| 0:41:46| This was about four or five years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=2506)|
| 0:41:48| We were putting in a digital EKG system that could be transmitted to the emergency rooms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=2508)|
| 0:41:54| And the hospital systems each contributed in the neighborhood of $50,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=2514)|
| 0:41:59| We took some of the money that the county had received back in these fines from EMS.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=2519)|
| 0:42:05| And I believe that the ambulances kicked in some money, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=2525)|
| 0:42:10| But we did put this back into the health care system of the county with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=2530)|
| 0:42:15| It's not done every year like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=2535)|
| 0:42:16| but that was one year that several hundred thousand dollars combined was put back to, at least at that time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=2536)|
| 0:42:22| we had probably one of the most advanced systems in the country on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=2542)|
| 0:42:28| So some of that money does go back there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=2548)|
| 0:42:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=2552)|
| 0:42:33| Anything else, Mr. Shouts?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=2553)|
| 0:42:34| You're good?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=2554)|
| 0:42:35| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=2555)|
| 0:42:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=2556)|
| 0:42:37| Mr. Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=2557)|
| 0:42:38| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=2558)|
| 0:42:39| Matt Myers, would you come up here real quick?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=2559)|
| 0:42:50| Matt, I just wanted to personally thank you for what you did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=2570)|
| 0:42:53| You were in the trenches on this quite a bit, quite a bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=2573)|
| 0:42:58| I've served on other committees, insurance committees, and that you do the same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=2578)|
| 0:43:04| And your fairness in everything you approach is unapproachable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=2584)|
| 0:43:09| You do a really good job of keeping everything fair and keeping it for the taxpayers in mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=2589)|
| 0:43:15| And so nothing can be questioned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=2595)|
| 0:43:17| And I just want to know that I still back you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=2597)|
| 0:43:19| and I back the process and the leadership you have in letting Matt do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=2599)|
| 0:43:25| But I know, Matt, you're back there and we're talking to you a lot about this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=2605)|
| 0:43:29| but you're the one that goes behind the closed doors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=2609)|
| 0:43:32| You give the orders to the people making the decisions and stuff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=2612)|
| 0:43:35| and you make sure that it's done the correct way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=2615)|
| 0:43:38| So, as a citizen of Knox County, I thank you for your time consuming that you've put on this committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=2618)|
| 0:43:44| Thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=2624)|
| 0:43:46| And, Cynthia Moxley, I just want to thank you for your organization| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=2626)|
| 0:43:51| and what you have done in getting the facts straight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=2631)|
| 0:43:55| This has almost been a PR nightmare, what this has tried to have been turned into.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=2635)|
| 0:43:59| And the facts are what the facts were.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=2639)|
| 0:44:02| And I appreciate you coming out and just laying, guys and girls, here's what we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=2642)|
| 0:44:07| Here's what the facts are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=2647)|
| 0:44:08| And this is some misinformation and some accusations going back and forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=2648)|
| 0:44:12| But here's what the facts are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=2652)|
| 0:44:14| When we've got the facts, the decision is very easy to make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=2654)|
| 0:44:18| Commissioner Hammond, thank you for those questions that you had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=2658)|
| 0:44:21| And, Commissioner Briggs, thank you because that's what we want to know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=2661)|
| 0:44:24| and getting those facts and things out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=2664)|
| 0:44:28| And, Commissioner Brown, I'm ready to vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=2668)|
| 0:44:31| We've had the facts laid out here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=2671)|
| 0:44:33| It's a no contest with what we've got.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=2673)|
| 0:44:37| Okay, we're almost there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=2677)|
| 0:44:40| Mr. Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=2680)|
| 0:44:41| Yes, thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=2681)|
| 0:44:43| You know, I won't be able to be here next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=2683)|
| 0:44:47| And seeing the writing on the wall a little bit, I think the vote is going to occur in December.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=2687)|
| 0:44:53| And I'm okay with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=2693)|
| 0:44:54| I'd rather be here, but I'll be out of town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=2694)|
| 0:44:58| I do want to address a few issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=2698)|
| 0:45:00| You know, I'm one of those guys that gets to be an end user of this contract on a daily basis at my regular job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=2700)|
| 0:45:07| And so before this process began, Rob Webb and I have been discussing some issues that I have been brought to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=2707)|
| 0:45:16| And I can see that during the negotiation process, Hugh, and this is kind of to you and it's public,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=2716)|
| 0:45:24| during the negotiation process, there's some more discussion that needs to be had with times and staging| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=2724)|
| 0:45:30| and on-scene times, and we need to make sure that we're capturing those correctly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=2730)|
| 0:45:35| But with that being said, I hope that you'll engage me after the vote to discuss that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=2735)|
| 0:45:42| I've already, Rob and I had to break off talks with that because of the dead period,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=2742)|
| 0:45:47| and we did that for the integrity of the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=2747)|
| 0:45:51| But Rob and I have had discussions about staging and some other things that need to be addressed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=2751)|
| 0:45:56| whoever the provider is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=2756)|
| 0:45:58| It doesn't matter who the provider is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=2758)|
| 0:46:00| And capturing those correct times is essential to the process or the contract being fulfilled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=2760)|
| 0:46:06| So if you guys do vote for that next week, if you vote in rural metro,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=2766)|
| 0:46:12| then know that there's still some things that need to be discussed with Hugh,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=2772)|
| 0:46:18| between Hugh and rural metro that I'll bring forward to Hugh,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=2778)|
| 0:46:21| and I hope, Hugh, that you'll let me be a part of that process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=2781)|
| 0:46:23| Most definitely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=2783)|
| 0:46:24| And we have engaged rural metro in regard to the cooperation and collaboration moving forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=2784)|
| 0:46:32| So, yes, that's on the radar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=2792)|
| 0:46:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=2794)|
| 0:46:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=2795)|
| 0:46:36| Mr. McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=2796)|
| 0:46:39| So real quick here, and I'm going to ask an obvious question, but I'd like to get a, you know, just kind of a,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=2799)|
| 0:46:47| this whole, no, Hugh, this process was totally blind, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=2807)|
| 0:46:53| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=2813)|
| 0:46:54| And then a question for the law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=2814)|
| 0:46:58| I guess what I'm wondering, hearing, Brad kind of made me think about this, should we be voting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=2818)|
| 0:47:07| I'm ready to vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=2827)|
| 0:47:08| Let me say that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=2828)|
| 0:47:09| But should we be voting on Monday, or should we let the process?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=2829)|
| 0:47:18| At the end of the day, what I don't want is this thing to vote, and they get, you know, dragged through the mud.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=2838)|
| 0:47:25| So I would just ask your opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=2845)|
| 0:47:30| Mr. Chairman, if it's me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=2850)|
| 0:47:32| Please, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=2852)|
| 0:47:33| I'm going to paraphrase his, because I've got a similar question to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=2853)|
| 0:47:38| What happens if the county commission votes to approve this contract,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=2858)|
| 0:47:45| but the appeals process is still in progress, which it may very well be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=2865)|
| 0:47:49| Is that in the appeals process other than the ability of them to go to court?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=2869)|
| 0:47:55| In other words, let's say that it goes through the process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=2875)|
| 0:47:58| and the mayor says we're going to do something different, but we've already approved the contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=2878)|
| 0:48:03| They always have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=2883)|
| 0:48:04| I understand there's always the option to go to court, which is outside what we're doing here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=2884)|
| 0:48:14| Well, the way I would see it, if the mayor had a conflict with the county commission's ruling, he has one of two ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=2894)|
| 0:48:21| He could come back to the county commission and ask for reconsideration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=2901)|
| 0:48:26| or he could veto it and have to have a two-thirds override.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=2906)|
| 0:48:30| That would be one solution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=2910)|
| 0:48:33| The other solution would be, and here there's a conflict in this statement that I'm fixing to make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=2913)|
| 0:48:39| When I say let the process take its course,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=2919)|
| 0:48:42| and I don't know how well it's been vetted out to Commissioner McKenzie,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=2922)|
| 0:48:46| but there were some issues brought out about a CAD system, about some kind of communications between the two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=2926)|
| 0:48:54| And in the process, if that issue itself is significant enough to adversely affect the overall county program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=2934)|
| 0:49:04| or if it is extensive enough to cause financial damage to Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=2944)|
| 0:49:08| then you're following the process even if you voted it up or down today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=2948)|
| 0:49:13| But that would have to be the reason it would be voted up and down today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=2953)|
| 0:49:16| From my recommendation, you know, I would prefer that the appeals process go through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=2956)|
| 0:49:23| If the appeals process went through and it still is denied all the way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=2963)|
| 0:49:28| then they would still have an opportunity to go to court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=2968)|
| 0:49:32| Court would either rule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=2972)|
| 0:49:34| They would be ruling on how well we followed the process is the question at law most likely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=2974)|
| 0:49:40| And then they would probably require a redo of the appeals process if they thought something was wrong or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=2980)|
| 0:49:49| And the real question would be that we would have to deal with is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=2989)|
| 0:49:55| is this one of those exclusions due to adversely affecting county programs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=2995)|
| 0:50:03| or causing additional or extensive damage to Knox County?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=3003)|
| 0:50:07| And that's a question of fact that you all have to vote on in your own minds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=3007)|
| 0:50:12| and hearts as you evaluate what's before you today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=3012)|
| 0:50:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=3020)|
| 0:50:21| Mr. Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=3021)|
| 0:50:24| The question about the law I think has been answered by the law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=3024)|
| 0:50:30| I guess I'm a little, Hugh, we're getting ready to vote on a $60 million contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=3030)|
| 0:50:36| I hear Commissioner Enders say that if it's approved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=3036)|
| 0:50:39| there's some things that are going to have to be worked out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=3039)|
| 0:50:42| And you have said you're going to work that out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=3042)|
| 0:50:44| What are we talking about here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=3044)|
| 0:50:45| I don't want to vote on a $60 million contract and come back and find out that there were issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=3045)|
| 0:50:49| I mean, are there significant issues here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=3049)|
| 0:50:51| I mean, what are we talking about?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=3051)|
| 0:50:53| No, the issues are it's communication.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=3053)|
| 0:50:56| And those things were addressed by incorporation of rural metro's RFP into the contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=3056)|
| 0:51:05| And I have spoke to the senior management at rural metro| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=3065)|
| 0:51:08| and explained to them that they need to be more proactive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=3068)|
| 0:51:15| and engage some of the other stakeholders more proactively.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=3075)|
| 0:51:19| And they do a good job at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=3079)|
| 0:51:22| They have weekly meetings and monthly meetings and quarterly meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=3082)|
| 0:51:29| But during the award process, I explained to Rob Webb that that was on my radar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=3089)|
| 0:51:37| Those are things I'm going to be looking for, that kind of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=3097)|
| 0:51:42| I guess my last question is, can other ambulance companies operate in Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=3102)|
| 0:51:50| even though we give rural metro this contract?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=3110)|
| 0:51:54| It's my understanding they can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=3114)|
| 0:51:56| Yes, this is not an exclusive agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=3116)|
| 0:51:58| In regard to BLS, now the ALS for E911 calls, it is exclusive to this particular contractor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=3118)|
| 0:52:07| But for BLS, which is just standard transport, you know, from nursing home to hospital,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=3127)|
| 0:52:12| that kind of stuff for treatment, that is still permissible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=3132)|
| 0:52:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=3136)|
| 0:52:17| So, I mean, any of the other companies could come in if they met criteria| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=3137)|
| 0:52:20| and if they were licensed, I guess, and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=3140)|
| 0:52:22| You have a lot of process I'm sure you go through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=3142)|
| 0:52:24| I mean, this is not saying that no one else in Knox County can ever operate an ambulance service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=3144)|
| 0:52:28| They can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=3148)|
| 0:52:29| It's just that this contract provides for certain criteria and certain specifications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=3149)|
| 0:52:33| Yes, for 9-1-1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=3153)|
| 0:52:34| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=3154)|
| 0:52:35| Dr. Buchanan, did you want to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=3155)|
| 0:52:39| To allay your concerns about the tweaking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=3159)|
| 0:52:43| there is a provision in the contract for medical services review committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=3163)|
| 0:52:47| I don't think, I'm not sure if that's what it's called,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=3167)|
| 0:52:50| but it's a committee made up of stakeholders which,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=3170)|
| 0:52:53| acknowledging that there are things that have to be addressed periodically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=3173)|
| 0:52:57| and to bring a group of stakeholders together to do that within the contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=3177)|
| 0:53:01| So it's not major contract changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=3181)|
| 0:53:03| It's stuff like Commissioner Andrews was speaking of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=3183)|
| 0:53:06| staging and response times and protocols that are not specific to the contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=3186)|
| 0:53:13| Well, that helps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=3193)|
| 0:53:14| Because when I heard that, I, you know, a red flag went up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=3194)|
| 0:53:17| We're looking basically at a 15-year contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=3197)|
| 0:53:19| And so the fact that these, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=3199)|
| 0:53:21| that the stakeholders are going to be meeting on a regular basis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=3201)|
| 0:53:24| I like that idea, obviously, because over a 15-year period,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=3204)|
| 0:53:27| you need to make sure that you're working on the things that you need to work on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=3207)|
| 0:53:32| And currently a lot of that is done under Larry Hutzel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=3212)|
| 0:53:36| So we're kind of expanding that a little bit and bringing some other folks to the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=3216)|
| 0:53:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=3219)|
| 0:53:40| Mr. Chairman, I guess my final comment would be that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=3220)|
| 0:53:43| my concern was, was the process fair?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=3223)|
| 0:53:45| Did everyone get a fair shake?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=3225)|
| 0:53:47| I'm convinced that they did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=3227)|
| 0:53:49| I don't think that the doctor, Dr. Dobbs, I guess, I don't see that his integrity is in question at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=3229)|
| 0:53:58| I don't think that Mr. Hutzel, his integrity is in question here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=3238)|
| 0:54:02| I think he did what he was asked to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=3242)|
| 0:54:04| I don't see that there's any evidence that there was any wrongdoing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=3244)|
| 0:54:07| or that there was any kind of activity here that would have been,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=3247)|
| 0:54:11| that would cause us to not, that would cause me not to vote on this contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=3251)|
| 0:54:16| So I wanted to make that statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=3256)|
| 0:54:17| I guess my only concern is from a law standpoint,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=3257)|
| 0:54:19| but the law director has said that there are options should the mayor choose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=3259)|
| 0:54:23| He can come back to us and say, wait a minute, I think that we need to take another look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=3263)|
| 0:54:27| But there is a procedure for that in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=3267)|
| 0:54:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=3269)|
| 0:54:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=3270)|
| 0:54:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=3271)|
| 0:54:32| Mr. Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=3272)|
| 0:54:33| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=3273)|
| 0:54:34| Let me reiterate what I said a while ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=3274)|
| 0:54:35| I don't like doing business with people who are trying to throw a monkey wrench in the works and cry foul.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=3275)|
| 0:54:43| This appeals process could string out for two years if they chose to do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=3283)|
| 0:54:49| Mr. Coker says he has a deadline of December 19th to get this new program, you know, his bid okayed and passed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=3289)|
| 0:54:57| and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=3297)|
| 0:54:58| Rural Metro is ready to go with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=3298)|
| 0:55:00| Again, we have a company that has not caused us the kind of problems in throwing monkey wrenches into the fire| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=3300)|
| 0:55:10| or whatever every time something comes up and crying wolf.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=3310)|
| 0:55:15| So, again, I'll call for the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=3315)|
| 0:55:18| Okay, we've got one more light.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=3318)|
| 0:55:19| So let's let Mr. Andrews go since he has some expertise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=3319)|
| 0:55:23| Go ahead, Mr. Andrews.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=3323)|
| 0:55:24| I just wanted to address what Commissioner Hammond had spoken about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=3324)|
| 0:55:29| And what it was is the new technology allows us to record those times| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=3329)|
| 0:55:34| and to make sure that we're correct on all of our timing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=3334)|
| 0:55:36| And there was some, when Rural Metro moved from dispatch from the Campbell Station to 911,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=3336)|
| 0:55:41| that's really when the penalties coincided.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=3341)|
| 0:55:44| And so the technology has gotten better and we're doing better and the new CAD system will do better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=3344)|
| 0:55:48| I just want to make sure that we continue the process and the progress that we've made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=3348)|
| 0:55:52| It's not that there is overbearing issues, but it's gotten better| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=3352)|
| 0:55:56| and I want to make sure it continues to get better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=3356)|
| 0:56:01| Okay, lights are out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=3361)|
| 0:56:02| And I greatly appreciate the questioning that we have and the expertise,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=3362)|
| 0:56:07| the stakeholders that we have right here on this board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=3367)|
| 0:56:10| And in terms of Dr. Briggs and Mr. Andrews, of course, in their jobs, they are close to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=3370)|
| 0:56:18| And I think that bodes well for the selection process, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=3378)|
| 0:56:21| It adds to the validity and credibility of this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=3381)|
| 0:56:27| So I appreciate all of you all and all these questions and digging into the topic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=3387)|
| 0:56:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=3395)|

| 0:58:25| of the General Sessions Court to deliver a letter to the chair of the Knox County Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=3505)|
| 0:58:29| listing by name no less than four,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=3509)|
| 0:58:32| nor more than eight persons approved by a majority of the General Sessions judges for each of the three| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=3512)|
| 0:58:40| judicial magistrate seats expiring January 31, 2013, resolution 906.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=3520)|
| 0:58:46| Commissioner, this was necessary because of the holiday shift in shortness of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=3526)|
| 0:58:52| We could not get the 30-day notice in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=3532)|
| 0:58:54| So that's the reason why we are asking for the waiver.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=3534)|
| 0:58:58| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=3538)|

| 0:59:01| Motion to second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=3541)|
| 0:59:02| Mr. Hammond?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=3542)|
| 0:59:03| I just had a couple of questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=3543)|
| 0:59:04| So this will be on our January agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=3544)|
| 0:59:08| When they give us the four names, I'm just trying to jog my memory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=3548)|
| 0:59:12| Will they rank those or they just give us four names and then we'll go through an interview process, won't we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=3552)|
| 0:59:17| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=3557)|
| 0:59:18| We'll go through an interview process, but I don't think there's any ranking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=3558)|
| 0:59:21| It was a list of eligibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=3561)|
| 0:59:23| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=3563)|
| 0:59:24| It was a list of people that they would approve and not reject.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=3564)|
| 0:59:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=3567)|
| 0:59:28| So they approve this list that will be given.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=3568)|
| 0:59:31| But we will have a hearing and an interview process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=3571)|
| 0:59:33| And an interview process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=3573)|
| 0:59:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=3575)|
| 0:59:37| Other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=3577)|
| 0:59:38| All in favor say oh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=3578)|
| 0:59:40| Mr. Brown, did you have a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=3580)|
| 0:59:42| Well, just for information, there are three slots that are opening up January 31st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=3582)|
| 0:59:50| Mark Brown, Dennis Rowe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=3590)|
| 0:59:53| Harold Stewart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=3593)|
| 0:59:54| Chris Rowe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=3594)|
| 0:59:55| Chris Rowe, Harold Stewart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=3595)|
| 0:59:56| And Henry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=3596)|
| 0:59:57| Harold Stewart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=3597)|
| 0:59:58| Harold Stewart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=3598)|
| 0:59:59| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=3599)|
| 1:00:00| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=3600)|
| 1:00:01| Those three, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=3601)|
| 1:00:02| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=3602)|
| 1:00:03| Those three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=3603)|
| 1:00:06| They're up for reappointment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=3606)|
| 1:00:10| I hate to keep, you know, we have to put these out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=3610)|
| 1:00:12| but I don't want to discourage people from keep applying because, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=3612)|
| 1:00:18| I think we're only going to reappoint the good old boys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=3618)|
| 1:00:21| But, you know, if they're doing the job, normally that's probably going to be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=3621)|
| 1:00:24| But I just don't want to discourage people from trying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=3624)|
| 1:00:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=3627)|
| 1:00:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=3628)|
| 1:00:30| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=3630)|
| 1:00:31| The motion is to waive this requirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=3631)|
| 1:00:35| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=3635)|
| 1:00:36| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=3636)|
| 1:00:37| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=3637)|
| 1:00:38| Ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=3638)|
| 1:00:40| On Page 7, Item Number 24, a resolution amending the South County Sector Plan adopted by Resolution RZ-02-2-102| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=3640)|
| 1:00:53| on February 5th, 2002, Resolution 908.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=3653)|
| 1:00:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=3657)|
| 1:00:58| I wanted to bring this back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=3658)|
| 1:01:00| The commissioners today with an item to be considered as an amendment for the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=3660)|
| 1:01:08| So I'll let the law director, Mr. Sanders, Daniel Sanders, is here representing the law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=3668)|
| 1:01:21| And after some lengthy discussion about the sector plans and this process, of course,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=3681)|
| 1:01:27| we're trying with Mr. Donaldson and the MPC, of course,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=3687)|
| 1:01:31| we're trying to avoid bringing this up every time we have a sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=3691)|
| 1:01:36| We know some of the hurtful nature of saying ridgetop plan or hillside plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=3696)|
| 1:01:46| So we're trying to get by that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=3706)|
| 1:01:48| And this is the recommendation of the law director that if we do approve this as an amendment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=3708)|
| 1:01:55| then it would go back to MPC for their review and then back to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=3715)|
| 1:01:58| So go ahead, Mr. Sanders, give us our description of the amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=3718)|
| 1:02:03| Daniel Sanders, Knox County Law Director's Office for Main Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=3723)|
| 1:02:06| There are, as the South County Sector Plan was recommended by the Metropolitan Planning Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=3726)|
| 1:02:12| there are three pages that reference the hillside ridgetop protection plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=3732)|
| 1:02:21| And there was some concern on commission when this failed last month that there was uncertainty about the nature of the plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=3741)|
| 1:02:30| whether it was still advisory or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=3750)|
| 1:02:32| And what we suggest is on page 27, as it's outlined in your resolution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=3752)|
| 1:02:38| where the asterisk appears under the table to add language there in your resolution, so the asterisk would read,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=3758)|
| 1:02:49| please note that this is not a complete list of the policies from the Knox County Hillside Ridgetop Protection Plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=3769)|
| 1:02:56| as adopted by the County Commission Resolution 12A11SAP on January 23, 2011.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=3776)|
| 1:03:05| Now, that is the resolution that contained the so-called Briggs Amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=3785)|
| 1:03:11| and made clear that the hillside plan was advisory only.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=3791)|
| 1:03:17| So I hope that addresses the commission's concern about the nature of the plan, and I'll present that to the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=3797)|
| 1:03:25| You have the authority to amend the language that we've suggested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=3805)|
| 1:03:31| But I'll stand for questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=3811)|
| 1:03:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=3814)|
| 1:03:35| Thank you, Mr. Sanders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=3815)|
| 1:03:36| And, of course, the reasoning here is try to avoid this conflict.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=3816)|
| 1:03:42| It seems to keep cropping up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=3822)|
| 1:03:44| So go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=3824)|
| 1:03:47| We don't have a motion before us yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=3827)|
| 1:03:49| So let's start with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=3829)|
| 1:03:51| Mr. Smith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=3831)|
| 1:03:52| In light of what you've said, Daniel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=3832)|
| 1:03:54| I'll make a motion then to go ahead and pass it without recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=3834)|
| 1:03:58| So we'll have time to review this by Monday and look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=3838)|
| 1:04:01| If we get any questions, we'll get it with the law department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=3841)|
| 1:04:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=3843)|
| 1:04:04| So we've got a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=3844)|
| 1:04:05| No recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=3845)|
| 1:04:06| Do we have a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=3846)|
| 1:04:07| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=3847)|
| 1:04:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=3848)|
| 1:04:09| More lights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=3849)|
| 1:04:10| Mr. Anders?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=3850)|
| 1:04:11| I do appreciate Daniel looking into this on the law director's side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=3851)|
| 1:04:16| You know, I think he and I have come to the conclusion that my definition of advisory| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=3856)|
| 1:04:22| and MPC's definition of advisory is probably a little different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=3862)|
| 1:04:26| And although it shouldn't be, it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=3866)|
| 1:04:32| But I believe that, in my opinion, and it's not my law degree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=3872)|
| 1:04:40| But I do believe that putting this in the plan makes it actionable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=3880)|
| 1:04:46| And it gives MPC the authority and the power to do more than it should be on an advisory plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=3886)|
| 1:04:53| And, you know, as soon as we passed the hillside and ridgetop plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=3893)|
| 1:04:58| they started pulling out ordinances and talking about passing ordinances that everybody agreed with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=3898)|
| 1:05:07| You know, I should have known that was going to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=3907)|
| 1:05:10| I should have never agreed to the compromise because, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=3910)|
| 1:05:14| the good things in the plan we couldn't come together on because it was all or nothing for everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=3914)|
| 1:05:20| But when we put these in these sector plans and out of respect for the people in South Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=3920)|
| 1:05:25| and out of respect for Commissioner Brown and how he's advocated for this, I'll vote for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=3925)|
| 1:05:31| But the MPC is treading on thin ice when they start bringing us ordinances that have hillside| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=3931)|
| 1:05:37| and protection in them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=3937)|
| 1:05:38| And I'm just letting the commission know, once they put them in the plan, they're in the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=3938)|
| 1:05:42| And it gives them, state law gives them a little bit more authority than it would if it was not in the plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=3942)|
| 1:05:46| and sitting on the shelf as an advisory component.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=3946)|
| 1:05:49| But that's how I feel about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=3949)|
| 1:05:51| And it's not going to change my mind about how the ridgetop plan, being advisory,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=3951)|
| 1:05:56| should be a tool for mediation with development and good development and good planning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=3956)|
| 1:06:03| And it's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=3963)|
| 1:06:04| It's being used as a document to try to get it into the plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=3964)|
| 1:06:07| And I disagree with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=3967)|
| 1:06:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=3969)|
| 1:06:10| And there is some discussion about what is advisory and what is an interpretation of advisory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=3970)|
| 1:06:16| One of the things in our discussion, certainly with Mr. Donaldson, some of the MPC folks, that they're developers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=3976)|
| 1:06:24| or builders that are going to go into an area that is a hillside or ridgetop area, one advantage of this reference,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=3984)|
| 1:06:34| I see in the sector plan, in this amendment of the sector plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=3994)|
| 1:06:38| it does emphasize the fact that this is an area that is special in some way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=3998)|
| 1:06:46| And it doesn't, it's not going to shock them that, oh, here's something else that I've got to deal with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=4006)|
| 1:06:54| We're not trying to sneak something in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=4014)|
| 1:06:56| I don't think that's what we're trying to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=4016)|
| 1:06:59| I think we're trying to be very above board and give out the appropriate amount of information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=4019)|
| 1:07:05| and the appropriate amount of concern simultaneously for that kind of development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=4025)|
| 1:07:10| So I hope it's conducive to good development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=4030)|
| 1:07:13| That's what we think that these types of considerations do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=4033)|
| 1:07:18| Go ahead, Mr. Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=4038)|
| 1:07:21| I guess my question is, why do we even need this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=4041)|
| 1:07:24| I mean, if we've said it's advisory and we've all voted on it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=4044)|
| 1:07:27| and we know it's advisory, why do we need to put this language in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=4047)|
| 1:07:36| Are we creating, I mean, are we further muddying the water, so to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=4056)|
| 1:07:43| Mark Donaldson with the Metropolitan Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=4063)|
| 1:07:46| That's a question that I would ask as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=4066)|
| 1:07:50| I could direct you back to the paragraph that was added to the county's version of the Hillside| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=4070)|
| 1:07:56| and Ridgetop Protection Plan, the last sentence of which reads,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=4076)|
| 1:07:59| any comparable provisions of the Knoxville-Knox County General Plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=4079)|
| 1:08:03| or any sector plan which relate to hillside| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=4083)|
| 1:08:06| and ridgetop protections shall also be considered advisory consistent with this plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=4086)|
| 1:08:12| So we believe that it's perfectly clear that the provisions of the Hillside| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=4092)|
| 1:08:18| and Ridgetop Protection Plan are advisory, as are any recommendations of any elements of the General Plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=4098)|
| 1:08:27| But as users of plans, developers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=4107)|
| 1:08:33| and landowners are more likely to read the sector plans than any other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=4113)|
| 1:08:38| It is that plan that is amended the most often,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=4118)|
| 1:08:42| and it is that plan that contains the future land use map,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=4122)|
| 1:08:47| which is used as a guideline for rezoning considerations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=4127)|
| 1:08:53| So to have a sentence within the sector plan that refers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=4133)|
| 1:08:59| that says the same thing as the sentence in the Hillside and Ridgetop Protection Plan probably is a good thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=4139)|
| 1:09:05| because people are more likely to see it as a part of the sector plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=4145)|
| 1:09:10| than as a part of the Hillside and Ridgetop Protection Plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=4150)|
| 1:09:17| Okay, Mr. Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=4157)|
| 1:09:19| Daniel, how many times in this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=4159)|
| 1:09:21| I've not had a chance to look at this yet, what you're proposing here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=4161)|
| 1:09:24| We're using the word advisory, sort of like what Commissioner Anders is saying here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=4164)|
| 1:09:28| I mean, is it going to be mentioned several times or?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=4168)|
| 1:09:31| In the South County Sector Plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=4171)|
| 1:09:33| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=4173)|
| 1:09:34| I wouldn't know exactly how many times that word is used in the South County Sector Plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=4174)|
| 1:09:37| but it is, in my opinion anyway, that it would be incorporated by reference to the resolution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=4177)|
| 1:09:43| as it's suggested here in this resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=4183)|
| 1:09:47| And that, I do have a copy of that paragraph here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=4187)|
| 1:10:06| The word advisory is used twice in the opening paragraph of the Hillside and Ridgetop Protection Plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=4206)|
| 1:10:13| as amended by the county commission January 23, 2011.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=4213)|
| 1:10:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=4216)|
| 1:10:18| Dr. Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=4218)|
| 1:10:19| Yeah, I just wanted to make a comment on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=4219)|
| 1:10:22| And this was the, really the argument or the objections I had originally with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=4222)|
| 1:10:28| As long as we keep it advisory,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=4228)|
| 1:10:30| I don't disagree with what Chairman Norman said when he said that when this falls under one of the protected slopes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=4230)|
| 1:10:39| this is something that's going to be looked at differently than if it's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=4239)|
| 1:10:45| And I really don't have any objections if the Metropolitan Planning Commission says this is a special area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=4245)|
| 1:10:54| and we're going to treat it with our recommendation like the original slopes and hilltops plan suggested,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=4254)|
| 1:11:05| and not allow or recommend against the changing of zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=4265)|
| 1:11:11| What I want is if there is a compelling argument is that the appeal process passes back to the county commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=4271)|
| 1:11:17| so we can look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=4277)|
| 1:11:19| In other words, the plan's advisory, but it's not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=4279)|
| 1:11:22| it doesn't leave the sole arbitrator on whether someone can go forward with a zoning change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=4282)|
| 1:11:28| or a sector plan change or anything in the hands of the MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=4288)|
| 1:11:32| Likewise, if it's an area that the MPC decides to go the other way with it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=4292)|
| 1:11:40| is that a citizen or a citizen's group could come back and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=4300)|
| 1:11:45| and we want to appeal this to the county commission to say that we don't think this should go forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=4305)|
| 1:11:51| with what the MPC has recommended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=4311)|
| 1:11:55| And the reason for that, I think we all have to face the realities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=4315)|
| 1:11:58| is that we can have an MPC that is overly conservative or over liberal in what they do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=4318)|
| 1:12:07| And the checks and balances on that is to have an elected body,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=4327)|
| 1:12:10| which is the county commission, be the final arbitrator on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=4330)|
| 1:12:16| And that was my purpose of adding those three sentences,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=4336)|
| 1:12:20| which were amendment to the plan in the first place, just to make it absolutely clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=4340)|
| 1:12:25| I guess my question to the legal folks is this ordinance that's been proposed here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=4345)|
| 1:12:35| does this still allow that appeal process to occur to where we could change what the MPC's recommendation is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=4355)|
| 1:12:46| if we're really and truly making it advisory and not arbitrary?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=4366)|
| 1:12:53| This resolution does not change any of the rights of appeal that anyone would have under the zoning ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=4373)|
| 1:12:59| and the subdivision regulations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=4379)|
| 1:13:01| and the other methods of appeal that a property owner or a member of the community might have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=4381)|
| 1:13:09| And, you know, and just as a final comment is, and it always makes me uncomfortable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=4389)|
| 1:13:15| you know, we're always, I'm not afraid if there's legal action,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=4395)|
| 1:13:18| but where there's two different interpretations of the word advisory,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=4398)|
| 1:13:22| I think that is a setup for something to be, have to be defined by the courts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=4402)|
| 1:13:29| And if we can avoid that, I think we should.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=4409)|
| 1:13:31| You know, I'll have to leave that up to you all's opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=4411)|
| 1:13:35| It's still, you know, nothing's guaranteed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=4415)|
| 1:13:38| That's why we have courts and we have opinions because there's difference of opinions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=4418)|
| 1:13:42| But that's the other thing that I'd like to avoid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=4422)|
| 1:13:44| If we can make it clear enough what advisory really means, you know, for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=4424)|
| 1:13:50| You know, I don't know if it does or doesn't, but just as Commissioner Andrews said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=4430)|
| 1:13:55| is that there does seem to be a variance even between us and maybe the MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=4435)|
| 1:14:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=4441)|
| 1:14:02| That's all I had to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=4442)|
| 1:14:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=4443)|
| 1:14:05| And nothing else from me in terms of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=4445)|
| 1:14:07| I know it's an area of concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=4447)|
| 1:14:10| Last week in a chamber meeting, the Government Relations Committee had as a bullet point an emphasis on the fact that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=4450)|
| 1:14:19| or the need for us legislatively to emphasize that the Hillside Rooftop Plan was advisory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=4459)|
| 1:14:26| And I said, without a doubt, the commission has spoken clearly on this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=4466)|
| 1:14:32| It is advisory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=4472)|
| 1:14:34| The language of the paragraph of the amended Dr. Briggs paragraph clearly states that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=4474)|
| 1:14:41| That's our intent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=4481)|
| 1:14:42| And so other than putting an electronic message center up there on the water tower or something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=4482)|
| 1:14:48| and scrolling it across that it's advisory, I don't know what else we can do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=4488)|
| 1:14:53| But we're trying to emphasize that in the document now so we can go forward with sector plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=4493)|
| 1:15:03| I think that's, of course, from the law director, this is the way to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=4503)|
| 1:15:08| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=4508)|
| 1:15:09| So we have a motion for no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=4509)|
| 1:15:13| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=4513)|
| 1:15:15| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=4515)|
| 1:15:16| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=4516)|
| 1:15:17| We'll take that up again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=4517)|
| 1:15:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=4519)|

| 1:16:26| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=4586)|
| 1:16:27| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=4587)|
| 1:16:28| I had a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=4588)|
| 1:16:29| Do we have somebody from engineering here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=4589)|
| 1:16:31| Is Parsi here or Dwight?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=4591)|
| 1:16:33| Dwight, you're still here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=4593)|
| 1:16:35| Sorry to bother you there, Dwight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=4595)|
| 1:16:43| When we get into this designation from the state called the Qualified Local Program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=4603)|
| 1:16:51| what is that going to do to you from a management standpoint| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=4611)|
| 1:16:57| or additional burden on your stormwater department?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=4617)|
| 1:17:04| At this point, Mr. Chairman, I don't think it will mean any additional work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=4624)|
| 1:17:08| Essentially, we issue redundant permits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=4628)|
| 1:17:12| Obviously, applicants come in and get a permit from the state into the state CGP through TDEC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=4632)|
| 1:17:19| and then they come in and get a permit from Knox County for their development as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=4639)|
| 1:17:25| What it will do is it will eliminate that redundancy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=4645)|
| 1:17:28| and it will permit us to begin to assess a permit fee either equivalent to or less than,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=4648)|
| 1:17:37| preferably, that which the state assesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=4657)|
| 1:17:40| At this point in time, we do not charge for our permits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=4660)|
| 1:17:43| That cost is just borne by the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=4663)|
| 1:17:46| When applicants come in and they're no longer getting redundant permits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=4666)|
| 1:17:50| it does seem to us that charging an equivalent fee or a slightly smaller fee than TDEC does would be in order to help| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=4670)|
| 1:17:57| offset those costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=4677)|
| 1:17:58| But I don't think it means anything to us in terms of additional labor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=4678)|
| 1:18:01| It certainly doesn't mean anything to us in terms of additional inspections or anything of that nature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=4681)|
| 1:18:06| So the development community ought to be well pleased with this adjustment also from their standpoint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=4686)|
| 1:18:13| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=4693)|
| 1:18:14| The body of standards that TDEC enforces| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=4694)|
| 1:18:16| and the body of standards that we enforce are both known quantities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=4696)|
| 1:18:19| They're going to just deal with one regulatory agency instead of two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=4699)|

| 1:18:52| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=4732)|
| 1:18:53| All in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=4733)|
| 1:18:54| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=4734)|
| 1:18:55| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=4735)|
| 1:18:56| Ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=4736)|
| 1:18:58| Item number 29,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=4738)|
| 1:19:00| discussion regarding the proposed amendments to the Knox County zoning ordinance regarding the regulation of signs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=4740)|
| 1:19:06| billboards, electronic message pad centers, and other advertising structures in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=4746)|
| 1:19:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=4753)|
| 1:19:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=4754)|
| 1:19:16| Mr. Sanders, will you come again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=4756)|
| 1:19:19| And I'm just putting this on there on the agenda to keep the topic warm before we vote on it in January.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=4759)|
| 1:19:29| There was one issue that came before us in the workshop that had to do with property rights,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=4769)|
| 1:19:36| and it was related to swap provisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=4776)|
| 1:19:40| And there was some question about Tennessee state law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=4780)|
| 1:19:44| and whether our law would prevent that type of activity from taking place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=4784)|
| 1:19:51| There was maybe an inference that it possibly would or could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=4791)|
| 1:19:57| Could you respond to at least to that and to anything else that you think is important right now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=4797)|
| 1:20:04| Daniel Sanders, Knox County Law Director's Office, 400 Main Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=4804)|
| 1:20:09| Commissioner Hammond requested a legal memorandum on the swap programs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=4809)|
| 1:20:15| including an analysis of our grandfather provision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=4815)|
| 1:20:20| Research on that is ongoing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=4820)|
| 1:20:22| I will tease and say that I've done some research, found some swap programs that I think are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=4822)|
| 1:20:32| you know, amenable to application here in Knox County if the commission so desires.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=4832)|
| 1:20:38| And the essential elements of those swap programs are, one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=4838)|
| 1:20:44| a cap on the number of billboards in the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=4844)|
| 1:20:47| and then a process by which a sign owner could either convert a traditional billboard to an electronic billboard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=4847)|
| 1:20:55| or move a traditional billboard to a new location in exchange for a number of existing billboards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=4855)|
| 1:21:03| So with the swap program, you would reduce the number of total billboards in the county by a percentage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=4863)|
| 1:21:11| or a fraction, whatever number that you were able to negotiate with interested parties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=4871)|
| 1:21:18| With regard to the grandfather provision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=4878)|
| 1:21:21| Tennessee has one of the strongest grandfather provisions in the country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=4881)|
| 1:21:26| It does create rights specifically for outdoor advertising sign owners and property owners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=4886)|
| 1:21:36| The second element of one of these swap programs would be the process to reduce the signs in exchange for relocation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=4896)|
| 1:21:43| or conversion, and the property owners and the sign owners would have to be involved in that process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=4903)|
| 1:21:50| and execute waivers and agreements with the county in order to facilitate the process of conversion or relocation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=4910)|
| 1:22:00| I don't see an absolute bar that the grandfather provision would present to one of these programs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=4920)|
| 1:22:06| at least the essential elements of the program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=4926)|
| 1:22:09| It will have to be a negotiation between multiple parties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=4929)|
| 1:22:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=4933)|
| 1:22:14| Could be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=4934)|
| 1:22:15| You think it could be done, given where we are?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=4935)|
| 1:22:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=4939)|
| 1:22:20| Mr. Owenby.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=4940)|
| 1:22:22| Yeah, I agree with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=4942)|
| 1:22:25| I'm not a lawyer, but you are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=4945)|
| 1:22:28| I have been studying a lot of this lately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=4948)|
| 1:22:32| You would have to involve the property rights, the property owners themselves, because they own the structure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=4952)|
| 1:22:37| They own the piece of property that it sits on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=4957)|
| 1:22:40| So you can't just swap and say, okay, if you want to do a digital, you've got to take down three| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=4960)|
| 1:22:46| because then you have to involve three property owners and get them to sign off because you can't take their rights away| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=4966)|
| 1:22:53| from their own property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=4973)|
| 1:22:55| So that's the reason I think it will be a little harder to do the swap and replace than if we were in another state, probably.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=4975)|
| 1:23:04| Here we wouldn't be able to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=4984)|
| 1:23:06| Difficult, not impossible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=4986)|
| 1:23:08| That's true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=4988)|
| 1:23:09| Difficult.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=4989)|
| 1:23:10| Very.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=4990)|
| 1:23:12| And the responsibility is there with the company, with the industry,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=4992)|
| 1:23:17| and with those property owners to solve that problem if we went that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=4997)|
| 1:23:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=5003)|
| 1:23:24| And that could be worked out according to the law director and to MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=5004)|
| 1:23:30| Dr. Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=5010)|
| 1:23:34| My understanding was that it could be a little bit more complex than that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=5014)|
| 1:23:39| because you could have a present property owner that has the right or has the license| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=5019)|
| 1:23:44| or whatever the permit to put a billboard on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=5024)|
| 1:23:48| A company could buy out that right and they could take the billboard down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=5028)|
| 1:23:53| The right to have the billboard is with the property and not with the owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=5033)|
| 1:23:58| And if the property is sold, then the new property owner still has that right to put it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=5038)|
| 1:24:06| And so, really, the right goes with the property and not the owner, although an owner can,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=5046)|
| 1:24:11| as long as he's on the property, it's sort of like being from Kentucky originally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=5051)|
| 1:24:16| It's like the old tobacco base was, is that it goes with the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=5056)|
| 1:24:20| And someone could then put a billboard back up after the property was sold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=5060)|
| 1:24:25| So the swap is only valid as long as the property owner has the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=5065)|
| 1:24:32| And my understanding is also that in some of these places where the swaps has, you know, have occurred,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=5072)|
| 1:24:39| is you, you know, you run into a problem where some of the property owners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=5079)|
| 1:24:47| and maybe even some of the other billboard companies who have been swapped out can lose some of those rights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=5087)|
| 1:24:54| And the large companies have an advantage over the smaller companies when some of that occurs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=5094)|
| 1:25:04| And my understanding is there's been litigation involved in a lot of those places where the swaps have occurred.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=5104)|
| 1:25:12| And I don't know if you would have a chance to research.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=5112)|
| 1:25:16| I'm not trying to throw it all on you right now, but research some of that about who, you know, where does the right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=5116)|
| 1:25:21| is the right with the permit holder, which would, you know, which would, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=5121)|
| 1:25:28| he could deal that away to a larger company, or is the right with the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=5128)|
| 1:25:33| which as the property is sold, that right, the owner of the permit doesn't, you know, doesn't void that right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=5133)|
| 1:25:43| We'll address that in the legal memo, and I anticipate having that to the commission before the holidays.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=5143)|
| 1:25:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=5151)|
| 1:25:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=5152)|
| 1:25:53| Thank you, Mr. Sanders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=5153)|
| 1:25:54| Any other questions for Mr. Sanders?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=5154)|
| 1:25:57| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=5157)|
| 1:25:58| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=5158)|
| 1:25:59| Item number 30 is discussion regarding the make-up of the task force to consider expanding the number of commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=5159)|
| 1:26:06| Mr. Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=5166)|
| 1:26:07| Yes, I just wanted to bring this up for discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=5167)|
| 1:26:10| When we left this, it was probably a bit vague, and with the editorial that came out in the new sentinel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=5170)|
| 1:26:17| it prompted some questions to me and some phone calls about, well, how is this task force going to be made up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=5177)|
| 1:26:22| Who's going to be on it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=5182)|
| 1:26:23| Is it just going to be commissioners?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=5183)|
| 1:26:25| Are you going to involve the public, et cetera?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=5185)|
| 1:26:27| I don't have any answers to these, but I wanted to bring it up for discussion today to see what the feeling of the body was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=5187)|
| 1:26:34| My sense is that we probably need to formalize this task force just a bit to say how many people are going to be on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=5194)|
| 1:26:41| Are we going to involve people outside the commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=5201)|
| 1:26:44| I just think we need to have this discussion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=5204)|
| 1:26:46| and I'm prepared to send this on to maybe the chairman's lunch on Monday or to another forum,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=5206)|
| 1:26:51| but I just wanted to bring this up to say I think that we need to probably talk about this a little more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=5211)|
| 1:26:55| and formalize the structure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=5215)|
| 1:26:57| I believe that Mr. Wright needs to chair this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=5217)|
| 1:26:59| but I think that we need to give him some direction on how we need to proceed with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=5219)|
| 1:27:03| That's my thought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=5223)|
| 1:27:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=5224)|
| 1:27:05| Any other comments about it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=5225)|
| 1:27:07| I'll be glad to put it on the chairman's lunch agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=5227)|
| 1:27:11| We can take it up then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=5231)|
| 1:27:12| Is that satisfactory?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=5232)|
| 1:27:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=5234)|
| 1:27:15| That's what we'll do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=5235)|
| 1:27:16| Anything else right now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=5236)|
| 1:27:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=5238)|
| 1:27:19| Mr. McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=5239)|
| 1:27:20| Well, I guess just kind of in line with that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=5240)|
| 1:27:26| more than just make them and I'm sure that's what Commissioner Hammond was saying as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=5246)|
| 1:27:29| You know, just the whole structure behind it, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=5249)|
| 1:27:34| I would like to get before we move too far out on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=5254)|
| 1:27:39| I'd like to get a good understanding on what we're talking about in terms of, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=5259)|
| 1:27:45| legal ramifications, cost ramifications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=5265)|
| 1:27:48| I'd like to just get our arms around it before we move out too far, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=5268)|
| 1:27:56| with a little guidance but not a whole lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=5276)|
| 1:27:58| I don't want to hog tie anyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=5278)|
| 1:28:00| But at the same time, this is a pretty significant thing we're talking about moving forward with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=5280)|
| 1:28:04| So I just did just for Monday's discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=5284)|
| 1:28:07| I mean, I think we need some real digging in on this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=5287)|
| 1:28:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=5293)|
| 1:28:14| So Monday's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=5294)|
| 1:28:15| We'll start digging then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=5295)|
| 1:28:18| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=5298)|
| 1:28:19| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=5299)|
| 1:28:20| Just one comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=5300)|
| 1:28:21| Oh, go ahead, Mr. Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=5301)|
| 1:28:22| I did get a phone call about a week ago from a gentleman who said that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=5302)|
| 1:28:28| commissioners only work four or five hours a month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=5308)|
| 1:28:34| Then you should run.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=5314)|
| 1:28:37| Tell him to come see me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=5317)|
| 1:28:40| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=5320)|
| 1:28:41| Let's have a ride along.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=5321)|
| 1:28:44| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=5324)|
| 1:28:45| Item 31, discussion regarding the formation of an education committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=5325)|
| 1:28:52| Commissioners, this was we've had parts of this discussed a couple of times all the way back into September| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=5332)|
| 1:29:01| and when we were doing some discussion of a survey and so on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=5341)|
| 1:29:07| My intent with the education committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=5347)|
| 1:29:10| and I was unaware of some statutory requirements that we've been remiss in in terms of our legislative body| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=5350)|
| 1:29:19| and what we're required to do from a financial standpoint,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=5359)|
| 1:29:23| financial information that we exchange from our director of schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=5363)|
| 1:29:30| And so I'm going to let the law director go over that in just a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=5370)|
| 1:29:35| But the reason, you know, my initial reason for even discussing an education committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=5375)|
| 1:29:44| in the process of doing committee formation was to try to promote a process that was a little less combative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=5384)|
| 1:29:56| or conflictive in terms of what we went through last year with the proposed tax increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=5396)|
| 1:30:02| So if we could get something going a little earlier and start talking about budgets earlier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=5402)|
| 1:30:10| I was hopeful that we wouldn't have that conflagration that we ended up with in April or May last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=5410)|
| 1:30:19| So that was really the initial requirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=5419)|
| 1:30:22| When I started also there was immediately I did have several people from the schools area start to talk about a joint committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=5422)|
| 1:30:36| So I started to inquire with CTAS and some other metropolitan areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=5436)|
| 1:30:41| This is a committee that we're going to have, this committee, which I envision now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=5441)|
| 1:30:48| which addresses financial issues in our statutory requirement in terms of school finances,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=5448)|
| 1:30:56| which we're going to cite here from TCA in just a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=5456)|
| 1:31:02| This is not, this can't be a joint committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=5462)|
| 1:31:05| This is a committee of commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=5465)|
| 1:31:07| Now, our discussion and this discussion will proceed and we'll see how we want to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=5467)|
| 1:31:13| But it could, you know, it could be a subcommittee of this committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=5473)|
| 1:31:16| It could, we'll decide how we want to form the committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=5476)|
| 1:31:21| But we're just in the discussion aspect right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=5481)|
| 1:31:24| And so CTAS, by the way, did not, there are no joint committees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=5484)|
| 1:31:32| Usually it's a committee of four or five commissioners that represent the whole commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=5492)|
| 1:31:40| that review finances on a quarterly basis of the school district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=5500)|
| 1:31:46| So that's where we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=5506)|
| 1:31:49| And I would like for the, this sort of, you're always rubbing up against the order of compromise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=5509)|
| 1:31:57| Hopefully it's, we can, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=5517)|
| 1:32:00| we're not going to be in violation of that according to our requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=5520)|
| 1:32:05| And so I'm going to let, I'd like for the law director to also give us some advice about such a education committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=5525)|
| 1:32:16| slash education finance committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=5536)|
| 1:32:20| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=5540)|
| 1:32:23| This issue came up when the chairman was looking for an education committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=5543)|
| 1:32:29| and in doing the research for what the committee could be about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=5549)|
| 1:32:35| we identified what used to be done with the intergovernmental committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=5555)|
| 1:32:41| and the finance committee formally under the old commission when we had those two distinct committees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=5561)|
| 1:32:47| There were statutory requirements of each of those committees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=5567)|
| 1:32:50| one looking at the overall operations of the appropriation, how the school was doing, that kind of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=5570)|
| 1:32:57| This is not a run the school issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=5577)|
| 1:33:01| This is an information exchange where county commission knows how the school is doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=5581)|
| 1:33:06| Are they achieving their goals?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=5586)|
| 1:33:08| Is the money appropriated satisfactory?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=5588)|
| 1:33:11| You know, just basically what's going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=5591)|
| 1:33:15| And then the finance committee requirement comes into play.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=5595)|
| 1:33:19| Is the money being spent, you know, to address the goals that they're doing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=5599)|
| 1:33:23| So historically we had those two committees in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=5603)|
| 1:33:27| Under this new commission we have neither committee in place, and really it is a mandamus duty of commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=5607)|
| 1:33:36| and would also probably avert, how's the word,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=5616)|
| 1:33:45| budgetary issues being, you know, a surprise to commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=5625)|
| 1:33:49| because this helps the two bodies work toward planning a budget all along the way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=5629)|
| 1:33:55| And then when it comes budget time, everybody should be close to being on the same page of what can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=5635)|
| 1:34:00| and cannot be done when the school board submits a budget to county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=5640)|
| 1:34:04| But it is the duties of the county legislative body to have a county board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=5644)|
| 1:34:11| a committee to work with the Board of Education in terms of the receipts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=5651)|
| 1:34:16| and expenditures for the county elementary and high schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=5656)|
| 1:34:21| and the progress and development and other information along those lines as to how schools are being run.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=5661)|
| 1:34:27| And at the same time to require the finance committee piece that we used to have to keep up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=5667)|
| 1:34:33| with an accounting of the use of expenditures that have been appropriated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=5673)|
| 1:34:38| This is in no way to be in conflict of who runs the schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=5678)|
| 1:34:46| This is in preparation of further funding and further appropriations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=5686)|
| 1:34:52| So that was the intent, I believe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=5692)|
| 1:34:54| the state legislature when they assigned these duties to commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=5694)|
| 1:34:57| and it would fit in with what the chairman was originally talking about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=5697)|
| 1:35:02| because his purpose was to work with the school board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=5702)|
| 1:35:06| and to try to gain a relationship where we could have budgetary issues in advance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=5706)|
| 1:35:14| So, anyway, you're required to have basically a committee to deal with the operations report receiving| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=5714)|
| 1:35:22| and a committee to deal with the finance report receiving from the director of schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=5722)|
| 1:35:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=5729)|
| 1:35:30| Thank you, Mr. Law Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=5730)|
| 1:35:31| And Ms. Rosberg had run off a copy of our duties there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=5731)|
| 1:35:36| You've got that with the highlighted a couple of items there, bullet point two and three on that page.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=5736)|
| 1:35:42| And we can talk about this, of course, again we will on Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=5742)|
| 1:35:47| But, Mr. Hammond, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=5747)|
| 1:35:50| I guess, Mr. Law Director, I'm confused.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=5750)|
| 1:35:55| The lawsuit that was settled and the settlement that we have with the Board of Education basically said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=5755)|
| 1:36:05| you know, we passed the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=5765)|
| 1:36:07| You have a budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=5767)|
| 1:36:08| You can expend those funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=5768)|
| 1:36:09| We can't really tell you what to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=5769)|
| 1:36:11| Now, as I read this, it would seem to me that there is a discrepancy here in the lawsuit settlement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=5771)|
| 1:36:23| because it says that we can ask questions, we are required to ask questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=5783)|
| 1:36:30| and if we don't, we're shirking our responsibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=5790)|
| 1:36:33| So, you know, I kind of liken the county commission and the school board right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=5793)|
| 1:36:37| between the U.S. House and the U.S. Senate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=5797)|
| 1:36:39| It's kind of in a stalemate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=5799)|
| 1:36:41| I kind of feel like that maybe is where we are now, and I don't like being in that position,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=5801)|
| 1:36:45| and I don't want to do anything that's going to create more angst between these two bodies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=5805)|
| 1:36:50| because I'm one of those that feels that we need to work together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=5810)|
| 1:36:53| But in looking at this, I see some potential here for that tension to increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=5813)|
| 1:36:59| Am I not reading this correctly, or what's your feeling on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=5819)|
| 1:37:03| Well, the tension would only increase if we allow it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=5823)|
| 1:37:07| One thing that I think that this body hasn't had clear in terms of the order of compromise,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=5827)|
| 1:37:16| the order of compromise basically makes the statement that the Knox County Board of Education| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=5836)|
| 1:37:21| has exclusive right to run the school systems for the county, and that they do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=5841)|
| 1:37:26| And this statute has nothing to do with the running, you know, who's going to be principal?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=5846)|
| 1:37:32| Who's going to go where?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=5852)|
| 1:37:33| How are we going to do our schools?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=5853)|
| 1:37:34| What kind of books?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=5854)|
| 1:37:35| You know, nothing to do with the running of the schools day to day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=5855)|
| 1:37:39| The other component of the order of compromise dealt with the law department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=5859)|
| 1:37:43| and who and who would pay for what and, you know, if there was a conflict between the two bodies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=5863)|
| 1:37:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=5868)|
| 1:37:49| Another thing that is really the consent item had to do with contracts and pre-appropriated dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=5869)|
| 1:37:56| The dollars that this body has actually appropriated and when the school board sends a contract in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=5876)|
| 1:38:03| the evaluation of that contract takes twofold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=5883)|
| 1:38:06| One is the money available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=5886)|
| 1:38:07| That comes from the mayor's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=5887)|
| 1:38:09| Two is it in legal form.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=5889)|
| 1:38:11| That comes from the law director's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=5891)|
| 1:38:14| And then you either sign those contracts by consent by the order of compromise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=5894)|
| 1:38:24| So your compromise is in the area of contracts and pre-appropriated money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=5904)|
| 1:38:30| It also has to do with signing of checks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=5910)|
| 1:38:32| and the relationship with the signing of checks and the executive branch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=5912)|
| 1:38:38| It also gave a position on the investment committee that they would have a representation from the school board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=5918)|
| 1:38:43| on the investment committee itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=5923)|
| 1:38:47| In that particular suit, the trustee was also a party.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=5927)|
| 1:38:51| They were dismissed in that suit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=5931)|
| 1:38:54| It also prohibited the board from having to maintain a contra account| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=5934)|
| 1:39:00| and use monies for external uses, you know, like with KCDC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=5940)|
| 1:39:05| or things that weren't directly associated with the schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=5945)|
| 1:39:10| And then the rest of it had to do with failure to comply and who would pay and that kind of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=5950)|
| 1:39:15| So the real compromise between the Board of Education| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=5955)|
| 1:39:19| and this body basically had to do with the Board of Education has the mandibus duty to run| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=5959)|
| 1:39:25| and operate the schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=5965)|
| 1:39:27| Once the money is appropriated, it's in their venue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=5967)|
| 1:39:32| The only that the contracts were basically mandibus, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=5972)|
| 1:39:38| when the board votes on something and it comes back by statute and charter, you have to approve contracts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=5978)|
| 1:39:44| You agree to approve their contracts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=5984)|
| 1:39:47| That's what you agreed to in the order of compromise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=5987)|
| 1:39:51| The rest of it got convoluted over time when people were talking about what the compromise was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=5991)|
| 1:39:57| The statute itself is not in conflict with that compromise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=5997)|
| 1:40:01| It is the responsibility of the commission to do what the statute says.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=6001)|
| 1:40:08| And this is information that the director gives the board, the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=6008)|
| 1:40:14| This is not information the board used to run the schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=6014)|
| 1:40:19| That's for the board to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=6019)|
| 1:40:21| They run their fiduciary duty to make sure that what you've appropriated is being spent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=6021)|
| 1:40:26| and that it's being spent for what you say it is being spent for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=6026)|
| 1:40:31| And that's what the two statutory elements undertake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=6031)|
| 1:40:38| It gives the opportunity for communications to flow freely between the board, the body of the education| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=6038)|
| 1:40:45| and the funding body, this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=6045)|
| 1:40:48| And I don't see that it has a —that it impacts the order of compromise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=6048)|
| 1:40:55| because they still have the absolute right to run the schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=6055)|
| 1:40:58| But you have a fiduciary duty to ensure that the money that is appropriated is being spent to run the schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=6058)|
| 1:41:06| and that the schools are performing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=6066)|
| 1:41:08| And that's where I think we have an opportunity as a community for the funding body| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=6068)|
| 1:41:13| to communicate with the delivery system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=6073)|
| 1:41:16| And so, really, the most strict area of the compromise is the Board of Education runs the schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=6076)|
| 1:41:26| Contracts are to be reviewed only in legal form and availability of funds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=6086)|
| 1:41:30| and approved by county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=6090)|
| 1:41:33| And that's really what the order of compromise deals with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=6093)|
| 1:41:35| The rest of it is, you know, who signs —who gets approval for checks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=6095)|
| 1:41:41| If there's a conflict, who pays for it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=6101)|
| 1:41:43| If there's legal fees, who does it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=6103)|
| 1:41:45| The board can only use the money for educational purposes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=6105)|
| 1:41:48| Have you had a conversation with the schools about this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=6108)|
| 1:41:51| Not yet because this just came up this week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=6111)|
| 1:41:55| I would like to have —you know, I believe if you sit down and talk, you can work things out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=6115)|
| 1:42:00| I'd like to have some opportunity to sit down and talk with the school board about this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=6120)|
| 1:42:04| so that we don't get into this thing of being appearing to have a hammer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=6124)|
| 1:42:07| that we're just, you know, coming in and using to —for clout purposes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=6127)|
| 1:42:12| I don't think that sends the right message.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=6132)|
| 1:42:15| I'm in favor of, you know, having a committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=6135)|
| 1:42:17| I applaud Commissioner Norman for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=6137)|
| 1:42:20| But in reading through this, and this is the first time I've seen this, I can see some issues here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=6140)|
| 1:42:24| And I don't know that we really want to do that because I think that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=6144)|
| 1:42:28| we just got through having a retreat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=6148)|
| 1:42:30| We've all agreed where we want to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=6150)|
| 1:42:31| And I think we've maybe strained that a little bit through the budget matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=6151)|
| 1:42:34| But I think that we can get back on track.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=6154)|
| 1:42:36| And I would hate to see this as something that could be used to perhaps derail that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=6156)|
| 1:42:41| I guess the other thing that I would ask you about is item number four,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=6161)|
| 1:42:44| even though it's not highlighted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=6164)|
| 1:42:46| It says submit to the voters of the county bonding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=6166)|
| 1:42:51| I don't really understand that one when it says we are required to submit to the voters| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=6171)|
| 1:42:59| at a regular session or special session proposition to issue bonds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=6179)|
| 1:43:03| for the purchase of purchasing grounds, erecting and furnishing school buildings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=6183)|
| 1:43:06| and upon the affirmative vote of the majority cast in the election,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=6186)|
| 1:43:09| issue the bonds in accordance with the proposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=6189)|
| 1:43:12| Could you look, maybe not today, but could we have a little bit of clarification on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=6192)|
| 1:43:17| Because just in reading that first blush, it's kind of like, oh, my goodness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=6197)|
| 1:43:22| Let's take a look at that and see exactly what this says| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=6202)|
| 1:43:24| and what it means because I really don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=6204)|
| 1:43:27| I'd be glad to take care of that for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=6207)|
| 1:43:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=6208)|
| 1:43:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=6211)|
| 1:43:32| Any other discussion here of this item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=6212)|
| 1:43:36| We'll have some more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=6216)|
| 1:43:37| This will be some food for thought during the week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=6217)|
| 1:43:42| I'm sure some people will have some questions and comments about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=6222)|
| 1:43:46| And we'll reconsider, you know, composition of this possible, this committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=6226)|
| 1:43:54| this finance slash educational finance committee and see where it goes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=6234)|
| 1:44:00| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=6240)|
| 1:44:01| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=6241)|
| 1:44:03| Item number 32 is discussion to schedule a joint county commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=6243)|
| 1:44:08| and city council workshop regarding a safety center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=6248)|
| 1:44:11| This is item 32.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=6251)|
| 1:44:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=6255)|
| 1:44:16| Mr. Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=6256)|
| 1:44:18| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=6258)|
| 1:44:20| You know, a couple of years ago we had this discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=6260)|
| 1:44:22| and it kind of went by the wayside, too expensive, whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=6262)|
| 1:44:28| But sometimes you come to a point where you've got to look at it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=6268)|
| 1:44:31| and say it may be too expensive now, but it might be disastrous later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=6271)|
| 1:44:40| Now, you all get this report every month from our auditor showing the number of prisoners out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=6280)|
| 1:44:48| In the last couple, three years, it's gone up on a daily average from low 900s| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=6288)|
| 1:44:55| up to, if you look during some of the months, sometimes over 1,200.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=6295)|
| 1:44:59| And, J.J., I'm going to ask him to come forward here in a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=6299)|
| 1:45:02| I'm not sure what the capacity is out there, but I think it's 1,200.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=6302)|
| 1:45:05| Is that your normal capacity out there, J.J.?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=6305)|
| 1:45:14| So I do know this in talking with J.J.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=6314)|
| 1:45:18| that he and the district attorney sit down on a regular basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=6318)|
| 1:45:24| In order to have room for the ones that need to come in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=6324)|
| 1:45:27| they sit down on a regular basis and say who's the least destructive we can let go early| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=6327)|
| 1:45:34| so we can have some room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=6334)|
| 1:45:35| And that's terrifying to me, particularly under conditions today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=6335)|
| 1:45:42| I do know that J.J. and I'm just going to get the highlights here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=6342)|
| 1:45:48| because I want him to come forward and tell you what the results of that meeting were.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=6348)|
| 1:45:52| He met recently with Madeline Rojero, our city mayor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=6352)|
| 1:45:56| and also Dr. Black from Helen Ross McNabb.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=6356)|
| 1:46:02| Concerning this issue, there is a large interest in this from the city's point right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=6362)|
| 1:46:11| which is the reason why I'm asking that we try to schedule a workshop with the city council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=6371)|
| 1:46:17| and commission regarding this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=6377)|
| 1:46:20| and try to get something done here before it's time for budgets for this coming year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=6380)|
| 1:46:24| So, J.J., if you would come forward and give us a little bit of a ----| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=6384)|
| 1:46:28| General Nichols back there also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=6388)|
| 1:46:32| Let them shed a little light on this subject because, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=6392)|
| 1:46:36| you can't ignore things for so long and just keep hoping they'll go away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=6396)|
| 1:46:44| We're looking down the road, not too distant future, in a $27 million pot out there for more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=6404)|
| 1:46:51| But we're going to have to have something to do in the meantime.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=6411)|
| 1:46:53| So, J.J., I'll let you and General Nichols take the floor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=6413)|
| 1:46:56| and kind of tell us where we are and where you all are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=6416)|
| 1:47:00| The sheriff has ordered me to talk first, so I will obey his order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=6420)|
| 1:47:07| We met Friday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=6427)|
| 1:47:08| It was a week ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=6428)|
| 1:47:11| We met with Mayor Rojero and Deputy Chief Price and the sheriff and Andy Black| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=6431)|
| 1:47:20| and I laid out pretty much where we were.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=6440)|
| 1:47:25| We talked in round figures, basically talked about the problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=6445)|
| 1:47:31| As you pointed out, we had 1,209 on the 8 o'clock count.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=6451)|
| 1:47:36| We're approaching we're getting full downstairs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=6456)|
| 1:47:40| We housed the female prisoners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=6460)|
| 1:47:43| That's always a key to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=6463)|
| 1:47:47| When we get full downstairs, we've got real problems, ladies and gentlemen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=6467)|
| 1:47:51| and we're getting very close to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=6471)|
| 1:47:56| I thought that the mayor's reaction was very positive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=6476)|
| 1:48:01| and indicated that she would like further discussions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=6481)|
| 1:48:04| And I think she even used the word, Commissioner Brown,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=6484)|
| 1:48:07| to maybe have a joint meeting of the council and this commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=6487)|
| 1:48:12| And so we would very much urge you to do that so we can get these discussions going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=6492)|
| 1:48:20| to see what we all feel is in the best interest of this community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=6500)|
| 1:48:29| Anything to add, J.J.?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=6509)|
| 1:48:31| I'm only to add that the number out at the detention facility is 1039 is the number,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=6511)|
| 1:48:36| and in the last four weeks we've been over that number twice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=6516)|
| 1:48:41| And along with Randy, I was very satisfied with the meeting we had with the city mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=6521)|
| 1:48:49| This is the first time that it seems like that everyone is on the same page with the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=6529)|
| 1:48:54| the county, and even the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=6534)|
| 1:48:56| General Nichols has had some discussions with Commissioner Varney,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=6536)|
| 1:48:59| Commissioner of Mental Health,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=6539)|
| 1:49:01| and they're also willing to participate and kick in into this idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=6541)|
| 1:49:07| So this is the first time that we've actually had everyone at the table being receptive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=6547)|
| 1:49:12| We've also had a chance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=6552)|
| 1:49:13| I had a chance just today to talk to Mayor Burchett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=6553)|
| 1:49:16| He's been sick, and that was the reason he wasn't included in the initial meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=6556)|
| 1:49:20| But he has been very receptive also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=6560)|
| 1:49:25| So, again, for the first time we're all seems like all the players are at the table| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=6565)|
| 1:49:31| in a very positive approach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=6571)|
| 1:49:33| That's the one factor that I had forgotten, the fact that we do have some state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=6573)|
| 1:49:38| and other governmental folks that are interested in possibly helping fund some of this project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=6578)|
| 1:49:45| and supporting it in some way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=6585)|
| 1:49:47| So the stars are aligned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=6587)|
| 1:49:50| So I'll stop with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=6590)|
| 1:49:52| Mr. Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=6592)|
| 1:49:54| Thank you, gentlemen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=6594)|
| 1:49:57| J.J., in your opinion, and, Randy, I want your opinion on this also,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=6597)|
| 1:50:01| the safety center was going to give us how many beds?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=6601)|
| 1:50:05| Was it like 30 or 40?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=6605)|
| 1:50:08| Twelve Berco loungers is what will be in the safety center itself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=6608)|
| 1:50:13| twelve for the triage center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=6613)|
| 1:50:16| And it was going to cost how much?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=6616)|
| 1:50:18| We kind of got hung up on that number,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=6618)|
| 1:50:20| and I wish Andy was here to explain to you how many individuals that they've already seen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=6620)|
| 1:50:25| at the safety center in a facility that has 16 beds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=6625)|
| 1:50:30| Over 4,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=6630)|
| 1:50:31| Over 4,000 to date this year that they have actually touched with those beds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=6631)|
| 1:50:38| So it seems like when we talk about that small number of beds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=6638)|
| 1:50:43| people kind of say, well, what's that going to do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=6643)|
| 1:50:45| How's that going to help?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=6645)|
| 1:50:47| But when you can see the number of people that they've touched| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=6647)|
| 1:50:50| with the amount of beds they have at the CSU, you can see that these numbers add up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=6650)|
| 1:50:57| This will touch many individuals in a year's time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=6657)|
| 1:51:00| Weren't they wanting to build something else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=6660)|
| 1:51:03| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=6663)|
| 1:51:04| Yes, it would be on the Helen Ross McNabb land adjacent to where their buildings are right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=6664)|
| 1:51:11| And if it was built today, it would house how many people?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=6671)|
| 1:51:15| Well, roughly, we started off, we were talking about 18, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=6675)|
| 1:51:19| with the ability to expand ten more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=6679)|
| 1:51:24| So, I mean, roughly it would be initially because of the staff demands,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=6684)|
| 1:51:28| we would have to start with that number 16 to 18,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=6688)|
| 1:51:31| and then hopefully in the future once we saw the demand for it would increase the number of beds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=6691)|
| 1:51:37| Randy, in your opinion, I'm looking at this as a building project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=6697)|
| 1:51:42| are we better off going over there or going out here and helping J.J. give him another pod?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=6702)|
| 1:51:47| I think that you, for the cost,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=6707)|
| 1:51:51| you're better off to go this route with a safety center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=6711)|
| 1:51:55| I'm not saying that you're not going to have to do another pod sooner or later, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=6715)|
| 1:52:00| I'm not saying that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=6720)|
| 1:52:01| I think that would be a foolish remark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=6721)|
| 1:52:03| But I believe that we can delay four, three, four, five years or so before you'd have to get into that amount of money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=6723)|
| 1:52:14| Now, that's what I think would happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=6734)|
| 1:52:17| But also, I think one of the keys to it now, which makes it some different for me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=6737)|
| 1:52:23| is the state willing to walk in now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=6743)|
| 1:52:25| I talked just as late as last Thursday with Commissioner Varney, and he knows what's going on in this community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=6745)|
| 1:52:33| He knows the talk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=6753)|
| 1:52:35| He is very encouraging.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=6755)|
| 1:52:36| And I said, you know, we can't afford to get down the road and look back, Commissioner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=6756)|
| 1:52:41| and not see you somewhere with a purse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=6761)|
| 1:52:44| And he said for us not to concern ourselves with that, that they were going to make a substantial commitment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=6764)|
| 1:52:50| The key to it, though, in my opinion, is that if this works as we think it will, what it is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=6770)|
| 1:52:57| it's the template for the rest of the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=6777)|
| 1:53:00| And they'll get into a position where they have got to play hard on this to make it work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=6780)|
| 1:53:07| so they can replicate it across this state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=6787)|
| 1:53:09| And the fact we're the first ones to the trough, as it were,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=6789)|
| 1:53:13| I think we can leverage this with the Department of Mental Health,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=6793)|
| 1:53:18| who have got significant issues to deal with all over this state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=6798)|
| 1:53:23| And if we can be the first one and make a workable center, as I think we can do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=6803)|
| 1:53:29| then I think our costs go down and the good goes up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=6809)|
| 1:53:34| And you might buy even a few more years before you're in a jail business, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=6814)|
| 1:53:38| Yes, that makes sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=6818)|
| 1:53:39| J.J., with what you want to do with Andy Black,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=6819)|
| 1:53:42| the new proposal would be for how many beds or recliners or what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=6822)|
| 1:53:47| Well, I think it starts at, I think we initially said 12.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=6827)|
| 1:53:51| And then the 16 CSU beds that are already available that Helen Ross-McNabb has right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=6831)|
| 1:53:57| they would move that facility also to the facility where the safety center would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=6837)|
| 1:54:03| So they would be right next door to each other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=6843)|
| 1:54:05| They've assured us that they would do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=6845)|
| 1:54:07| So the first process, the first place you would stop would be at the safety center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=6847)|
| 1:54:12| And then you would be evaluated for at least a period of three days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=6852)|
| 1:54:16| You would have the option of going there and not going to jail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=6856)|
| 1:54:20| Then after that evaluation, if you needed further evaluation, then from there you would be sent to the CSU,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=6860)|
| 1:54:26| the Crisis Stabilization Unit, for another period of three to five days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=6866)|
| 1:54:30| And hopefully by that period of time they have some kind of system worked out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=6870)|
| 1:54:34| where they have a supervisor for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=6874)|
| 1:54:36| They have you on some type of medication if you need to be on that medication.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=6876)|
| 1:54:40| And you're supervised to make sure you're doing the right thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=6880)|
| 1:54:43| That way you never darken the doors of the jail where you don't need to be to begin with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=6883)|
| 1:54:50| Yeah, that's the beauty part of the whole thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=6890)|
| 1:54:52| But taking off of what our Attorney General just said, JJ, do we need to go to 50 beds with Helen Ross-McNabb?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=6892)|
| 1:54:59| I'm just trying to get the bigger bang for the buck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=6899)|
| 1:55:03| If Randy says that we can possibly get some state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=6903)|
| 1:55:05| and federal money as a watchdog, let's expand what we're wanting there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=6905)|
| 1:55:10| And that's going to lay you even further out here building another pod.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=6910)|
| 1:55:13| What's your thought on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=6913)|
| 1:55:14| The key to the larger number of beds is staffing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=6914)|
| 1:55:18| That's the only difference that would make going from a number of 12 or 16 or 18 to 50.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=6918)|
| 1:55:25| You just have to pay additional staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=6925)|
| 1:55:28| If we had 50, JJ, would they fill them up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=6928)|
| 1:55:30| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=6930)|
| 1:55:32| You have that many?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=6932)|
| 1:55:33| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=6933)|
| 1:55:34| You know, I support you for getting what you need, JJ.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=6934)|
| 1:55:38| Get what you need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=6938)|
| 1:55:39| You know, the bottom line is, and Randy and I have said this from the very beginning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=6939)|
| 1:55:42| it's not fair to these individuals who are being held in jail with these mental illnesses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=6942)|
| 1:55:47| and not getting the treatment that they deserve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=6947)|
| 1:55:50| It's also not fair to the taxpayers who are footing the bill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=6950)|
| 1:55:54| And these people, we see it time and time again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=6954)|
| 1:55:57| They're frequent flyers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=6957)|
| 1:55:58| They're repeat offenders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=6958)|
| 1:56:00| We see them over and over and over again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=6960)|
| 1:56:03| And if we could divert them out of the correctional facility into a facility where they will get the help they need,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=6963)|
| 1:56:11| the cost of us doing business goes way down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=6971)|
| 1:56:16| To me, the bigger we make the safety center, the farther off we have to build another pod for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=6976)|
| 1:56:22| I mean, and I love the program, what you're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=6982)|
| 1:56:24| I think it's a great program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=6984)|
| 1:56:26| Mr. Chairman, can I?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=6986)|
| 1:56:27| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=6987)|
| 1:56:28| I'm jumping ahead, but let me just continue one thought JJ brought up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=6988)|
| 1:56:30| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=6990)|
| 1:56:32| If they're in the jail and we have to treat them, we're paying for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=6992)|
| 1:56:36| If they go through this safety center, their insurance or TennCare or whatever is going to be paying for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=6996)|
| 1:56:42| And he talked about our costs going down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=7002)|
| 1:56:45| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=7005)|
| 1:56:46| Maybe when we get into this workshop, you can give us some figures on what that costs us over, say, the last year for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=7006)|
| 1:56:52| But, I mean, that, to me, is a big, a big issue right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=7012)|
| 1:56:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=7017)|
| 1:56:58| Mr. McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=7018)|
| 1:56:59| I'm sure you covered a lot of it, JJ.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=7019)|
| 1:57:02| And that's, you know, it's, to me, two things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=7022)|
| 1:57:08| I applaud, regardless of the number, you and the Attorney General sitting down and saying, who can we release?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=7028)|
| 1:57:16| I mean, that's always, you know, you're not going to put anyone unsafe on the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=7036)|
| 1:57:22| You know, it's that marginal, you know, probably repeat offender that you guys are dealing with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=7042)|
| 1:57:27| So I encourage you to continue that, regardless of what we do with the safety center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=7047)|
| 1:57:32| You know, there are some folks that just probably choose to get three hot meals and a cot, you know, along the way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=7052)|
| 1:57:39| So I applaud you for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=7059)|
| 1:57:42| You know, and to me, this isn't a dollar value or whether the state kicks in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=7062)|
| 1:57:47| Those are good things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=7067)|
| 1:57:48| And please continue those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=7068)|
| 1:57:50| But to me, it's the level of care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=7070)|
| 1:57:53| It's what you said, it's treating the issue, not locking someone up, which is, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=7073)|
| 1:57:58| a very expensive way of doing business as opposed to getting whatever mental health issue they have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=7078)|
| 1:58:08| and getting them back to being productive citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=7088)|
| 1:58:11| And hopefully that will be something lasting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=7091)|
| 1:58:15| You know, and to do that, that process at a much more efficient and reduced cost for our constituents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=7095)|
| 1:58:24| So, you know, those are the main things, and I appreciate you touching on those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=7104)|
| 1:58:28| And I guess the last aside, I don't think Andy is a doctor, is he?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=7108)|
| 1:58:33| He's not a medical doctor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=7113)|
| 1:58:35| He might be a Ph.D. doctor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=7115)|
| 1:58:37| Psychiatrist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=7117)|
| 1:58:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=7118)|
| 1:58:39| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=7119)|
| 1:58:42| Is that it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=7122)|
| 1:58:43| Dr. Briggs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=7123)|
| 1:58:45| I wanted to make a couple of comments because I think we had a lot of lunches together over the years on this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=7125)|
| 1:58:51| as a member of the Justice Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=7131)|
| 1:58:53| And the slight thing that I would differ with you is that we're sort of all coming together now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=7133)|
| 1:58:58| I think we've all agreed for a long time that this needed to be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=7138)|
| 1:59:02| And where the hang-up came, there was a couple of hang-ups,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=7142)|
| 1:59:06| but the big hang-up came was how were we going to pay for it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=7146)|
| 1:59:09| And I'm going to throw a couple of other things out there about how this can save money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=7149)|
| 1:59:12| If you have people down here, you're saving on transportation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=7152)|
| 1:59:16| And part of the reason the city's --I'm talking about the number of officers you're bringing back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=7156)|
| 1:59:21| and forth for these people to go to court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=7161)|
| 1:59:24| And then also the city has an interest because they're taking their police officers off duty to run those people out to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=7164)|
| 1:59:30| you know, out to Maloneyville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=7170)|
| 1:59:32| And that's the savings there, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=7172)|
| 1:59:33| And I think we've all agreed with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=7173)|
| 1:59:36| We've gone all through this enthusiasm that we've had before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=7176)|
| 1:59:39| but what throws the wet blanket on it when it comes time to paying for it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=7179)|
| 1:59:43| And that's where the hang-up was before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=7183)|
| 1:59:46| And I know I think the questions we kept asking the sheriff, which he was very honest in that he was not able to answer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=7186)|
| 1:59:52| is how much money are we going to save by this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=7192)|
| 1:59:54| And that's a hard question that we don't know until we look back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=7194)|
| 1:59:57| We can't say we're going to save this or we can't say we're going to take this out of your budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=7197)|
| 2:00:01| because you're not going to need that money and put it over here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=7201)|
| 2:00:04| And that's something that's very difficult that we can, you know, that we're looking at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=7204)|
| 2:00:09| I'm a little bit more cautious than Commissioner Smith is about the number of beds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=7209)|
| 2:00:15| because I believe most of these were 72-hour beds or less.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=7215)|
| 2:00:19| And that's why they can run so many people, 4,000 people through there with 16 beds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=7219)|
| 2:00:24| is because it's a very short duration as opposed to what we keep them out in the jail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=7224)|
| 2:00:28| And if you start adding your numbers up, I mean, you'd have tens of thousands of prisoners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=7228)|
| 2:00:34| Not all these prisoners are really going to the safety center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=7234)|
| 2:00:40| And I think I would start on the low side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=7240)|
| 2:00:43| And we can have all the enthusiasm about how great it would be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=7243)|
| 2:00:46| but I can tell you it's going to get into the millions of dollars on operational cost| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=7246)|
| 2:00:50| because when we looked at this originally, I think it was going to cost $1.8 million to build the place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=7250)|
| 2:00:55| And it was going to be over $1 million a year to run 12 beds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=7255)|
| 2:00:59| We run 50 beds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=7259)|
| 2:01:00| Is that going to be $5 million, $6 million, $7 million because your personnel costs go up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=7260)|
| 2:01:04| Does anybody know on an operational budget personnel costs or what's so great?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=7264)|
| 2:01:09| And I think we should go a little cautious with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=7269)|
| 2:01:13| The only different type of money to do it, that's the game changer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=7273)|
| 2:01:16| I think everybody was on board before, but we just didn't have a mechanism to pay for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=7276)|
| 2:01:20| Remember, we looked at CAC and shifting funds out of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=7280)|
| 2:01:23| We told we couldn't do it without it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=7283)|
| 2:01:25| We had Alvin Nance one time at a lunch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=7285)|
| 2:01:27| He thought he could get federal money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=7287)|
| 2:01:29| And I remember we even had down here one of the commission meetings where the --.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=7289)|
| 2:01:33| There was somebody down here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=7293)|
| 2:01:34| I don't remember who he was, but he told us that that couldn't be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=7294)|
| 2:01:36| I think he was a consultant that did grant writing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=7296)|
| 2:01:39| And he told us we couldn't get the federal money for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=7299)|
| 2:01:42| But if we could get the -- if we can get state money, that's the game changer here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=7302)|
| 2:01:47| The obstacle that we're going to -- there's two obstacles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=7307)|
| 2:01:50| A couple of obstacles we're going to see with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=7310)|
| 2:01:52| One is going to be neighborhood opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=7312)|
| 2:01:55| And, you know, even Amy Broyles, who is always very sympathetic to the inubriated people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=7315)|
| 2:02:03| I started calling them drunks, but that's probably not true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=7323)|
| 2:02:06| But to the people who are, you know, who are inubriated and have to go down there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=7326)|
| 2:02:11| she said we have enough in our neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=7331)|
| 2:02:13| And there's going to be a lot of neighborhood opposition to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=7333)|
| 2:02:17| I don't know if we could overcome that if there's any possibility of doing anything out at Lakeshore with this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=7337)|
| 2:02:24| with the state because, you know, that's a possibility to look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=7344)|
| 2:02:28| But we will run into neighborhood opposition if we put another facility such as this downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=7348)|
| 2:02:37| I'm going to be for it regardless because I do think it's a good idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=7357)|
| 2:02:40| And it's not a matter of turning away dangerous prisoners or this or that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=7360)|
| 2:02:44| it really is just getting the right people or getting the people who have a problem in the right place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=7364)|
| 2:02:49| to be treated in the most cost-effective way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=7369)|
| 2:02:52| And also you're taking care of them better than throwing them in jail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=7372)|
| 2:02:54| So we've got a lot of good reasons to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=7374)|
| 2:02:56| The game changer is if we can get the state to pay for it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=7376)|
| 2:02:59| and then we find a place to put it that will be acceptable to the citizenry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=7379)|
| 2:03:07| Mr. Hammer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=7387)|
| 2:03:08| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=7388)|
| 2:03:09| I'll echo what Commissioner Briggs said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=7389)|
| 2:03:11| I'm in favor of it as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=7391)|
| 2:03:12| We've been talking about this concept ever since I've been on commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=7392)|
| 2:03:15| That's been about eight years now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=7395)|
| 2:03:17| When we keep talking about the cost, the fact is we're paying for it anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=7397)|
| 2:03:20| I mean, when you look at what's going on at the detention facility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=7400)|
| 2:03:23| and all the man hours it's taking to do this, I mean, we're paying for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=7403)|
| 2:03:26| It's just a matter of do we want to provide a mechanism where we might be able to save money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=7406)|
| 2:03:31| and relieve some of the congestion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=7411)|
| 2:03:33| Just two years ago, General, I believe we were in the 900 range on the daily count.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=7413)|
| 2:03:37| Now we're all the way up to 1,200.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=7417)|
| 2:03:40| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=7420)|
| 2:03:41| And see, so that's just a couple of years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=7421)|
| 2:03:42| And so you see what's going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=7422)|
| 2:03:44| I'm in favor of the concept.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=7424)|
| 2:03:45| And I don't know if it's proper to make a motion or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=7425)|
| 2:03:47| but I'd like to ask the chairman of the commission to set a meeting in the next 90 days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=7427)|
| 2:03:52| a joint meeting with the city council so we can get this going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=7432)|
| 2:03:55| Because I think that we really need to do something with the legislature going into session| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=7435)|
| 2:03:59| with Mr. Varney doing it, I think, sooner than later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=7439)|
| 2:04:03| And so I'd like to go ahead, if it's proper to make a motion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=7443)|
| 2:04:05| that we have a meeting with the city council in the next 90 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=7445)|
| 2:04:09| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=7449)|
| 2:04:10| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=7450)|
| 2:04:11| Can I make a friendly amendment to his motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=7451)|
| 2:04:17| I couldn't hear what he said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=7457)|
| 2:04:18| Can I make a friendly amendment to his motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=7458)|
| 2:04:23| Let me talk to him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=7463)|
| 2:04:24| Let me look at the law director just a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=7464)|
| 2:04:26| I talked to him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=7466)|
| 2:04:27| He may want to change it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=7467)|
| 2:04:28| It's just a request of the chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=7468)|
| 2:04:29| We have a discussion item in commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=7469)|
| 2:04:31| Go ahead, because I'm just requesting that we do it in 90 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=7471)|
| 2:04:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=7474)|
| 2:04:34| It's just a request of the chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=7474)|
| 2:04:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=7482)|
| 2:04:43| Yeah, we don't have to do this in the form of a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=7483)|
| 2:04:46| So I'll do that and bring that back before commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=7486)|
| 2:04:50| It's going to be a good time to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=7490)|
| 2:04:51| You can coordinate with Mr. Nichols and others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=7491)|
| 2:04:53| But, you know, the motion was to have some kind of a joint meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=7493)|
| 2:04:55| and I think sooner than later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=7495)|
| 2:04:57| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=7497)|
| 2:04:58| I was of the essence because budget cycle is coming up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=7498)|
| 2:05:01| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=7501)|
| 2:05:02| I think it's a good place to have the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=7502)|
| 2:05:04| It's going to be too late.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=7504)|
| 2:05:05| You know, our first meeting is going to be too late to get anything in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=7505)|
| 2:05:08| We'll try to set something up in February.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=7508)|
| 2:05:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=7511)|
| 2:05:13| Early February.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=7513)|
| 2:05:18| I do believe you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=7518)|
| 2:05:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=7519)|
| 2:05:20| Other things?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=7520)|
| 2:05:21| Hold on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=7521)|
| 2:05:22| You're not done, General.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=7522)|
| 2:05:23| Hold on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=7523)|
| 2:05:24| Mr. Owenby.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=7524)|
| 2:05:26| Yeah, thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=7526)|
| 2:05:30| I did support the safety center last time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=7530)|
| 2:05:33| and only because I felt like the state should be helping us fund it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=7533)|
| 2:05:38| And that was my biggest proponent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=7538)|
| 2:05:40| Now that we don't have Lakeshore, these mental patients need a place to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=7540)|
| 2:05:45| They don't need to be in jail because a lot of them commit public intoxication,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=7545)|
| 2:05:50| things like that, just because they're not on their meds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=7550)|
| 2:05:54| I agree with Dr. Briggs that I think the site is already there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=7554)|
| 2:05:59| Lakeshore is a perfect opportunity, perfect place to have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=7559)|
| 2:06:02| The state already owns the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=7562)|
| 2:06:04| Helen Ross McNabb is already down there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=7564)|
| 2:06:08| That would be a perfect and ideal place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=7568)|
| 2:06:10| It's already there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=7570)|
| 2:06:13| And a lot of these patients have been there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=7573)|
| 2:06:15| So it would be a familiar site for them to go to to be able to get the treatment they need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=7575)|
| 2:06:22| The reason they're only held for three days is because that's state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=7582)|
| 2:06:25| You can't hold them longer than three days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=7585)|
| 2:06:31| I'm kind of pushed into supporting this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=7591)|
| 2:06:34| I mean, not that I've ever been against it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=7594)|
| 2:06:36| I mean, I'm supporting it as long as the state will come through with funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=7596)|
| 2:06:40| Because I feel that ultimately it is the state's responsibility to take care of these mental patients| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=7600)|
| 2:06:45| because they come from all over this region, not just Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=7605)|
| 2:06:48| And it's not fair for the Knox County citizens to burden that cost all on their own.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=7608)|
| 2:06:53| So if the state is willing to come with that, then I'll back it and I'll be for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=7613)|
| 2:07:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=7621)|
| 2:07:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=7622)|
| 2:07:03| Thank you, General Nichols and Sheriff Jones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=7623)|
| 2:07:05| And I would say maybe if you would ask, get with Chris and find out when about the meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=7625)|
| 2:07:12| where he would want it before the budget process starts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=7632)|
| 2:07:16| Because sometimes that's what we got before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=7636)|
| 2:07:18| We waited too late and the budget was already set and the process was already gone through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=7638)|
| 2:07:22| So we've had some discussions with him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=7642)|
| 2:07:24| But sooner better than later would certainly be better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=7644)|
| 2:07:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=7647)|
| 2:07:28| I'll get with Chris and also Nick Pavlis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=7648)|
| 2:07:31| and we'll run it over there to the city folks and see what they think about a meeting as soon as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=7651)|
| 2:07:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=7657)|
| 2:07:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=7658)|
| 2:07:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=7659)|
| 2:07:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=7661)|
| 2:07:44| Mr. Ryder, you're up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=7664)|
| 2:07:45| I'm going to speak about Boy Scouts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=7665)|
| 2:07:47| Oh, Boy Scouts, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=7667)|
| 2:07:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=7668)|
| 2:07:49| To that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=7669)|
| 2:07:50| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=7670)|
| 2:07:51| We have honoraries at the beginning of the commission meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=7671)|
| 2:07:56| I've got some Boy Scouts in the troop that I was a charter member that have made Eagle Scout this year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=7676)|
| 2:08:03| that I'd like to honor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=7683)|
| 2:08:05| And then there's also a group of Scouts that need to come and get their civics thing by attending a public meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=7685)|
| 2:08:12| But it conflicts with them being in school during the day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=7692)|
| 2:08:17| The January meeting before zoning, we don't have any zonings this month, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=7697)|
| 2:08:24| Don't see any.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=7704)|
| 2:08:26| There's not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=7706)|
| 2:08:27| No zonings this month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=7707)|
| 2:08:28| So it should be a quick meeting because we get to go home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=7708)|
| 2:08:34| The January meeting, regular official January meeting of commission at 15 minutes before zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=7714)|
| 2:08:45| I recognize Boy Scouts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=7725)|
| 2:08:48| I don't see why that would be a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=7728)|
| 2:08:50| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=7730)|
| 2:08:51| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=7731)|
| 2:08:52| That way I can let them know when they can get scheduled and all that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=7732)|
| 2:08:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=7735)|
| 2:08:56| And, Joey, you take note of that and remind us of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=7736)|
| 2:08:58| That would be good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=7738)|
| 2:08:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=7739)|
| 2:09:02| Go ahead, Mr. Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=7742)|
| 2:09:04| Michael Ryder, can you come here real quick speaking about Boy Scouts?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=7744)|
| 2:09:10| I had came up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=7750)|
| 2:09:11| Brad had mentioned this, and I thought it was a good idea, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=7751)|
| 2:09:14| The Boy Scouts are coming, and there should be enough time to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=7754)|
| 2:09:17| If you'll get with a Bruce Van Cleave, Bruce Van Cleave with the Boy Scouts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=7757)|
| 2:09:22| we'd like to make a patch, a commemorative patch, as the guys come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=7762)|
| 2:09:27| And just like I say, when they get their Eagle, Scouts love patches.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=7767)|
| 2:09:31| Give them something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=7771)|
| 2:09:32| We don't have to put a date on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=7772)|
| 2:09:33| But some way incorporate our logo and something with the Boy Scouts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=7773)|
| 2:09:37| and maybe we could pass those out to the Boy Scouts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=7777)|
| 2:09:42| We could do the same thing to the Girl Scouts, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=7782)|
| 2:09:44| if they attend our meetings and the chairman or whoever or whatever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=7784)|
| 2:09:48| they could be presented those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=7788)|
| 2:09:50| They love to collect those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=7790)|
| 2:09:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=7792)|
| 2:09:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=7793)|
| 2:09:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=7794)|
| 2:09:55| Mr. Shouse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=7795)|
| 2:09:56| Mr. Chairman, I just wanted to put it on the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=7796)|
| 2:09:58| At 9 o'clock tomorrow morning, the Audit Committee meets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=7798)|
| 2:10:01| I think Mr. Walz is on the agenda, right, with Mr. Walz| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=7801)|
| 2:10:05| and some other entities that are interested in possibly pursuing the internal audit function.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=7805)|
| 2:10:12| So public meeting, I hope members of the commission will be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=7812)|
| 2:10:15| And, of course, I hope Mr. Wright and myself| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=7815)|
| 2:10:18| and Commissioner Brawls plan to be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=7818)|
| 2:10:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=7821)|
| 2:10:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=7822)|
| 2:10:23| Any further business?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=7823)|
| 2:10:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=7825)|
| 2:10:26| Seeing none, we're adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=7826)|
| 2:10:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121210?start=7827)|
