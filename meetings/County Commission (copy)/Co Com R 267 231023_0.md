| 0:01:38| Oh my goodness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=98)|
| 0:01:40| We didn't recognize you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=100)|
| 0:01:42| It's the hat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=102)|
| 0:01:46| I'm State Representative Lowell Russell from the 21st District. I'm here with Marshal Andy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=106)|
| 0:01:50| Thank you. Thank you so much for coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=110)|
| 0:01:53| All right. Do we have any others?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=113)|
| 0:01:56| And I apologize, sir. My eyes don't look that far.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=116)|
| 0:02:01| Also up here to my left, we have Kim Ellis, who's with the clerk's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=121)|
| 0:02:07| And to my right, I have Gene Oster.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=127)|
| 0:02:11| At this point, I'd like to turn this over to Commissioner Durrett for our devotional.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=131)|
| 0:02:22| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=142)|
| 0:02:24| In the spirit of celebrating the season we have now entered into, I would like to reflect on the beauty of nature's transformation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=144)|
| 0:02:32| As the leaves turn vibrant shades of red, orange, and yellow, let us find inspiration in this changing season.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=152)|
| 0:02:39| This month reminds us of the importance of life as nature sheds its old and embraces the new.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=159)|
| 0:02:46| Let this be a reminder to us to let go of what no longer serves us and welcome growth and change with open arms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=166)|
| 0:02:56| In October, the days grow shorter and the nights grow longer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=176)|
| 0:02:59| This is a time to appreciate the quiet moments, to find solace in the gentle embrace of darkness, and to seek inner peace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=179)|
| 0:03:07| As we savor the flavors of autumn from pumpkin spice to crisp apples, let us also savor the moments with loved ones as this is a time for cozy gatherings and warm conversations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=187)|
| 0:03:19| Let us not forget to give thanks for the abundance in our lives and to share our blessings with those less fortunate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=199)|
| 0:03:28| The harvest this season teaches us value of generosity and community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=208)|
| 0:03:34| Let us honor this season as a time of reflection, transformation, gratitude, and togetherness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=214)|
| 0:03:41| May it inspire us to live our lives with mindfulness, embracing change, and cherishing the beauty in every season.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=221)|
| 0:03:51| And I would also like to have a moment of silence for the passing of Larry Cox, who was a fantastic person and truly an ambassador to North Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=231)|
| 0:04:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=257)|
| 0:04:20| Thank you for that, Commissioner Durrett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=260)|
| 0:04:23| And also, if we could just please keep in our hearts and prayers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=263)|
| 0:04:27| We've put two of our boys, so to speak, our police officer and then also an active duty member in Commissioner Beeler's community that came home that was also buried this past week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=267)|
| 0:04:45| Just a reminder, too, of our problems that we have overseas, not only in our issues with Ukraine, but also our horrible, horrible atrocities that are occurring in Israel at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=285)|
| 0:05:06| So let's just all be very mindful of how blessed we are to be here in our own United States of America.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=306)|
| 0:05:12| So thank you for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=312)|
| 0:05:14| Commissioner Beeler, if you'd lead the pledge, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=314)|
| 0:05:17| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=317)|
| 0:05:18| Please stand, face our nation's flag, and join me in the Pledge of Allegiance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=318)|
| 0:05:26| I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America, and to the republic for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=326)|
| 0:05:43| Thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=343)|
| 0:05:46| A moment of privilege, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=346)|
| 0:05:49| I'm going to turn the floor over to Commissioner Schoonmaker as he'd like to make an announcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=349)|
| 0:05:57| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=357)|
| 0:05:59| Last week, the Tennessee County Commissioners Association held their annual meeting in Chattanooga.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=359)|
| 0:06:06| And at the award ceremony, out of 1,620 commissioners across the state of Tennessee, they recognized three commissioners from each of the grand divisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=366)|
| 0:06:21| And the gentleman that was selected from East Tennessee, kind of beating out 510 other colleagues that are county commissioners in East Tennessee, was none other than our own Carson Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=381)|
| 0:06:39| Would you please stand and show your appreciation for this outstanding Tennessee County Commissioner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=399)|
| 0:06:51| I hope that will end up on the front page somewhere of our local media.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=411)|
| 0:07:00| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=420)|
| 0:07:02| You are welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=422)|
| 0:07:03| And up here, just so everyone knows, we affectionately call him our Litter Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=423)|
| 0:07:09| So your reputation is well deserved, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=429)|
| 0:07:13| You're welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=433)|
| 0:07:18| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=438)|
| 0:07:20| Moving on at this point, if it be the pleasure of the body, we're going to set the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=440)|
| 0:07:26| And the changes that we have at this point, if you'll look at items 48, 49, and 50, are all deferred.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=446)|
| 0:07:39| We have no withdrawals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=459)|
| 0:07:42| Non-consent is item one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=462)|
| 0:07:46| We're also pulling item 25 that was on consent last week and moving it to non-consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=466)|
| 0:07:52| There's just a brief explanation that will accompany that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=472)|
| 0:07:56| Item 43, 44, 46, 47, 51, and 52.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=476)|
| 0:08:05| To repeat, non-consent, 1, 25, 43, 44, 46, 47, 51, and 52.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=485)|
| 0:08:20| If that pleases the body, I'd also like to have a motion including the agenda| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=500)|
| 0:08:27| and also consent for our education and government consent calendars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=507)|
| 0:08:37| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=517)|
| 0:08:44| Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=524)|
| 0:08:46| Thank you, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=526)|

| 0:09:03| I am confused with item one being on non-consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=543)|
| 0:09:09| That was my error and the clerk just called my attention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=549)|
| 0:09:15| So is it 41?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=555)|
| 0:09:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=557)|

| 0:09:52| No, let's go on and do the honorary resolutions, all right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=592)|
| 0:09:55| If you'd read the first honorary resolution, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=595)|
| 0:10:04| We just did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=604)|

| 0:11:14| And so we use this opportunity and this time and commission to honor those who have had established careers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=674)|

| 0:14:13| Well, thank you. Thank you very, very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=853)|
| 0:14:41| I noticed that one of the worst things in the world can happen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=881)|
| 0:14:45| other than a terrible accident or death or something, to a person is start to lose his voice right before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=885)|
| 0:14:51| And something's going on right now. They tell me everywhere I go,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=891)|
| 0:14:55| someone's having throat problems and can hardly talk. And it's affected my voice and my throat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=895)|
| 0:15:01| But anyway, I'm so honored and feel so special tonight, much, much more than I deserve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=901)|
| 0:15:08| I've been honored from Nashville as well with the proclamations, two of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=908)|
| 0:15:16| But I hold this one right up there top with everybody because I love Knoxville and East Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=916)|
| 0:15:24| I want you to know that Ted Turner sent me here in 1968 from New York City.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=924)|
| 0:15:31| And from there, he sold the company. It was Turner Advertising, outdoor advertising at the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=931)|
| 0:15:40| And then it became sold to another group of people that bought it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=940)|
| 0:15:46| They kept it a while. And I decided that I would stay with him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=946)|
| 0:15:50| And then Ted said, no, I want you back in Atlanta. So I moved back and I had to leave East Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=950)|
| 0:15:56| And ever since, oh, I guess the next year, year and a half, I was trying my best to get back to East Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=956)|
| 0:16:03| Knoxville, preferably. Well, this is what happened. Charles Tombers, who owned the Lost Sea,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=963)|
| 0:16:09| if you all heard of that, owned that place. He said, we just bought two, three acres of land over here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=969)|
| 0:16:15| And it's got a cave on it. And I understand you want to come back to Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=975)|
| 0:16:20| Would you come back as our marketing director?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=980)|
| 0:16:23| So two years later, I told Ted goodbye and came back to Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=983)|
| 0:16:29| And it's the best thing I ever did because people took to me like bees to honey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=989)|
| 0:16:35| I don't know what it was or what I've done, but whatever it was, I hope it lasts as long as I am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=995)|
| 0:16:41| I hate to correct anyone who has previously introduced me. Totally, I've just retired from 40 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=1001)|
| 0:16:48| I was with two other stations before I went to East Tennessee PBS.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=1008)|
| 0:16:54| I have been there over 33 years. And the other things I just turned 94 instead of 91.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=1014)|
| 0:17:05| Now, I have always been a positive person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=1025)|
| 0:17:10| I remember the time the man told me, he says, I've got this great young salesman,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=1030)|
| 0:17:15| but he can't speak on his feet. He's so good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=1035)|
| 0:17:18| But we take him to a Rotary Club and he can't even introduce his wife.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=1038)|
| 0:17:23| So what can we do with him?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=1043)|
| 0:17:25| So we'll send him to the next day on Carnegie Coast.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=1045)|
| 0:17:28| It comes when he went there and he was a greatest speakers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=1048)|
| 0:17:31| It turned out he was the man for the final night of all of the awards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=1051)|
| 0:17:37| They called it an on the way home. And this man is really, really positive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=1057)|
| 0:17:43| In my life, I have never, ever hung out with negative people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=1063)|
| 0:17:48| I love positive thinking, positive doing so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=1068)|
| 0:17:51| I could, you know, I could just see how this could happen to someone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=1071)|
| 0:17:55| But negativity will win.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=1075)|
| 0:17:58| You put 10 people in a motel room and one of them is negative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=1078)|
| 0:18:03| All 10 of them turn out the next morning the same way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=1083)|
| 0:18:07| It's just that way. I don't know what it is, but negatism is that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=1087)|
| 0:18:11| Anyway, on the way home that night, his wife was with him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=1091)|
| 0:18:14| She was so proud of him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=1094)|
| 0:18:17| The police were up there and they were gathered around the bridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=1097)|
| 0:18:22| And the cars were stopping and they looked up and the man was getting ready to jump.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=1102)|
| 0:18:27| And he said, Oh God, I could save that man. I know how to save him right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=1107)|
| 0:18:32| She said, Leave them alone. Let the police handle this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=1112)|
| 0:18:36| And he says, No, I can do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=1116)|
| 0:18:38| He pulls his coat off. He hands it to her. He scales up the side of the bridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=1118)|
| 0:18:42| It's one of those big iron measured bridge like we used to have right there at UT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=1122)|
| 0:18:48| And the guy sitting out there on the edge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=1128)|
| 0:18:51| And he says, Don't come any further. If you come, I'm going to jump.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=1131)|
| 0:18:54| He says, No, but I can help you. I can help you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=1134)|
| 0:18:58| He says, Stay where you are if you move.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=1138)|
| 0:19:00| He says, No, please just let me come and sit down by you and talk to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=1140)|
| 0:19:05| He said, OK, but I'm going to jump. You come on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=1145)|
| 0:19:07| He went out there and he sat down by that man and they started talking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=1147)|
| 0:19:12| And they talked. Ten minutes later, they both jumped.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=1152)|
| 0:19:22| Well, that's it. I'm going to leave you with the man in the glass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=1162)|
| 0:19:26| I've always never admired myself, but I have to watch from regardless every morning when I get up to shave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=1166)|
| 0:19:34| I did shave. Yeah, yeah, I did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=1174)|
| 0:19:38| Well, getting back for just a second. I haven't completely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=1178)|
| 0:19:42| I think Vicki, who runs the place and will stand behind me here, will tell you that I haven't completely left East Tennessee PBS.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=1182)|
| 0:19:50| I'll go back on special occasions and I certainly will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=1190)|
| 0:19:54| What I say we're doing right now, we have joined the Andy Griffith mode.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=1194)|
| 0:20:01| Reruns. That's where we are right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=1201)|
| 0:20:04| We just had our fourth one since I would know our fourth one this week will be on Saturday will be that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=1204)|
| 0:20:10| But anyway, I'll share this with you when you get what you want in the struggle for self.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=1210)|
| 0:20:18| And this would make you king or queen for a day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=1218)|
| 0:20:22| Then go to the mirror and look at yourself. See what that guy has to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=1222)|
| 0:20:27| But he's the one you must trust. Never mind all the rest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=1227)|
| 0:20:31| He's with you clear up to the end and you pass your most dangerous and difficult test.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=1231)|
| 0:20:37| If the man in the glass is your friend, it isn't your husband or your wife upon whose judgment you must pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=1237)|
| 0:20:45| The guy's verdict that counts most in this life is the one looking back in the glass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=1245)|
| 0:20:50| You can be like Jack Horner and chisel a plum and think, what a wonderful guy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=1250)|
| 0:20:55| But the guy in the glasses, you're only a bum if you can't look him straight in the eye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=1255)|
| 0:21:02| You can fool the whole world down through the years and you'll get some pats on your back as you pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=1262)|
| 0:21:08| But your final reward will be heartaches and tears if you've cheated that man in the glass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=1268)|
| 0:21:23| Commissioners, if you'll please join me on stage. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=1283)|
| 0:21:54| Yes, actually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=1314)|

| 0:26:23| So again, but the library would not be what it is without you all and our mayor who support reading and our libraries in the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=1583)|
| 0:26:33| And without that funding, it just wouldn't be what it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=1593)|
| 0:26:37| So I'm here tonight just to thank you for your support and to ask you for your continued support, which is desperately needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=1597)|
| 0:26:46| Material goes up, it seems like, just like everything else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=1606)|
| 0:26:51| The Friends Are Here is a support role.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=1611)|
| 0:26:54| And I just want to let you know that as of this year, for 2023-24, we've made a commitment to the library for an extra $50,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=1614)|
| 0:27:06| Toward programming and storybook trails and just to supplement everything else that this community needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=1626)|
| 0:27:13| So again, thank you for letting me come tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=1633)|
| 0:27:17| Enjoy the special treats that I've brought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=1637)|
| 0:27:20| And we will see you again next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=1640)|
| 0:27:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=1642)|
| 0:27:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=1643)|
| 0:27:24| Thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=1644)|
| 0:27:25| And thank you to Friends of the Library.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=1645)|
| 0:27:27| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=1647)|
| 0:27:33| We've completed our presentations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=1653)|
| 0:27:35| We are now going to pick up on Item 25.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=1655)|
| 0:27:41| Madam Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=1661)|
| 0:27:51| Item 25 is Resolution 503.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=1671)|
| 0:27:54| It's approving three agreements with Legal Aid of East Tennessee, $1,500,000, Community Mediation Center, $200,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=1674)|
| 0:28:03| Knoxville-Knox County Community Action Committee, $1,500,000 in Treasury Emergency Rental Assistance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=1683)|
| 0:28:11| ERA2 funds for eviction prevention and housing stability services, federally funded through Treasurer ERA2 program funds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=1691)|
| 0:28:21| state pass-through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=1701)|
| 0:28:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=1703)|
| 0:28:24| And before I take a motion on this, this was brought to my attention by Ms. Holden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=1704)|
| 0:28:28| She's our Director of Grants and Community Development, that there was a few minor changes in the contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=1708)|
| 0:28:34| So we appreciate you bringing this to us very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=1714)|
| 0:28:37| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=1717)|
| 0:28:38| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=1718)|
| 0:28:39| And I apologize for the late changes on these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=1719)|
| 0:28:41| We found out Friday these are state-funded contracts, and THDA wanted us to make just a couple of tweaks on our sub-recipient.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=1721)|
| 0:28:48| We have kind of a standard agreement that we use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=1728)|
| 0:28:51| And there are no material changes to this contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=1731)|
| 0:28:54| The biggest change is they wanted us to include the 1937 Housing Act definition of low-income families.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=1734)|
| 0:29:02| So you will see that under Section A, Part 1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=1742)|
| 0:29:06| And then they wanted us to add a link to the Treasury's program on the appendix and spell out a little bit more of that language.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=1746)|
| 0:29:16| We normally just cite the program and say you must follow all rules of the program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=1756)|
| 0:29:21| But THDA just wanted us to put a few specifics in under that appendix B.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=1761)|
| 0:29:26| All right, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=1766)|
| 0:29:28| Do we have a motion to approve this item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=1768)|
| 0:29:31| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=1771)|
| 0:29:32| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=1772)|
| 0:29:33| Motion by Frazier, second by Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=1773)|
| 0:29:36| Do we have any questions or discussion with Ms. Holden?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=1776)|
| 0:29:42| Seeing none, all those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=1782)|
| 0:29:45| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=1785)|
| 0:29:46| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=1786)|
| 0:29:47| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=1787)|
| 0:29:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=1788)|
| 0:29:49| Next item, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=1789)|
| 0:30:01| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=1801)|
| 0:30:03| Public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=1803)|
| 0:30:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=1805)|
| 0:30:06| We have three people signed up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=1806)|
| 0:30:11| The first is Constance Evry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=1811)|
| 0:30:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=1819)|
| 0:30:20| And for clarification, all of you that are speaking now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=1820)|
| 0:30:24| Can you put the agenda item on the screen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=1824)|
| 0:30:32| The item is 42310-211, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=1832)|
| 0:30:38| It should be 10, 11, I think it was 16 and 17.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=1838)|
| 0:30:42| I have 211, 301, and 302.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=1842)|
| 0:30:46| You're talking about item numbers, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=1846)|
| 0:30:49| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=1849)|
| 0:30:50| Those are the line items I signed up for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=1850)|
| 0:30:52| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=1852)|
| 0:30:53| Which one are we speaking to first, number 10 or 11?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=1853)|
| 0:30:56| All right, hold on a minute here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=1856)|
| 0:30:58| Item 10, hold on one minute, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=1858)|
| 0:31:08| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=1868)|
| 0:31:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=1879)|
| 0:31:20| Addressing item 10, if you'd identify yourself and your county, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=1880)|
| 0:31:26| And I will give you two minutes to speak on each item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=1886)|
| 0:31:30| Why two, not three?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=1890)|
| 0:31:35| That is a total of eight minutes that you actually will be having the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=1895)|
| 0:31:40| I will give you two minutes to speak on this first item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=1900)|
| 0:31:43| Interesting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=1903)|
| 0:31:44| Run it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=1904)|
| 0:31:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=1905)|
| 0:31:46| So Constance, Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=1906)|
| 0:31:47| I'm speaking to the first agenda item, number 11, because we are taking in roughly over $1 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=1907)|
| 0:31:53| When you read the resolution, this money is going primarily towards school security.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=1913)|
| 0:31:58| The concern is that school security has been funded for years across America.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=1918)|
| 0:32:03| And we have not seen success in this particular space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=1923)|
| 0:32:05| I want to challenge you all to start considering wraparound care services instead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=1925)|
| 0:32:10| You know, I cannot continue to not express the frustration that we hold over Anthony Thompson Jr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=1930)|
| 0:32:15| And after we watched last school year and this school year, white students particularly brought guns into the schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=1935)|
| 0:32:21| But the kicker is that they were not killed nor murdered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=1941)|
| 0:32:25| However, if we were being serious about addressing the issues that are causing children to bring guns into schools in the first place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=1945)|
| 0:32:30| which is the things such as housing and housing affordability,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=1950)|
| 0:32:34| if we were addressing the food disparities that we are dealing with, the medical deserts that these communities hold,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=1954)|
| 0:32:39| and more importantly, wraparound care services pertaining towards mental health services to assist these children with the dynamics of their home life as well as their community life,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=1959)|
| 0:32:48| then maybe instead of dumping money into police officers that have shown ineffective capabilities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=1968)|
| 0:32:53| we actually can start addressing the real concerns and issues around the issues we're having that quote unquote address or even concern security in the first place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=1973)|
| 0:33:01| I cannot understand how we are continuing to give money to police and we are having a housing crisis, an affordability crisis, and a homeless crisis right here in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=1981)|
| 0:33:10| And you all continue to think the best thing to do with our tax dollars, taxpayers' money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=1990)|
| 0:33:15| me and other individuals in the community who have expressed multiple times and multiple occasions what we want our money to go towards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=1995)|
| 0:33:21| You continue to dump it into police departments that are unaccounted for, rude in their behavior,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=2001)|
| 0:33:27| and more importantly are more threats than they have ever been security to particular demographics of community people and individuals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=2007)|
| 0:33:34| I yield my time on that initiative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=2014)|
| 0:33:36| Thank you. Thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=2016)|
| 0:33:39| The next item we're looking at is item 11.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=2019)|
| 0:33:48| All right. I had you signed up down here for 10, 11, 16, and 17. Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=2028)|
| 0:33:53| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=2033)|
| 0:33:54| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=2034)|
| 0:33:59| All right. Now you may speak to item 10.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=2039)|
| 0:34:04| So, same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=2044)|
| 0:34:06| So, if you take the two initiatives, we got 1.1, 2.4, we're roughly around $4 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=2046)|
| 0:34:11| There is a way that we could be very effective with the funding to address the real issues and concerns of the community, and it's not more police.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=2051)|
| 0:34:18| This is not shown to be effective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=2058)|
| 0:34:20| I think people forget why we even started bringing police into schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=2060)|
| 0:34:23| I'll remind you real quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=2063)|
| 0:34:24| Sandy Holt and Caliban, those are the first two to stick out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=2064)|
| 0:34:27| What happened?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=2067)|
| 0:34:28| White kids that were getting bullied brought guns to school and started blasting on teachers and students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=2068)|
| 0:34:32| That's actually why police were brought into the schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=2072)|
| 0:34:35| However, let's fast forward to the history.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=2075)|
| 0:34:37| Now you've got Sandy Holt, Caliban, we brought police in, and now let's start looking at the data.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=2077)|
| 0:34:41| What data starts showing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=2081)|
| 0:34:43| Data showed us that we started increasing our prison to school pipeline system when we started bringing cops into our schools that particularly targeted black and brown students, especially black and brown students from lower income communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=2083)|
| 0:34:53| So, again, data is showing more police is not the answer to the issues of our schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=2093)|
| 0:35:00| We need to really focus on wraparound care services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=2100)|
| 0:35:03| So for all the elected people that's on the ballot this year, pay attention because this is what we want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=2103)|
| 0:35:08| We want to see someone platform on their campaign trail something about wraparound care services like mental health professionals and therapists.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=2108)|
| 0:35:15| You know, Councilwoman Parker has tried to initiate HART.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=2115)|
| 0:35:19| It's not hard for a county member to pick up the same thing because that's what that is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=2119)|
| 0:35:22| It's a crisis response care and service that could easily be implemented into our school system at the same time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=2122)|
| 0:35:28| As I stated before, we need to address food and medical deserts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=2128)|
| 0:35:31| East Knoxville, 37914, 37915, these 37914, these areas are known as actually having true food apartheid issues because we don't have a fresh grocery store in the community unless you go all the way down Asheville Highway to Kroger's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=2131)|
| 0:35:45| That's the first real available food store for the East Knoxville area in general.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=2145)|
| 0:35:49| So we have to address that concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=2149)|
| 0:35:51| And more importantly, we don't have a hospital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=2151)|
| 0:35:54| We don't even have a health department location in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=2154)|
| 0:35:58| We have a lot of community members who are worried about surviving a 911 call long enough to make it to the closest hospital, which will unfortunately now be Fort Sanders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=2158)|
| 0:36:07| Because you close this one over to the south side and you close St. Mary's to create basically a miniature cop city is what we have at this point going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=2167)|
| 0:36:13| So you all really need to look at the issues that this community is facing and stop dumping money into the police.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=2173)|
| 0:36:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=2183)|
| 0:36:25| Item 16.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=2185)|
| 0:36:26| If you put that up on the screen, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=2186)|
| 0:36:31| Miss Avery.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=2191)|
| 0:36:33| Yeah, I see it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=2193)|
| 0:36:36| Wait for you to start the clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=2196)|
| 0:36:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=2197)|
| 0:36:43| For sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=2203)|
| 0:36:44| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=2204)|
| 0:36:45| So item 16, we want to know what this training equipment is, because the other concern that we have is that we have seen our police departments take surplus military equipment, which again, what reason does a police department have to have surplus military equipment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=2205)|
| 0:36:58| Are we having Afghanistan right here in Knoxville?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=2218)|
| 0:37:00| Are we doing Iraq in Knoxville?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=2220)|
| 0:37:02| If the answer is no, then the question is, what reason can the police departments of Knoxville, Knox County explain their necessity of needing this type of training equipment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=2222)|
| 0:37:11| Would it been so vague and not direct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=2231)|
| 0:37:13| We have to assume, unfortunately, this is probably some of the type of equipment that we're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=2233)|
| 0:37:17| Once again, we already had an article drop when we did a protest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=2237)|
| 0:37:20| Thompson Jr. expressed concern around a black cop flying around the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=2240)|
| 0:37:24| It takes one hundred thousand dollars, a minimum of taxpayers dollars just to fly it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=2244)|
| 0:37:28| And you outflow that thing multiple times while we protest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=2248)|
| 0:37:31| That's almost a million dollars you wasted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=2251)|
| 0:37:33| But more importantly, what was the reason of having such equipment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=2253)|
| 0:37:36| We know that the KPD has surplus training equipment that I use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=2256)|
| 0:37:40| I'm a disabled combat veteran that went to Afghanistan and we use a training module that trained us for Afghanistan, urban climate and environment to actually train on to shoot people with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=2260)|
| 0:37:51| And the kicker is KPD has that equipment in their possession.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=2271)|
| 0:37:54| For what? Literally, for what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=2274)|
| 0:37:57| What are you buying this equipment for?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=2277)|
| 0:37:59| What are you spending on? What is the purpose and need of it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=2279)|
| 0:38:01| So in my consideration is again asking, what do you want almost fifteen thousand dollars of training equipment for?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=2281)|
| 0:38:08| What are you using it for?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=2288)|
| 0:38:09| What is its purpose?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=2289)|
| 0:38:10| Why would it be served?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=2290)|
| 0:38:11| And more importantly, where are you getting it from as far as your government resources and intel that you're collecting the information and the equipment from to bring into our facilities, into our cops' possession and into their hands for training?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=2291)|
| 0:38:22| I yield the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=2302)|
| 0:38:24| Thank you, Ms. Severy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=2304)|
| 0:38:29| And the final item is item 17.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=2309)|
| 0:38:33| You know it, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=2313)|
| 0:38:34| The floor is yours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=2314)|
| 0:38:36| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=2316)|
| 0:38:37| And so last but not least, we see one hundred thousand dollars again coming into the highway testing patrol along with Knox County Sheriff Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=2317)|
| 0:38:45| And again, we're going to express the concerns of seeing this overfunding of bloated budgeting into our police departments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=2325)|
| 0:38:51| And let's not forget, this is a police department that can't even maintain its own equipment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=2331)|
| 0:38:55| We found out that two young men was running around busting out windows and stealing police equipment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=2335)|
| 0:39:01| I'm trying to understand this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=2341)|
| 0:39:02| You all tell us as the constituent public that we have a due diligence to protect our equipment and our weapons and our cars, but then the police department literally cannot do the same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=2342)|
| 0:39:11| And I'm just trying to understand how do you have a double standard of enforcement where your police department can't even maintain their equipment, but then we as the public are supposed to maintain our equipment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=2351)|
| 0:39:19| Or we can be charged a fine for the same crimes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=2359)|
| 0:39:21| You know, we talked about this cop that got killed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=2361)|
| 0:39:24| I find it interesting that we have not seen a single body cam footage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=2364)|
| 0:39:27| I don't believe anything the police say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=2367)|
| 0:39:29| I really don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=2369)|
| 0:39:30| Because after having some of the experiences I've had with our police departments, I'm very convinced that most of the time you're probably telling some type of lie or you're telling an alternate story or truth to the matter of the fact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=2370)|
| 0:39:38| And so I just think it's interesting how we are honoring this cop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=2378)|
| 0:39:41| Maybe not saying he doesn't deserve such honors, but the irony is that we have not seen any evidence of what happened on that call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=2381)|
| 0:39:48| Still waiting for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=2388)|
| 0:39:49| I'm dying to see it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=2389)|
| 0:39:50| And maybe that's not your jurisdiction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=2390)|
| 0:39:51| Maybe that's Charm Allen's jurisdiction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=2391)|
| 0:39:53| But, you know, given her history as a corrupted district attorney, I highly doubt we'll really see any true faithfulness from her office in the same matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=2393)|
| 0:39:59| But again, why are we over bloating the budget for our police departments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=2399)|
| 0:40:03| We have so many crises and so many needs right here in our own communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=2403)|
| 0:40:07| Taxpayers have been demanding certain issues and certain concerns to be addressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=2407)|
| 0:40:11| And yet and still pay attention, Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=2411)|
| 0:40:13| Your money's been prioritized to a police department that takes up over 42 percent of the budget on the city and the county side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=2413)|
| 0:40:19| So they're well funded for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=2419)|
| 0:40:21| But, you know, it's not funded housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=2421)|
| 0:40:22| You know it's not funded public transportation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=2422)|
| 0:40:24| You know it's not funded grocery stores.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=2424)|
| 0:40:26| You know it's not funded medical services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=2426)|
| 0:40:28| You know it's not funded a whole lot of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=2428)|
| 0:40:30| Education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=2430)|
| 0:40:31| It's multiple things we could spend that money on instead of a bloated police department, as I said before, who is unaccountable for their actions and behavior.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=2431)|
| 0:40:37| I yield my time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=2437)|
| 0:40:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=2441)|
| 0:40:42| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=2442)|
| 0:40:45| Our next speaker on public forum is Keith Britt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=2445)|
| 0:40:53| Identify yourself, please, and county of residence, and you will have three minutes to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=2453)|
| 0:40:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=2458)|
| 0:40:59| Keith Britt, 506 Milton Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=2459)|
| 0:41:01| I'll be brief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=2461)|
| 0:41:03| I'm here to discuss your legislative priorities that you'll be sending up to the state delegation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=2463)|
| 0:41:08| Most specifically the third item on that document on page one, TDOT investment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=2468)|
| 0:41:15| I don't disagree with anything that you've placed in that paragraph, but I'm hoping that you will refine it to be a little bit more specific and call out both Kingston Pike and North Shore Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=2475)|
| 0:41:26| Those are both state routes that have become choke points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=2486)|
| 0:41:31| They have several public schools on them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=2491)|
| 0:41:35| I think I counted seven to eight preschools directly tied to them, and traffic on those roads is becoming not only, it's not a problem, it's a serious safety concern here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=2495)|
| 0:41:46| I like what you've done in that section calling for community and pedestrian connectivity, but I am a pedestrian on those roads, and I'm able to walk on the sidewalk, but it's unsafe to cross the street right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=2506)|
| 0:42:03| We just got done with Greek Fest, and that was a, I mean, I saw at least three strollers almost get hit by cars during Greek Fest, and that's probably the slowest section of Kingston Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=2523)|
| 0:42:15| My kids' preschool, I have to turn left off of Kingston Pike after you go through the North Shore intersection onto Dean Hill Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=2535)|
| 0:42:25| The way that the traffic flows through there, I know that's supposed to be addressed by 2028, but it's a problem right now to where cars are nearly coming into head-on collisions trying to get into that turning lane because it's serving two directions at the same time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=2545)|
| 0:42:40| So I don't have any specific solutions that I'm calling for, but I'm hoping that you'll call out those two specific state routes as severe problems in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=2560)|
| 0:42:51| It's holding back, not only is it a traffic and a pedestrian safety problem, it's holding back business investment right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=2571)|
| 0:42:58| I'm actually a party defendant in a lawsuit right now because I opposed a Taco Bell on Kingston Pike, and so now I'm being sued by Taco Bell for getting that turned away at City Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=2578)|
| 0:43:10| I don't have any opposition to Taco Bell, it's delicious, but the side of the road on Kingston Pike that they were proposing building it on would have absolutely been a death trap for an elementary school that it was proposed to go right next to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=2590)|
| 0:43:24| So literally, business development is being held back by the traffic patterns on those two state routes right now, and I'm hoping that you can convince our state delegation to address those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=2604)|
| 0:43:36| I know Senator Massey would probably be very, I don't know, amenable to those calls for help. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=2616)|
| 0:43:46| Thank you. Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=2626)|
| 0:43:48| And our last speaker is Greg Mills. Mr. Mills?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=2628)|
| 0:44:07| Hi. I see that you have signed up for two items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=2647)|
| 0:44:10| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=2650)|
| 0:44:11| All right. To continue with the consistency then, I'll allow you two minutes on each item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=2651)|
| 0:44:16| If you would identify yourself and your county of residence, and we'll post item 25 first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=2656)|
| 0:44:25| They kind of work together, so could I just have four minutes total?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=2665)|
| 0:44:28| Yes, sir. That would be acceptable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=2668)|
| 0:44:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=2670)|
| 0:44:31| My name is Greg Mills, and I'm a resident of Knox County, and I'd like to speak on item 25, specifically the rental assistance funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=2671)|
| 0:44:40| And my issue is I have no problem with you accepting it. I'm sure it can help some people out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=2680)|
| 0:44:45| But what I don't see on the agenda is anything to solve the housing issue long term, and so I'm sure you're going to have to do this again pretty soon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=2685)|
| 0:44:55| So anyway, I've got three ideas for you to really maybe start making housing a little more affordable instead of just sitting back and watching what's going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=2695)|
| 0:45:05| First, item 52, why not ask the state to, you know, rein in UT and make them grow in a more responsible manner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=2705)|
| 0:45:15| and have a kind of a better student-to-student housing ratio than what they've demonstrated over the last couple of years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=2715)|
| 0:45:22| I think that would help quite a bit of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=2722)|
| 0:45:26| And second, why not go ahead and update the RA and RAE zones to prohibit not the ownership activity but the economic activity of charging rentals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=2726)|
| 0:45:40| You know, that'll get – I went to a meeting last week, and I think they said that nationwide the institutions are expected to own| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=2740)|
| 0:45:48| over 50 percent of the single-family homes by the end of the decade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=2748)|
| 0:45:52| So you need to start addressing that, you know, pretty soon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=2752)|
| 0:45:56| And I think if you just focus on the economic issue right and not the ownership right, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=2756)|
| 0:46:02| there's all kinds of things that are banned currently in that zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=2762)|
| 0:46:05| I think there's only about two dozen things I can do, where if it was a zone for commercial, there's thousands of things I could do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=2765)|
| 0:46:12| So, you know, you can grandfather in the ones that are there, but, you know, this –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=2772)|
| 0:46:17| you know, they're still doing the – you know, up at the Washington, D.C.,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=2777)|
| 0:46:20| and everywhere they're still doing the bank bailouts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=2780)|
| 0:46:23| I think all of us are on the hook, because what I saw Larry Summers' estimate was $100 each| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=2783)|
| 0:46:28| just for the Silicon Valley Bank bailout that they did earlier this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=2788)|
| 0:46:32| So it's not exactly a level playing field that is going on out there when that kind of, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=2792)|
| 0:46:38| market manipulation is going on at the federal level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=2798)|
| 0:46:41| So I hope you will, you know, either do it on your own or put it up to a vote in the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=2801)|
| 0:46:46| to start reining in these – this, you know, regression to the feudal system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=2806)|
| 0:46:51| that we seem to be bound and determined to go to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=2811)|
| 0:46:55| And the third point is just, you know, simply bring those two items up to the city the next meeting, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=2815)|
| 0:47:01| with them where it would make sense to do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=2821)|
| 0:47:05| But like I said, it's, you know, I don't really want to see item 25, you know, as a recurring theme.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=2825)|
| 0:47:10| I think it really needs to be, you know, addressed on a long-term basis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=2830)|
| 0:47:14| instead of just this Band-Aid approach that you're doing tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=2834)|
| 0:47:18| So I hope you'll consider those, you know, three ideas that I have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=2838)|
| 0:47:21| And I know it's going to make some people unhappy not being able to just charge rents and contribute nothing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=2841)|
| 0:47:27| but homelessness and economic malaise and higher housing prices to society,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=2847)|
| 0:47:31| but it's time, you know, they got stood up to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=2851)|
| 0:47:35| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=2855)|
| 0:47:36| Thank you. Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=2856)|

| 0:47:44| the speakers that we've heard from are the ones that are directed directly toward agenda items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=2864)|
| 0:47:50| At the end of the business still in front of us, then we will have a public forum,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=2870)|
| 0:47:58| and the next speaker will be called on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=2878)|
| 0:48:02| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=2882)|

| 0:50:48| And we'll continue after the procedure is read.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=3048)|
| 0:50:54| The clerk will call the roll, and as your name is called,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=3054)|
| 0:50:58| you may nominate a candidate or pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231023?start=3058)|
