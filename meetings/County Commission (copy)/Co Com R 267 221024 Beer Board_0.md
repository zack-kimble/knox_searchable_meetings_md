| 0:07:27| But you had a question, Mr. Larson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-beer-board?start=447)|
| 0:07:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-beer-board?start=452)|
| 0:07:33| And just from the Sheriff's Department, in the month of September,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-beer-board?start=453)|
| 0:07:39| you conducted, what, over 40 inspections of facilities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-beer-board?start=459)|
| 0:07:46| and those folks did the proper procedure and checked the ID?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-beer-board?start=466)|
| 0:07:51| I believe that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-beer-board?start=471)|
| 0:07:53| I think it was 41 that I calculated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-beer-board?start=473)|
| 0:07:55| So there was 41, and there's three that failed to check the ID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-beer-board?start=475)|
| 0:08:00| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-beer-board?start=480)|
| 0:08:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-beer-board?start=481)|
| 0:08:02| Because this is your second offense now, within 18 months,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-beer-board?start=482)|
| 0:08:06| you have an option, because you pleaded guilty to the offense of selling beer to a minor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-beer-board?start=486)|
| 0:08:12| you can take a 60-day suspension of your beer license from Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-beer-board?start=492)|
| 0:08:17| or a $1,500 fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-beer-board?start=497)|
| 0:08:19| Which do you choose?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-beer-board?start=499)|
| 0:08:21| The fine, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-beer-board?start=501)|
| 0:08:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-beer-board?start=503)|
| 0:08:26| Do you want to make a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-beer-board?start=506)|
| 0:08:27| No, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-beer-board?start=507)|
| 0:08:28| I just have a question before your motion, if that's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-beer-board?start=508)|
| 0:08:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-beer-board?start=510)|
| 0:08:32| We've had Casa de Gallo here a couple of times before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-beer-board?start=512)|
| 0:08:37| but there are three different Casa de Gallos,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-beer-board?start=517)|
| 0:08:39| and I'm pretty sure there are three different owners, three different structures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-beer-board?start=519)|
| 0:08:43| Is that accurate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-beer-board?start=523)|
| 0:08:44| Can you just explain?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-beer-board?start=524)|
| 0:08:45| Because we've seen this name more than a few times,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-beer-board?start=525)|
| 0:08:48| and I think the Hardin Valley one is, like, on its third or fourth offense,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-beer-board?start=528)|
| 0:08:51| and Rocky Hill is on its first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-beer-board?start=531)|
| 0:08:53| And I just want to clarify for the public that these are different entities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-beer-board?start=533)|
| 0:08:57| Yeah, it's a family business, but it's a different owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-beer-board?start=537)|
| 0:08:59| So each one is owned independently of itself and has a different beer license| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-beer-board?start=539)|
| 0:09:03| with a different beer license holder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-beer-board?start=543)|
| 0:09:06| Well, the beer permit is linked to two locations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-beer-board?start=546)|
| 0:09:12| and Casa de Gallo is a different owner, like, separately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-beer-board?start=552)|
| 0:09:16| So which two beer permits are linked?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-beer-board?start=556)|
| 0:09:19| Hardin Valley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-beer-board?start=559)|
| 0:09:22| And Rocky Hill?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-beer-board?start=562)|
| 0:09:24| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-beer-board?start=564)|
| 0:09:25| Or you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-beer-board?start=565)|
| 0:09:26| Choto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-beer-board?start=566)|
| 0:09:27| So Choto and Hardin Valley are the same beer permit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-beer-board?start=567)|
| 0:09:31| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-beer-board?start=571)|
| 0:09:32| So I guess my question is, if it's the same beer permit, why is this a second offense?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-beer-board?start=572)|
| 0:09:35| Because I think Hardin Valley is on its third.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-beer-board?start=575)|
| 0:09:41| Director Boog, could you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-beer-board?start=581)|
| 0:09:42| It's by location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-beer-board?start=582)|
| 0:09:44| So it's not by permit holder?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-beer-board?start=584)|
| 0:09:46| No, the permit holder at the location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-beer-board?start=586)|
| 0:09:49| It's a combination there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-beer-board?start=589)|
| 0:09:52| For instance, Casey's, they've got permits all over wherever Pilot was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-beer-board?start=592)|
| 0:09:58| but they've got the different locations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-beer-board?start=598)|
| 0:10:00| and they'll answer to any violations at a location even though Casey's is the owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-beer-board?start=600)|
| 0:10:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-beer-board?start=605)|
| 0:10:06| That makes sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-beer-board?start=606)|
| 0:10:07| I'll just say this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-beer-board?start=607)|
| 0:10:09| The ownership group from Hardin Valley, I don't remember,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-beer-board?start=609)|
| 0:10:15| I don't recall off the top of my head their first names,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-beer-board?start=615)|
| 0:10:17| but they were here just a few months ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-beer-board?start=617)|
| 0:10:19| and I think they were here on their third offense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-beer-board?start=619)|
| 0:10:22| I'm pretty sure if I remember that correctly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-beer-board?start=622)|
| 0:10:25| And I had a lengthy conversation with them outside and said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-beer-board?start=625)|
| 0:10:30| you guys have to figure out how to get it together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-beer-board?start=630)|
| 0:10:33| We take this really seriously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-beer-board?start=633)|
| 0:10:35| And yet here we are again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-beer-board?start=635)|
| 0:10:37| I know it's a different circumstance and a different operation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-beer-board?start=637)|
| 0:10:40| but, like, this to me is terrible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-beer-board?start=640)|
| 0:10:44| And I am a fan and I am a customer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-beer-board?start=644)|
| 0:10:46| but the Don Gallo family of restaurants has been here collectively six times in a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-beer-board?start=646)|
| 0:10:53| At some point, somebody's got to figure something out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-beer-board?start=653)|
| 0:10:56| because what's going to happen is this beer board is going to get to the point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-beer-board?start=656)|
| 0:10:59| where they're just going to revoke the license altogether,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-beer-board?start=659)|
| 0:11:01| and it's going to get to a point where it's not just a fine anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-beer-board?start=661)|
| 0:11:05| So all I can say is please go back to your owners, go back to your staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-beer-board?start=665)|
| 0:11:09| go back to your entire organization and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-beer-board?start=669)|
| 0:11:14| this is really serious, because we take it seriously,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-beer-board?start=674)|
| 0:11:17| the Sheriff's Department take it seriously,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-beer-board?start=677)|
| 0:11:19| and I guarantee you if you've been here this many times,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-beer-board?start=679)|
| 0:11:21| they're going to come again and again and again| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-beer-board?start=681)|
| 0:11:23| and double check you're doing the right thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-beer-board?start=683)|
| 0:11:25| So that's all I can say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-beer-board?start=685)|
| 0:11:26| Thank you for the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-beer-board?start=686)|
| 0:11:31| Yield back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-beer-board?start=691)|
| 0:11:32| No, I'm wondering if there's any more discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-beer-board?start=692)|
| 0:11:39| I do have a question, actually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-beer-board?start=699)|
| 0:11:42| Dr. Boock, do I understand that one beer permit can be used at several locations?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-beer-board?start=702)|
| 0:11:50| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-beer-board?start=710)|
| 0:11:51| Each location has its own separate permit, its own separate licensee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-beer-board?start=711)|
| 0:11:57| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-beer-board?start=717)|
| 0:11:58| Just like Casey's or Pilot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-beer-board?start=718)|
| 0:12:01| So is it appropriate then to have the deeds of one store fall upon the deeds of another, so to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-beer-board?start=721)|
| 0:12:13| I'm just curious, since it's separate management, if that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-beer-board?start=733)|
| 0:12:17| Well, no, if that were the case,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-beer-board?start=737)|
| 0:12:19| then the first violation that Pilot had back when Pilot had the stores,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-beer-board?start=739)|
| 0:12:23| you'd have taken away their rights on every Pilot food store across the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-beer-board?start=743)|
| 0:12:29| which is not what was intended here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-beer-board?start=749)|
| 0:12:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-beer-board?start=751)|
| 0:12:32| So actually each, and I appreciate your point, Commissioner Jay, very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-beer-board?start=752)|
| 0:12:38| I appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-beer-board?start=758)|
| 0:12:39| But each store actually stands on its own license and on its own merits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-beer-board?start=759)|
| 0:12:47| So I hate that your sister stores are having a problem, too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-beer-board?start=767)|
| 0:12:51| but right now we're really talking to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-beer-board?start=771)|
| 0:12:53| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-beer-board?start=773)|
| 0:12:54| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-beer-board?start=774)|
| 0:12:58| Mr. Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-beer-board?start=778)|
| 0:12:59| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-beer-board?start=779)|
| 0:13:01| I'd like to make a motion that seeing that Don Gallo pleaded guilty to the offense| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-beer-board?start=781)|
| 0:13:07| and is willing to accept a $1,500 fine, I make a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-beer-board?start=787)|
| 0:13:12| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-beer-board?start=792)|
| 0:13:15| Motion by Schoonmaker, second by Mr. Ratt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-beer-board?start=795)|
| 0:13:19| Is there any further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-beer-board?start=799)|
| 0:13:23| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-beer-board?start=803)|
| 0:13:25| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-beer-board?start=805)|
| 0:13:26| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-beer-board?start=806)|

| 0:14:19| Excuse me, they'll get a letter from the clerk's office with their outline where to pay the fee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-beer-board?start=859)|

| 0:15:15| You saw the prior hearing, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-beer-board?start=915)|
| 0:15:18| So the same procedure for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-beer-board?start=918)|

| 0:15:41| detectives with the Knox County Organized Retail Crime Unit conducted an underage beer sale at Country Burrito| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-beer-board?start=941)|
| 0:15:46| located at 10636 Hardin Valley Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-beer-board?start=946)|
| 0:15:49| The arrestee failed to look at the underage person's ID and served him a bottle of Corona beer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-beer-board?start=949)|
| 0:15:54| The arrestee was misdemeanor cited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-beer-board?start=954)|
| 0:15:57| Did you understand the allegation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-beer-board?start=957)|
| 0:15:59| Do you admit it or deny it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-beer-board?start=959)|
| 0:16:01| We admit it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-beer-board?start=961)|
| 0:16:02| Say into the microphone if you could, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-beer-board?start=962)|
| 0:16:05| We admit it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-beer-board?start=965)|
| 0:16:06| Is there anything you'd like to address to the beer board at this time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-beer-board?start=966)|
| 0:16:10| We're working on having a preshift meeting with the staff members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-beer-board?start=970)|
| 0:16:14| We have ordered a new ID scanner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-beer-board?start=974)|

| 0:16:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-beer-board?start=991)|
| 0:16:32| I turn it back over to you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-beer-board?start=992)|
| 0:16:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-beer-board?start=995)|
| 0:16:36| You're welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-beer-board?start=996)|
| 0:16:37| Can we have a report from the Sheriff's Department?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-beer-board?start=997)|
| 0:16:40| I'm sorry?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-beer-board?start=1000)|
| 0:16:41| Could you repeat again what had happened?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-beer-board?start=1001)|
| 0:16:44| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-beer-board?start=1004)|
| 0:16:45| Also, I'd like to point out that this appears that it may be like a second offense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-beer-board?start=1005)|
| 0:16:51| I thought it was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-beer-board?start=1011)|
| 0:16:52| I think their first offense included a margarita, so that was prior to our changeover.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-beer-board?start=1012)|
| 0:16:57| But on September 19, 2022, at approximately 1700 hours,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-beer-board?start=1017)|
| 0:17:02| detectives with the Sheriff's Office organized retail crime unit conducted an underage beer sale| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-beer-board?start=1022)|
| 0:17:07| at a country burrito located at 10636 Hardin Valley Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-beer-board?start=1027)|
| 0:17:11| The arrestee failed to look at the underage person's ID and served them a bottle of Corona beer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-beer-board?start=1031)|
| 0:17:17| And the person was misdemeanor cited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-beer-board?start=1037)|
| 0:17:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-beer-board?start=1040)|
| 0:17:22| A question for our law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-beer-board?start=1042)|
| 0:17:24| So is this actually a first or second citation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-beer-board?start=1044)|
| 0:17:28| First of all, the first one we did to do anything was we had to go to the state beverage board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-beer-board?start=1048)|
| 0:17:41| and they did whatever they did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-beer-board?start=1061)|
| 0:17:43| I don't know at that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-beer-board?start=1063)|
| 0:17:45| So at that point, the law was that we had no jurisdiction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-beer-board?start=1065)|
| 0:17:48| So as far in my mind, as far as we're concerned, this is a first offense| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-beer-board?start=1068)|
| 0:17:52| because the state did whatever the state did on the margarita sale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-beer-board?start=1072)|
| 0:17:57| So technically, in my mind, this would be a first offense,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-beer-board?start=1077)|
| 0:18:01| even though they've been caught with their hand in a cookie jar twice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-beer-board?start=1081)|
| 0:18:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-beer-board?start=1086)|
| 0:18:07| Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-beer-board?start=1087)|
| 0:18:09| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-beer-board?start=1089)|
| 0:18:10| Sheriff's Office, how long ago was that that the state got involved?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-beer-board?start=1090)|
| 0:18:15| I want to say it was like a month prior, but I'm not going to have it in front of me right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-beer-board?start=1095)|
| 0:18:21| so I can't swear to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-beer-board?start=1101)|
| 0:18:22| You mean of this year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-beer-board?start=1102)|
| 0:18:23| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-beer-board?start=1103)|
| 0:18:26| How was it longer than that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-beer-board?start=1106)|
| 0:18:28| It was before redistricting, as I recall, the first one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-beer-board?start=1108)|
| 0:18:32| Yeah, I mean, it was before the changeover as far as the alcohol goes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-beer-board?start=1112)|
| 0:18:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-beer-board?start=1117)|
| 0:18:38| And as I recall, I followed some of those pleadings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-beer-board?start=1118)|
| 0:18:41| and they were summoned to Nashville to deal with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-beer-board?start=1121)|
| 0:18:46| So they under-| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-beer-board?start=1126)|
| 0:18:48| It's probably been handled by the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-beer-board?start=1128)|
| 0:18:50| It was handled by the state,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-beer-board?start=1130)|
| 0:18:51| and there were summons that they were to appear for a hearing in Nashville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-beer-board?start=1131)|
| 0:18:54| So they paid some prices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-beer-board?start=1134)|
| 0:18:56| I don't know what the final, I don't know what the state finally did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-beer-board?start=1136)|
| 0:19:00| I don't either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-beer-board?start=1140)|
| 0:19:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-beer-board?start=1142)|
| 0:19:03| Is there anyone else before I turn it over to District 3?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-beer-board?start=1143)|
| 0:19:07| Commissioner Oster.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-beer-board?start=1147)|
| 0:19:10| So we will treat this, Director Book, as a first offense for us, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-beer-board?start=1150)|
| 0:19:15| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-beer-board?start=1155)|
| 0:19:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-beer-board?start=1156)|
| 0:19:17| Even though this is a first offense in front of us, this is your second, apparently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-beer-board?start=1157)|
| 0:19:23| When you went to the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-beer-board?start=1163)|
| 0:19:25| So I just ask that you really be paying attention| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-beer-board?start=1165)|
| 0:19:28| and you really take care of what's happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-beer-board?start=1168)|
| 0:19:31| I'm just going to reiterate what Commissioner Jay said to the previous people standing up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-beer-board?start=1171)|
| 0:19:36| Just be extremely careful and be paying attention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-beer-board?start=1176)|
| 0:19:39| Take that extra couple seconds to just check everything out, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-beer-board?start=1179)|
| 0:19:43| So I'm going to ask you if you want to do a 30-day suspension or a $1,000 fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-beer-board?start=1183)|
| 0:19:51| What day of the fine?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-beer-board?start=1191)|
| 0:19:52| The $1,000 fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-beer-board?start=1192)|
| 0:19:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-beer-board?start=1193)|
| 0:19:54| I'll make a motion for a $1,000 fine to Country Burrito for their first offense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-beer-board?start=1194)|
| 0:20:05| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-beer-board?start=1205)|
| 0:20:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-beer-board?start=1207)|
| 0:20:09| Motion by Oster, second by Frazier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-beer-board?start=1209)|

| 0:22:11| We also suspended the team member for one week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-beer-board?start=1331)|
| 0:22:15| We do take this very seriously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-beer-board?start=1335)|
