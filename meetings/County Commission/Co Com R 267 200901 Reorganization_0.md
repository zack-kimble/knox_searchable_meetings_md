| 0:12:41| We will then go into recess on each of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=761)|
| 0:12:47| And the chairs of those committees will take ownership of the meeting, run that meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=767)|
| 0:12:53| and elect the chair and the vice chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=773)|
| 0:12:57| And then we will come back and we will reconvene the full commission and we'll call the order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=777)|
| 0:13:01| So we will, is that, am I missing anything here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=781)|
| 0:13:09| We need to start with, which committee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=789)|
| 0:13:17| So we'll start with the Cable TV Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=797)|
| 0:13:21| And everyone is on that committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=801)|
| 0:13:25| David, just to clarify.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=805)|
| 0:13:29| We're going to go out of this one and into that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=809)|
| 0:13:33| So we call this one, we just recess this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=813)|
| 0:13:37| Recess this one and then convene this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=817)|
| 0:13:39| Just double checking we're doing it the right way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=819)|
| 0:13:41| So we will recess the County Commission meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=821)|
| 0:13:47| And then we will call to order the Cable TV Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=827)|
| 0:13:51| Everyone is a member of that committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=831)|
| 0:13:53| We will open up nominations for the chairman of that committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=833)|
| 0:13:59| Current chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=839)|
| 0:14:01| Current chair is Commissioner Beeler via Zoom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=841)|
| 0:14:04| So we will open up nominations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=844)|
| 0:14:06| And just like we did before, we'll go through a round of nominations for chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=846)|
| 0:14:10| And then a round of nominations for vice chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=850)|
| 0:14:12| And then we will, actually we'll do chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=852)|
| 0:14:16| And then the chair will take ownership of the meeting and find the vice chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=856)|
| 0:14:20| So we'll start with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=860)|
| 0:14:21| And we'll start with nominations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=861)|

| 0:14:25| Do you want to do roll call or just let people go?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=865)|
| 0:14:29| I think we have to do roll call because he's on electronic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=869)|
| 0:14:33| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=873)|
| 0:14:35| Well, the rules say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=875)|

| 0:14:40| Any vacancy committees?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=880)|
| 0:14:42| Any vacancy committees?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=882)|
| 0:14:44| Yeah, you're starting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=884)|
| 0:14:45| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=885)|
| 0:14:47| So we don't need to go roll call, do we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=887)|
| 0:14:49| Can't we just make a nomination?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=889)|
| 0:14:51| Just a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=891)|
| 0:14:52| We're just double checking if we have to do roll call or not based upon electronic meeting rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=892)|
| 0:14:58| You do have to do roll call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=898)|
| 0:15:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=901)|
| 0:15:09| Mr. Law Director, if you could just give some clarification if we have to do this a special way because of the electronic meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=909)|
| 0:15:15| Could you use the mic?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=915)|
| 0:15:17| Like everything else on these COVID orders and this, there's ambiguity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=917)|
| 0:15:27| Because there's no, we're not filling a vacancy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=927)|
| 0:15:29| We're starting fresh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=929)|
| 0:15:31| And it just says by vote of the commission to fill these seats.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=931)|
| 0:15:37| That's the way I read it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=937)|
| 0:15:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=939)|
| 0:15:40| So we should be able to operate as normal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=940)|
| 0:15:42| It's not a vacancy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=942)|
| 0:15:44| You're not filling a hole that somebody left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=944)|
| 0:15:48| That's my interpretation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=948)|
| 0:15:50| The chair can interpret it however the chair wants to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=950)|
| 0:15:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=953)|
| 0:15:54| So we would go through the same process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=954)|
| 0:15:57| We would open up the nomination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=957)|
| 0:15:59| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=959)|
| 0:16:00| We'd go through the same process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=960)|
| 0:16:01| That's true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=961)|
| 0:16:02| You do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=962)|
| 0:16:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=963)|

| 0:16:08| I make a motion that Richie Beeler maintain chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=968)|

| 0:16:21| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=981)|

| 0:16:26| We don't need a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=986)|
| 0:16:27| Sorry about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=987)|
| 0:16:28| Commissioner Beeler, would you serve if elected again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=988)|
| 0:16:31| I will, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=991)|

| 0:20:36| and sort of start getting a sense of this, but we do need to nominate a chair| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=1236)|
| 0:20:42| and then have the meeting convene in a vice chair, so we'll open up nominations for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=1242)|
| 0:20:48| You need to let everybody know the only people that can nominate are people who are members of the committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=1248)|
| 0:20:52| Oh, we have to pick five and then pick a chair from that five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=1252)|

| 0:21:23| Who else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=1283)|
| 0:21:24| Commissioner Daley, do you want to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=1284)|
| 0:21:27| There's a new spot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=1287)|
| 0:21:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=1289)|
| 0:21:30| Well, there's three more empty spots, so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=1290)|
| 0:21:33| I'll serve again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=1293)|

| 0:21:43| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=1303)|
| 0:21:44| Biggs would serve, Hill would serve, and that would leave one additional spot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=1304)|
| 0:21:49| I'll do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=1309)|
| 0:21:51| Ms. Durrett?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=1311)|
| 0:21:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=1313)|
| 0:21:55| That is Commissioners Lundy, Daley, Biggs, Hill, and Durrett volunteering to serve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=1315)|
| 0:22:02| We'll now open the nominations for chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=1322)|
| 0:22:06| We've got to go out of session, and those four, five have to vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=1326)|
| 0:22:09| Oh, just those five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=1329)|
| 0:22:10| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=1330)|
| 0:22:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=1331)|
| 0:22:12| All right, we're going to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=1332)|
| 0:22:13| You're the chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=1333)|
| 0:22:14| You've got to go out of session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=1334)|
| 0:22:15| We're already out of session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=1335)|
| 0:22:16| No, no, back in session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=1336)|
| 0:22:17| Can I?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=1337)|
| 0:22:18| Point of order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=1338)|
| 0:22:19| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=1339)|
| 0:22:20| Typically, what we do is we set everybody into these committees, and then we go out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=1340)|
| 0:22:24| and into each committee to go back and select each chair and vice chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=1344)|
| 0:22:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=1347)|
| 0:22:28| We can do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=1348)|
| 0:22:29| And then you serve as chair until they vote as chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=1349)|
| 0:22:31| I see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=1351)|
| 0:22:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=1352)|
| 0:22:33| So.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=1353)|
| 0:22:34| Mr. Chairman, technically, the way the rules read that the Commission votes on these members,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=1354)|
| 0:22:38| so I think you should have a motion to have those five members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=1358)|
| 0:22:42| So what we'll do is we will entertain motions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=1362)|
| 0:22:45| We will look to fill all of these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=1365)|
| 0:22:47| We'll entertain motions to lock the people into those committees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=1367)|
| 0:22:50| Then we will recess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=1370)|
| 0:22:51| We'll go into each of those committees and pick a vice chair, a chair and a vice chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=1371)|
| 0:22:55| So the first, I would like to entertain, if somebody would entertain a motion to set the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=1375)|
| 0:23:00| five members of the court subcommittee as Commissioners Lundy, Daly, Biggs, Hill, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=1380)|
| 0:23:06| Durrett as members of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=1386)|
| 0:23:09| Motion to cease nominations and list this slate of candidates into the subcourt committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=1389)|
| 0:23:15| by acclamation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=1395)|
| 0:23:17| The motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=1397)|
| 0:23:18| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=1398)|
| 0:23:19| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=1399)|

| 0:26:46| That sets our insolvency board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=1606)|
| 0:26:48| We're going to move now to Legislative Affairs Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=1608)|
| 0:26:50| This is going to consist of five members of the County Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=1610)|
| 0:26:54| It's a one-year term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=1614)|
| 0:26:56| Members shall identify and monitor legislation at the state and federal levels that impact Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=1616)|
| 0:27:02| meet with state legislators regarding Knox County priorities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=1622)|
| 0:27:06| and provide legislative recommendations to the Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=1626)|
| 0:27:10| And show of hands, who was on that last year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=1630)|
| 0:27:16| Bussler, Daley, and Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=1636)|
| 0:27:20| Do you wish to remain on that committee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=1640)|
| 0:27:24| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=1644)|

| 0:27:34| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=1654)|
| 0:27:36| That leaves one spot open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=1656)|
| 0:27:38| I'd like to nominate Commissioner Lundy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=1658)|
| 0:27:40| Oh, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=1660)|
| 0:27:42| I'd still like to nominate Commissioner Lundy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=1662)|
| 0:27:44| Would you like to serve on that committee as well?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=1664)|
| 0:27:46| Sure, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=1666)|
| 0:27:48| Beeler, stay on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=1668)|
| 0:27:50| Beeler, stay on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=1670)|
| 0:27:52| Commissioner Beeler, were you on the Legislative Affairs last year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=1672)|
| 0:27:58| Yes, yes he was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=1678)|
| 0:28:00| Okay, would you like to remain on that or roll off and open this seat?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=1680)|
| 0:28:04| I could roll off and open that seat to one of the new commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=1684)|
| 0:28:08| Anybody else like to serve on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=1688)|
| 0:28:10| So right now we have Ms. Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=1690)|
| 0:28:14| Okay, so we have overbooked the flight by one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=1694)|
| 0:28:20| Commissioner Bussler, Daley, or Schoonmaker, would you like to pick a different committee or would you like to stay on this one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=1700)|
| 0:28:27| I would like to stay on because I'm on the Secretary of the TCCA Board, which we meet for Legislative Affairs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=1707)|
| 0:28:36| And so I have an office down there on the TCCA Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=1716)|
| 0:28:41| I will withdraw.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=1721)|
| 0:28:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=1723)|
| 0:28:49| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=1729)|
| 0:28:51| It's important that we keep our committees, this committee together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=1731)|
| 0:28:55| A lot of these people serve in roles in Nashville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=1735)|
| 0:28:59| And unfortunately in Nashville, us being one of the few term-limited municipalities, it's hard for us to get those seats and keep those seats.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=1739)|
| 0:29:13| So consistency is important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=1753)|
| 0:29:15| Thank you, Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=1755)|

| 0:29:31| Is there a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=1771)|
| 0:29:33| I make a motion to cease nominations and put forth this slate of nominees for selection by acclamation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=1773)|

| 0:29:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=1795)|
| 0:29:57| That sets the Legislative Affairs Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=1797)|
| 0:29:59| And then Rules Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=1799)|
| 0:30:01| One second while I get to that sheet, just to remind everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=1801)|
| 0:30:05| This consists of five members of the Knox County Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=1805)|
| 0:30:10| And it's to review the rules of the Commission and report its recommendations to the Commission by the regular November Commission meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=1810)|
| 0:30:16| Well, I think that's a little bit out of date in how it's written, but it can meet at any point throughout the year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=1816)|
| 0:30:22| I served on that last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=1822)|
| 0:30:24| I believe Carson Daley was also on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=1824)|
| 0:30:28| Who else was?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=1828)|
| 0:30:30| Bussler, Anders, and Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=1830)|
| 0:30:32| Bussler, Anders, and Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=1832)|

| 0:30:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=1842)|
| 0:30:44| So that opens up two additional slots if all three of us would like to stay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=1844)|
| 0:30:50| Are there anybody that would like to join the Rules Committee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=1850)|
| 0:30:54| There's a vehement head shake no from Ms. Durrett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=1854)|
| 0:30:58| Mr. Ward?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=1858)|
| 0:31:00| Come on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=1860)|

| 0:31:06| I'll serve if no one else is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=1866)|

| 0:31:32| I'd like to entertain a motion to set the Rules Committee membership with Commissioners Bussler, Daley, Jay, Hill, and Lundy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=1892)|

| 0:49:08| on to number eight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=2948)|
| 0:49:18| This is consideration of a resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=2958)|
| 0:49:20| of the Commission of Knox County, Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=2960)|
| 0:49:22| reappointing Commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=2962)|
| 0:49:24| to serve on the Knox County Investment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=2964)|
| 0:49:26| Committee along with the Chair of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=2966)|
| 0:49:28| the Commission. This is Resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=2968)|
| 0:49:30| R-20-9-104-SS.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=2970)|
| 0:49:36| The Investment Committee had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=2976)|
| 0:49:38| two members on it. It was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=2978)|
| 0:49:40| Commissioner Nystrom who is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=2980)|
| 0:49:42| not with us and Commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=2982)|
| 0:49:44| Schoonmaker, but your term| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=2984)|
| 0:49:46| ends this year. So I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=2986)|
| 0:49:48| you would be eligible for another term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=2988)|
| 0:49:50| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=2990)|
| 0:49:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=2992)|
| 0:49:54| Open the floor for nominations since| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=2994)|
| 0:49:56| there's just one vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=2996)|
| 0:49:58| There's two seats up, am I correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=2998)|
| 0:50:00| There's just one seat, actually. One seat, the Chairman| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=3000)|
| 0:50:02| and then one seat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=3002)|
| 0:50:04| Because we only get two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=3004)|
| 0:50:06| Commissioners, there's one School Board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=3006)|
| 0:50:08| member, the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=3008)|
| 0:50:10| Trustee, the Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=3010)|
| 0:50:12| Yeah, just one spot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=3012)|
| 0:50:14| I'd like to nominate Kyle Ward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=3014)|
| 0:50:16| Would you be willing to serve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=3016)|
| 0:50:18| on this committee? Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=3018)|
| 0:50:20| Is there any other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=3020)|
| 0:50:22| second to that motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=3022)|
| 0:50:24| Point of order, maybe, here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=3024)|
| 0:50:26| My sheet says Investment Committee is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=3026)|
| 0:50:28| the Commission Chair. Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=3028)|
| 0:50:30| It's the Commission Chairman plus one Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=3030)|
| 0:50:32| Plus one more. So there'll be a total| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=3032)|
| 0:50:34| of two members, so we're only filling one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=3034)|
| 0:50:36| We're missing a blank. Well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=3036)|
| 0:50:40| I think it's since the rules say that the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=3040)|
| 0:50:42| Chair is already on it that we don't vote on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=3042)|
| 0:50:44| that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=3044)|
| 0:50:46| So that was a motion by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=3046)|
| 0:50:48| Commissioner Biggs. Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=3048)|
| 0:50:50| I'll second it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=3050)|
| 0:50:52| I'll second it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=3052)|
| 0:50:54| I can do that, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=3054)|
| 0:50:56| I think I can do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=3056)|
| 0:50:58| Alright, we have a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=3058)|
| 0:51:00| Properly a motion on the floor to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=3060)|
| 0:51:02| appoint Commissioner Ward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=3062)|
| 0:51:04| Hold on one second here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=3064)|
| 0:51:06| Do you want to do it again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=3066)|
| 0:51:08| Smith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=3068)|
| 0:51:10| Would you want to serve again on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=3070)|
| 0:51:12| The Investment Committee or not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=3072)|
| 0:51:14| No, he wasn't on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=3074)|
| 0:51:16| Okay, I thought it was just you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=3076)|
| 0:51:18| No, I'm talking about years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=3078)|
| 0:51:20| When I was Chair, I was on the Investment Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=3080)|
| 0:51:22| Okay, we have a proper motion and a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=3082)|
| 0:51:24| second before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=3084)|
| 0:51:26| All in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=3086)|
| 0:51:28| Aye. All opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=3088)|
| 0:51:30| Please say no. Congratulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=3090)|
| 0:51:32| Commissioner Ward, you are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=3092)|
| 0:51:34| now a member of the Investment Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=3094)|
| 0:51:36| Madam Clerk,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=3096)|
| 0:51:38| would you please read the next item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=3098)|
| 0:51:43| This is consideration of a resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=3103)|

| 0:51:47| appointing Commissioners to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=3107)|

| 0:51:59| very heavy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=3119)|
| 0:52:01| lift when it comes to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=3121)|
| 0:52:03| committees. Pension and Retirement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=3123)|
| 0:52:05| Board is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=3125)|
| 0:52:07| like a whole other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=3127)|
| 0:52:09| Actually, Commissioner Smith, why don't you please explain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=3129)|
| 0:52:11| quickly, because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=3131)|
| 0:52:13| we've both been on that, but it's a big| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=3133)|
| 0:52:15| role.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=3135)|
| 0:52:19| It's simply the position| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=3139)|
| 0:52:21| where we vote on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=3141)|
| 0:52:23| guidelines and regulations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=3143)|

| 0:52:27| the pensions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=3147)|
| 0:52:29| It's a lot of numbers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=3149)|
| 0:52:31| a lot of math crunching,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=3151)|
| 0:52:33| and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=3153)|
| 0:52:35| the meetings can sometimes be long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=3155)|
| 0:52:39| I've really enjoyed it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=3159)|
| 0:52:41| I'm a numbers guy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=3161)|

| 0:52:51| rolling off, but Mr. Smith, would you be willing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=3171)|
| 0:52:53| to serve again in another| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=3173)|

| 0:53:01| I am also on that committee, but my| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=3181)|
| 0:53:03| term goes until 2022.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=3183)|
| 0:53:07| I'd like to nominate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=3187)|

| 0:53:13| Nomination by Commissioner Smith was seconded by Commissioner Biggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=3193)|
| 0:53:15| Would you be willing to serve on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=3195)|
| 0:53:17| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=3197)|
| 0:53:19| I'd like to now nominate Mr. Chair, Charlie Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=3199)|
| 0:53:25| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=3205)|
| 0:53:27| There doesn't have to be a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=3207)|
| 0:53:29| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=3209)|
| 0:53:31| Would you be willing to serve on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=3211)|
| 0:53:33| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=3213)|
| 0:53:35| Is there a fourth slot?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=3215)|
| 0:53:37| There are three slots, and I'm on there as the fourth slot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=3217)|
| 0:53:39| with two more years on the term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=3219)|
| 0:53:45| So that would set the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=3225)|
| 0:53:47| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=3227)|
| 0:53:49| It should be three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=3229)|
| 0:53:53| Is that 105?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=3233)|
| 0:53:55| Yeah, you've got an old copy, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=3235)|
| 0:54:01| You've got three slots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=3241)|
| 0:54:03| You've got two slots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=3243)|
| 0:54:09| I'm looking over at our team| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=3249)|
| 0:54:11| from the Commission, and they're saying three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=3251)|
| 0:54:13| They have two on their sheet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=3253)|
| 0:54:15| I've got three on my sheet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=3255)|
| 0:54:19| The agenda was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=3259)|
| 0:54:21| redone, and she just hasn't got the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=3261)|
| 0:54:23| updated agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=3263)|
| 0:54:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=3265)|
| 0:54:27| We have a couple of extra copies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=3267)|
| 0:54:29| We could bring those over just to make sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=3269)|

| 0:59:38| You need a spot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=3578)|
| 0:59:40| Okay. So the current,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=3580)|
| 0:59:42| right now we have Schoonmaker and Beeler| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=3582)|
| 0:59:44| and we have one spot left to fill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=3584)|
| 0:59:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=3586)|
| 0:59:50| Audit committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=3590)|
| 0:59:52| You already nominated Kyle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=3592)|
| 1:00:02| She said no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=3602)|
| 1:00:04| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=3604)|
| 1:00:06| So we have two of the three slots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=3606)|
| 1:00:08| Mr. Ward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=3608)|
| 1:00:10| do you want to serve or do you want me to serve?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=3610)|
| 1:00:12| I mean, I don't, it doesn't matter to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=3612)|
| 1:00:14| I mean, I would like to serve, but if you're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=3614)|
| 1:00:16| passionate about it, I'll...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=3616)|
| 1:00:18| It's just the committee I haven't sat on before, so I'm trying to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=3618)|
| 1:00:20| you know, make the rounds. I'll yield to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=3620)|
| 1:00:22| Is that okay? Yes, sir. Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=3622)|
| 1:00:24| Would you mind nominating me now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=3624)|
| 1:00:26| I nominate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=3626)|
| 1:00:28| Chairman J.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=3628)|
| 1:00:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=3630)|
| 1:00:32| Thank you. A second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=3632)|
| 1:00:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=3634)|
| 1:00:36| So we have Commissioner Schoonmaker,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=3636)|
| 1:00:38| Beeler, and J.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=3638)|
| 1:00:40| on the audit committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=3640)|
| 1:00:42| Do we have a motion to accept| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=3642)|
| 1:00:44| that motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=3644)|
| 1:00:46| from Commissioner Daley and a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=3646)|
| 1:00:48| Anyone? Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=3648)|
| 1:00:50| From Ms. Durrett. All in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=3650)|
| 1:00:52| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=3652)|
| 1:00:54| Any opposed? That sets number 10| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=3654)|
| 1:00:56| and approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=3656)|
| 1:00:58| Madam Clerk, moving on to number 11,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=3658)|
| 1:01:00| please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=3660)|
| 1:01:04| Excuse me, Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=3664)|
| 1:01:06| Chairman. Yes, sir. I've been informed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=3666)|
| 1:01:08| by the people that count that write| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=3668)|
| 1:01:10| these up that you have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=3670)|
| 1:01:12| to have, name one of those who's fulfilling| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=3672)|
| 1:01:14| his term. You've got the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=3674)|
| 1:01:16| names, but they want,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=3676)|
| 1:01:18| they feel they need, based on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=3678)|
| 1:01:20| resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=3680)|
| 1:01:22| Okay, so one of those three names| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=3682)|
| 1:01:24| needs to fulfill his term. The other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=3684)|
| 1:01:26| two are full terms. I have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=3686)|
| 1:01:28| a question about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=3688)|
| 1:01:30| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=3690)|
| 1:01:34| Over two years ago, we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=3694)|
| 1:01:36| changed the rules of the audit committee to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=3696)|
| 1:01:38| where the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=3698)|
| 1:01:40| term that you serve is not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=3700)|
| 1:01:42| determined by the term. It's determined| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=3702)|
| 1:01:44| by the service that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=3704)|
| 1:01:46| you have left on your commission position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=3706)|
| 1:01:48| So you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=3708)|
| 1:01:50| have two years left on yours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=3710)|
| 1:01:52| But the new person that gets appointed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=3712)|
| 1:01:54| that term now becomes what they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=3714)|
| 1:01:56| have left on theirs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=3716)|
| 1:01:58| That's a resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=3718)|
| 1:02:00| that Mr. Schumacher, Commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=3720)|
| 1:02:02| Schumacher, brought to us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=3722)|
| 1:02:04| over two years ago and was passed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=3724)|
| 1:02:06| So it would be my interpretation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=3726)|
| 1:02:08| that whoever is elected| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=3728)|
| 1:02:10| to this seat, that term| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=3730)|
| 1:02:12| on audit will be concurrent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=3732)|
| 1:02:14| with their term on commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=3734)|
| 1:02:16| So if that's the case, this resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=3736)|
| 1:02:18| would need to be rewritten| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=3738)|
| 1:02:20| to reflect that. No, it'll be fine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=3740)|
| 1:02:22| the way it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=3742)|
| 1:02:24| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=3744)|
| 1:02:26| If I'm hearing you, you're saying that this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=3746)|
| 1:02:28| is not written correctly because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=3748)|
| 1:02:30| there's nobody that would fulfill your term| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=3750)|
| 1:02:32| just for two years. Their term| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=3752)|
| 1:02:34| would be four years. Or whatever| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=3754)|
| 1:02:36| they have left. Or whatever they have left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=3756)|
| 1:02:38| So the motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=3758)|
| 1:02:40| could be amended| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=3760)|
| 1:02:42| to adopt this with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=3762)|
| 1:02:44| the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=3764)|
| 1:02:48| taking out the language of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=3768)|
| 1:02:50| to complete the unfulfilled| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=3770)|
| 1:02:52| term of Commissioner Randy Smith| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=3772)|
| 1:02:54| on said committee. Taking out that one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=3774)|
| 1:02:56| line. Could we pass a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=3776)|
| 1:02:58| Could we do a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=3778)|
| 1:03:00| substitute motion to do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=3780)|
| 1:03:02| Or could we amend the motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=3782)|
| 1:03:04| A friendly amendment to the motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=3784)|
| 1:03:06| that you gave Commissioner Daley?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=3786)|
| 1:03:08| I'll move.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=3788)|
| 1:03:10| Who was the second? Commissioner Durrett?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=3790)|
| 1:03:12| Daley and Durrett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=3792)|
| 1:03:14| So the motion is before you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=3794)|
| 1:03:16| number ten, striking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=3796)|
| 1:03:18| the language to complete the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=3798)|
| 1:03:20| term of Commissioner Randy Smith| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=3800)|
| 1:03:22| on said committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=3802)|
| 1:03:24| All in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=3804)|
| 1:03:26| I'm sorry, Commissioner Smith| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=3806)|
| 1:03:28| did you have something else you wanted to jump in on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=3808)|
| 1:03:30| No, I just want to get my light on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=3810)|
| 1:03:32| Would that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=3812)|
| 1:03:34| set the language appropriately?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=3814)|
| 1:03:36| They look| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=3816)|
| 1:03:38| over here that typed it up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=3818)|
| 1:03:40| and they said yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=3820)|
| 1:03:42| All in favor, please say aye. Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=3822)|
| 1:03:44| Any opposed? That sets the audit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=3824)|
| 1:03:46| committee. And thank you Commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=3826)|
| 1:03:49| for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=3829)|
| 1:03:53| Okay, Madam Clerk, number eleven.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=3833)|

| 1:14:36| And their family plays there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=4476)|
| 1:14:38| To me, that would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=4478)|
| 1:14:40| be something where somebody's familiar| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=4480)|
| 1:14:42| with the facilities and all that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=4482)|
| 1:14:44| Is that correct? You're out there almost every week| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=4484)|
| 1:14:46| playing? Not every week, but when we play| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=4486)|
| 1:14:48| we go out there. Let me read the fact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=4488)|
| 1:14:50| sheet. Right now, Commissioner Bustler| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=4490)|
| 1:14:52| is on it until 2022.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=4492)|
| 1:14:54| This would be the opening| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=4494)|
| 1:14:56| from Commissioner Carringer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=4496)|

| 1:15:10| Uh...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=4510)|
| 1:15:12| Let's see here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=4512)|

| 1:15:22| Management Company to advise and to make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=4522)|
| 1:15:24| recommendations to Knox County Parks and Rec's Director| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=4524)|
| 1:15:26| and to Knox County Commission on rules,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=4526)|
| 1:15:28| regulations, policies, administrative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=4528)|
| 1:15:30| and legislative matters pertaining to the operation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=4530)|
| 1:15:32| and maintenance of the Three Ridges Golf Course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=4532)|
| 1:15:34| Board will ensure that the golf course is operated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=4534)|
| 1:15:36| in a professional and ethical manner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=4536)|
| 1:15:38| It doesn't say anything in the fact sheet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=4538)|
| 1:15:40| about an appointment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=4540)|
| 1:15:42| by the Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=4542)|
| 1:15:44| So, this looks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=4544)|
| 1:15:46| on my...just on my| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=4546)|
| 1:15:48| face value, it looks like it's something we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=4548)|
| 1:15:50| appoint. I mean, that we would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=4550)|
| 1:15:52| go through all the same motions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=4552)|
| 1:15:54| Which we did with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=4554)|
| 1:15:56| Commissioner Bustler a couple years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=4556)|
| 1:15:58| Mr. Law Director, do you want to look at this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=4558)|
| 1:16:00| and just see? No, you've read enough there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=4560)|
| 1:16:02| I understand what it says and there's nothing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=4562)|
| 1:16:04| in the rules that say anything about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=4564)|
| 1:16:06| uh...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=4566)|
| 1:16:08| The Mayor certainly can make a recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=4568)|
| 1:16:10| to this body, but then this body| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=4570)|
| 1:16:12| the way I read everything, they've got to vote| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=4572)|
| 1:16:14| on a member| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=4574)|
| 1:16:16| of this Commission to serve on that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=4576)|
| 1:16:18| Three Ridges Board. But it's up to this Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=4578)|
| 1:16:20| but the Mayor's recommended one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=4580)|
| 1:16:22| and that's all I see it as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=4582)|
| 1:16:24| is a recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=4584)|
| 1:16:26| So, this is a recommendation by the Mayor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=4586)|
| 1:16:28| but this body can decide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=4588)|
| 1:16:30| to take that recommendation or change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=4590)|
| 1:16:32| its mind. So do we.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=4592)|
| 1:16:37| Do you want to serve on it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=4597)|
| 1:16:39| Were you asked or were you voluntold?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=4599)|
| 1:16:41| No, I was asked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=4601)|
| 1:16:43| and I said yes when I was asked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=4603)|
| 1:16:45| Are we sure that the Mayor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=4605)|
| 1:16:47| doesn't get an appointment and Commission gets an appointment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=4607)|
| 1:16:49| It says two members from Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=4609)|
| 1:16:51| Commission on New Year. It doesn't have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=4611)|
| 1:16:53| anything...it doesn't have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=4613)|
| 1:16:55| anything that says anything about the Mayor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=4615)|
| 1:16:57| in this fact sheet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=4617)|
| 1:16:59| Is that fact sheet the bylaws| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=4619)|
| 1:17:01| of the Three Ridges?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=4621)|
| 1:17:03| No, it has the legal authority. It has the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=4623)|
| 1:17:05| appointment. Well, actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=4625)|
| 1:17:07| the appointment says members recommended| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=4627)|
| 1:17:09| by Knox County Mayor approved by Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=4629)|
| 1:17:11| So actually it does, right at the top.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=4631)|
| 1:17:13| So it is by the Mayor. Sorry, I didn't see that first line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=4633)|
| 1:17:15| So, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=4635)|
| 1:17:17| Sorry about that. I read all the legalese| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=4637)|
| 1:17:19| and I didn't read the first line. So, never mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=4639)|
| 1:17:21| Is there a motion to approve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=4641)|
| 1:17:23| this resolution?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=4643)|
| 1:17:25| I believe there already is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=4645)|
| 1:17:27| Who is the first?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=4647)|
| 1:17:29| Commissioner Smith| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=4649)|
| 1:17:31| with a second by Commissioner Biggs. All in favor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=4651)|
| 1:17:33| please say aye. Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=4653)|
| 1:17:35| Aye. Only opposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=4655)|
| 1:17:37| I have one other bit of business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=4657)|
| 1:17:39| in the last Commission meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=4659)|
| 1:17:41| and Mr. Law Director| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=4661)|
| 1:17:43| I just want to make sure this is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=4663)|
| 1:17:45| that I could do this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=4665)|
| 1:17:47| in this meeting or do I need to wait?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=4667)|
| 1:17:49| In the last Commission meeting we talked about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=4669)|
| 1:17:51| forming an ad hoc committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=4671)|
| 1:17:53| to serve as a liaison| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=4673)|
| 1:17:55| between the Sheriff's Department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=4675)|
| 1:17:57| and the Merit Council and to come back to Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=4677)|
| 1:17:59| on an item that was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=4679)|
| 1:18:01| under a lot of discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=4681)|
| 1:18:03| Can I form| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=4683)|
| 1:18:05| that ad hoc committee now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=4685)|
| 1:18:07| No, I think you need to wait because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=4687)|
| 1:18:09| it's not on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=4689)|
| 1:18:11| So we need to add that to the September agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=4691)|
| 1:18:13| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=4693)|
| 1:18:15| Yes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=4695)|
| 1:18:17| one second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=4697)|
| 1:18:21| One second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=4701)|
| 1:18:27| Is there any other business before this body?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=4707)|
| 1:18:29| Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=4709)|
| 1:18:31| Thank you Mr. Chairman. I wanted to bring to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=4711)|
| 1:18:33| body's attention| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=4713)|
| 1:18:35| we have two committees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=4715)|
| 1:18:37| that make up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=4717)|
| 1:18:39| the Knox County Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=4719)|
| 1:18:41| One is the CAC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=4721)|
| 1:18:43| committee. The other is the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=4723)|
| 1:18:45| Ethics Committee and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=4725)|
| 1:18:47| apparently we just found out at the 11th| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=4727)|
| 1:18:49| hour that those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=4729)|
| 1:18:51| are classified as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=4731)|
| 1:18:53| membership by occupancy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=4733)|
| 1:18:55| So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=4735)|
| 1:18:57| in my situation I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=4737)|
| 1:18:59| served for four years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=4739)|
| 1:19:01| on the Ethics Committee and my| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=4741)|
| 1:19:03| intention was to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=4743)|
| 1:19:05| that end| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=4745)|
| 1:19:07| as of today and a new| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=4747)|
| 1:19:09| person, a new Commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=4749)|
| 1:19:11| have the opportunity to serve for another| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=4751)|
| 1:19:13| four years on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=4753)|
| 1:19:15| Ethics Committee just like we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=4755)|

| 1:19:19| But apparently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=4759)|
| 1:19:21| because of the resolution, the way it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=4761)|
| 1:19:23| worded, and this could go back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=4763)|
| 1:19:25| ten years, who knows what it is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=4765)|
| 1:19:27| it says that the CAC committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=4767)|
| 1:19:29| and the Ethics Committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=4769)|
| 1:19:31| is by occupancy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=4771)|
| 1:19:33| So I had one term| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=4773)|
| 1:19:35| as Commissioner, that ended, and I have now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=4775)|
| 1:19:37| a second term as Commissioner, but I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=4777)|
| 1:19:39| do not want to serve eight years on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=4779)|
| 1:19:41| the Ethics Committee. I think it would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=4781)|
| 1:19:43| beneficial for one of the newer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=4783)|
| 1:19:45| to be able to be on that. So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=4785)|
| 1:19:47| what I'm going to have our law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=4787)|
| 1:19:49| department do next week is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=4789)|
| 1:19:51| to do a resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=4791)|
| 1:19:53| for the September meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=4793)|
| 1:19:55| that would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=4795)|
| 1:19:57| clarify the information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=4797)|
| 1:19:59| for the Ethics Committee and for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=4799)|
| 1:20:01| CAC committee, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=4801)|
| 1:20:03| do we want to go ahead and find out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=4803)|
| 1:20:05| who possibly wants to fill| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=4805)|
| 1:20:07| that post for the next four| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=4807)|
| 1:20:09| years so they can be included in the resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=4809)|
| 1:20:11| for our September meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=4811)|
| 1:20:14| I don't think we can get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=4814)|
| 1:20:16| into that business because it's not on the agenda, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=4816)|
| 1:20:18| everybody has heard that there will be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=4818)|
| 1:20:20| an opening on the Ethics Committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=4820)|
| 1:20:22| and we'll fill it at the next meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=4822)|
| 1:20:24| so be reading up on whether that's something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=4824)|
| 1:20:26| you'd be interested in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=4826)|
| 1:20:30| CAC?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=4830)|
| 1:20:34| No, it's just one non-voting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=4834)|
| 1:20:36| member from the County Commission serves on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=4836)|
| 1:20:38| Ethics Committee. So we'll wait until| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=4838)|
| 1:20:40| that September meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=4840)|

| 1:20:54| Regardless, we're going to have to deal with it in September.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=4854)|
| 1:20:56| Okay, so we'll deal with that in September,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=4856)|
| 1:20:58| but thank you for letting us know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=4858)|

| 1:21:06| changing the procedures| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=4866)|
| 1:21:08| we have, it might just be easier if you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=4868)|
| 1:21:10| resign because the next person may| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=4870)|
| 1:21:12| want to serve for the duration of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=4872)|
| 1:21:14| their occupancy of their seat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=4874)|

| 1:21:20| I mentioned having a mock| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=4880)|
| 1:21:22| meeting. I don't know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=4882)|
| 1:21:24| if the new members are still| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=4884)|
| 1:21:26| wanting to do that. I know that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=4886)|
| 1:21:28| the first time I sat in this seat| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=4888)|
| 1:21:30| it was so uncomfortable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=4890)|
| 1:21:32| and nerve-wracking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=4892)|
| 1:21:34| I wish I had had just a chance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=4894)|
| 1:21:36| to go through the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=4896)|
| 1:21:38| And we'll take, you know, you can take| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=4898)|
| 1:21:40| an old agenda, something that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=4900)|
| 1:21:42| will not be voting on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=4902)|
| 1:21:44| I think, Mr. Law Director,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=4904)|
| 1:21:46| it would only need to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=4906)|
| 1:21:48| sunshine, public notice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=4908)|
| 1:21:50| It wouldn't have to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=4910)|
| 1:21:52| put in the paper or anything because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=4912)|
| 1:21:54| it's not an actual voting meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=4914)|
| 1:21:56| But I think that would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=4916)|
| 1:21:58| very good for the new members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=4918)|
| 1:22:00| just to get a feel for how the meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=4920)|
| 1:22:02| flow because I know these things feel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=4922)|
| 1:22:04| like they're flying by when you first sit down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=4924)|
| 1:22:06| up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=4926)|

| 1:22:10| opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=4930)|

| 1:22:14| pull that off before the next meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=4934)|
| 1:22:16| Is there any other business to come before this body tonight?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=4936)|
| 1:22:18| Commissioner Bussler?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200901-reorganization?start=4938)|
