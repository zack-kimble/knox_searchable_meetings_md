| 0:01:06| and the senseless violence against other people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=66)|

| 0:01:48| one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=108)|

| 0:02:46| Any opposed? Consent items are approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=166)|
| 0:02:49| For the Mayor's report, first, I thank you, Councilman Wallace, for the moment of silence and the words of your prayer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=169)|
| 0:02:58| I just want to also say a few words about recent events.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=178)|
| 0:03:01| We have all been deeply shaken by the tragedies and deaths in Baton Rouge, in Minnesota, and in Dallas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=181)|
| 0:03:09| We want full investigations and justice to be served for all of the deaths, both of citizens and of police officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=189)|
| 0:03:17| As our thoughts and prayers have gone out to all of those communities, people here and across the country are feeling hurt and angry, sorrowful, and afraid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=197)|
| 0:03:27| In this difficult time, I appreciate the great care and thoughtfulness that we have seen from across our city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=207)|
| 0:03:34| I'm especially grateful for the leadership and professionalism of our police department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=214)|
| 0:03:39| Chief Roush and his officers have a longstanding commitment to community engagement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=219)|
| 0:03:44| and we have seen that repaid in an outpouring of support and sympathy from across Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=224)|
| 0:03:50| And I know the chief and the department deeply appreciates that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=230)|
| 0:03:55| Last Friday, Chief Roush and I attended the four roll calls to thank our KPD officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=235)|
| 0:04:01| I wanted to let them know that we value and appreciate their dedication to protecting and serving our community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=241)|
| 0:04:08| and that we do understand that, and it's been so evident in recent weeks, the personal risk that they take in serving our city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=248)|
| 0:04:18| Our police have been called up to ensure public safety for recent protests and demonstrations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=258)|
| 0:04:24| both protecting the protesters and the general public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=264)|
| 0:04:28| And we have had no serious incidents in any of these events, and people have been able to gather and express themselves peacefully.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=268)|
| 0:04:35| We have reached out to African American pastors and community leaders who are our partners in many ongoing efforts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=275)|
| 0:04:42| to address deep and real issues of equity and opportunity in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=282)|
| 0:04:47| And I appreciate their leadership and our shared commitment to civic engagement and civil dialogue as we wrestle with these difficult issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=287)|
| 0:04:55| Obviously, we can't know what might happen on any given day or night, and anything that happens anywhere can affect us here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=295)|
| 0:05:06| I have to say I am concerned that there is some heightened rhetoric among some small groups against our police officers and this government,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=306)|
| 0:05:14| and there's heightened rhetoric that I have read against the protesters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=314)|
| 0:05:19| Both of those, in my opinion, are irresponsible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=319)|
| 0:05:22| I want to share part of President Obama's statement this week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=322)|
| 0:05:26| He said, we have our divisions and they are not new.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=326)|
| 0:05:29| Around the clock, news cycles and social media sometimes amplify these divisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=329)|
| 0:05:35| And I know we're about to enter a couple of weeks of conventions where our political rhetoric tends to be more overheated than usual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=335)|
| 0:05:43| And that's why it is so important that everyone, regardless of race or political party or profession,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=343)|
| 0:05:49| regardless of what organizations you are part of, that everyone right now focus on words and actions that can unite this country rather than divide it further.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=349)|
| 0:05:58| We don't need inflammatory rhetoric.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=358)|
| 0:06:00| We don't need careless accusations thrown around to score political points or to advance an agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=360)|
| 0:06:06| We need to temper our words and open our hearts, all of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=366)|
| 0:06:10| We need what we saw in Dallas this week as the community came together to restore order and to deepen unity and understanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=370)|
| 0:06:19| We need the kind of efforts we saw this week in meetings between community leaders and police,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=379)|
| 0:06:24| where people of goodwill pledged to work together to reduce violence throughout all of our communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=384)|
| 0:06:30| That's what's needed right now, and it is up to all of us to make sure we are part of the solution and not part of the problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=390)|
| 0:06:37| Those were his words.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=397)|
| 0:06:38| So as leaders here in Knoxville, I believe it's our responsibility to make sure that we continue to be a city that is open and welcoming,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=398)|
| 0:06:46| that values diversity and dialogue, and that engages with our neighbors with good faith and goodwill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=406)|
| 0:06:55| So moving on from that, on a lighter note, we do have a great event coming up tomorrow morning for those of you with young children or grandchildren.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=415)|
| 0:07:05| Daniel Tiger, the star of the hit PBS TV show, Daniel Tiger's Neighborhood, will be appearing at the Lawson-McGee Library downtown tomorrow from 11 a.m. to noon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=425)|
| 0:07:16| This event is sponsored by the city, East Tennessee PBS, Knoxville Area Transit, and the Knox County Public Library.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=436)|
| 0:07:24| Kids can come and get their pictures taken with Daniel at the library.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=444)|
| 0:07:28| Maybe council members can, too. I'm not sure. I'll probably let you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=448)|
| 0:07:32| Daniel will be at 500 West Church Avenue, and then they and their parents or chaperones can take a special storytime ride on one of Kat's downtown trolleys,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=452)|
| 0:07:41| just like Daniel does on TV.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=461)|
| 0:07:43| So all of this is free, and as an added bonus, there will be frozen treats for the kids from Rita's Italian Ice, so let's thank them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=463)|
| 0:07:50| Again, that's at 11 a.m. tomorrow at the downtown library on Church Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=470)|
| 0:07:57| Finally, I want to recognize Mr. Dan Kelly. I am told that this is actually his 39th year anniversary with MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=477)|
| 0:08:07| We appreciate you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=487)|
| 0:08:15| And they keep letting me come back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=495)|
| 0:08:17| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=497)|
| 0:08:19| They keep assigning you to council meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=499)|
| 0:08:24| Are there any council reports?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=504)|
| 0:08:29| Councilman Stair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=509)|
| 0:08:30| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=510)|
| 0:08:31| A couple months ago I went to Atlanta for a walkability conference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=511)|
| 0:08:35| I never gave a report on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=515)|
| 0:08:37| Essentially, there was a lot of workshops on walkability, as you might expect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=517)|
| 0:08:41| But the two things that really impacted me that I wanted to share with you all is, one, it was paid for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=521)|
| 0:08:47| The whole thing was paid for, including my travel expense and hotel, was paid for by the CDC, which I just thought was interesting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=527)|
| 0:08:56| A lot of health advocates are really looking at walkability in the built environment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=536)|
| 0:09:00| and addressing the nation's health crisis, diabetes, obesity, and those issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=540)|
| 0:09:06| So that made a huge impact on me that that's who was funding this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=546)|
| 0:09:12| And the other thing that really impacted me is a lot of the great things that Knoxville is already doing on this front,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=552)|
| 0:09:18| this administration, previous administration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=558)|
| 0:09:21| Just to name a few, the Cumberland Avenue project about making Cumberland Avenue more walkable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=561)|
| 0:09:26| not extending the James White Parkway, some of the road diets on Central Fifth Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=566)|
| 0:09:32| I see we just did one on Church downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=572)|
| 0:09:35| Our form-based codes, some of the really models for the country, the South Waterfront in Cumberland.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=575)|
| 0:09:43| So anyway, it just made me feel really proud.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=583)|
| 0:09:45| And I guess one reason I'm bringing it up tonight, one of the presenters at the conference is coming to Knoxville next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=585)|
| 0:09:52| His name is Ian Lockwood. He's with Tool Design.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=592)|
| 0:09:55| And they've made some of the most unwalkable areas in the country walkable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=595)|
| 0:10:02| He's really an expert on it, and I thought his presentations were very interesting at the event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=602)|
| 0:10:10| But anyway, I just wanted to mark your calendar for those two days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=610)|
| 0:10:13| The events I know of on July 27th, I think he's going to speak to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=613)|
| 0:10:21| he's going to speak at the planning organization meeting, which I believe starts at 9.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=621)|
| 0:10:26| I think he's speaking at 9.45.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=626)|
| 0:10:28| And that night at the health department, the doors open at 5.30, and I think he's going to be on at 6.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=628)|
| 0:10:35| And there's going to be an event, a social afterwards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=635)|
| 0:10:37| We'll be able to talk to him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=637)|
| 0:10:38| And I think there's some events they're working on for July 28th, so look out for those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=638)|
| 0:10:44| But anyway, I just wanted to share that with you, and please mark your calendar for Ian coming to town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=644)|
| 0:10:52| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=652)|
| 0:10:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=654)|
| 0:10:55| Councilman Del Valle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=655)|
| 0:10:56| Yes, thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=656)|
| 0:10:57| I just want to thank the people in the northeast quadrant of this city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=657)|
| 0:11:01| We've been running a Survey Monkey survey about retail and business service in that area that goes from Broadway all the way east to the Holston River.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=661)|
| 0:11:14| And I think we've had 313 or 315 responses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=674)|
| 0:11:19| The information is being compiled now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=679)|
| 0:11:21| But we felt like the neighborhood groups that were involved in my district, the 4th District, as well as the 4th and the 5th District, contributed to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=681)|
| 0:11:30| And I appreciate folks taking the time to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=690)|
| 0:11:33| Those results will help us as we work our way towards a fall economic summit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=693)|
| 0:11:38| And once again, it's all about the folks in the districts, not about us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=698)|
| 0:11:42| And so we hope to bring businessmen together with residents and see if we don't have common interests that can better develop this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=702)|
| 0:11:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=712)|
| 0:11:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=713)|
| 0:11:56| Anybody else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=716)|
| 0:11:59| Okay, we'll go to elections and confirmations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=719)|
| 0:12:02| 8A is the resolution to confirm nominations for members and officers for the Mayor's Council on Disability Issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=722)|
| 0:12:09| Move for approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=729)|
| 0:12:10| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=730)|
| 0:12:11| I believe we have with us three of the four new appointees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=731)|
| 0:12:16| Where are they?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=736)|
| 0:12:17| Would you please stand?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=737)|

| 0:14:17| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=857)|
| 0:14:18| Council, we have three people signed up to speak on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=858)|
| 0:14:23| Mr. Jed Dance, Mr. Arthur Seymour, and Mr. John King.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=863)|
| 0:14:28| Would you all like to come down?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=868)|
| 0:14:29| Hello, Mr. Dance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=869)|
| 0:14:31| As you know, please state your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=871)|
| 0:14:33| And you have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=873)|
| 0:14:35| Thank you for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=875)|
| 0:14:38| Jed Dance, 206 West Summit Hill Drive, Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=878)|
| 0:14:45| As you all are aware, the Dance family would not like for this H1 overlay to move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=885)|
| 0:14:53| We've been in business since 1925 downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=893)|
| 0:14:57| We've been there when nobody was there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=897)|
| 0:14:59| We've saved the building twice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=899)|
| 0:15:01| And I've gone through a lot of that the other time, so I'm not going to go through a lot of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=901)|
| 0:15:05| But since December when we had the last meeting, a lot has changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=905)|
| 0:15:10| And as Bill said, the last council, obviously the time is right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=910)|
| 0:15:14| There's been a lot of factors that have made the time right, with the Marble Alley loss opening,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=914)|
| 0:15:23| with the State Street being two ways, and then also with my father's estate being settled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=923)|
| 0:15:32| We were able to move ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=932)|
| 0:15:34| Since that meeting, they told us to get going, and we've hired an architect,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=934)|
| 0:15:40| and we've hired a construction company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=940)|
| 0:15:43| So we were kind of doing what we told them we would do, and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=943)|
| 0:15:51| We understand where we are now tonight, and so we're planning to continue our process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=951)|
| 0:16:00| We have a meeting, I guess, with the downtown review board tomorrow is when our plans come across there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=960)|
| 0:16:07| So hopefully we would get some assistance from you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=967)|
| 0:16:12| We said you all would do that, and so we're doing what we're trying to do to fix this building up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=972)|
| 0:16:19| We realized that it's pretty clear, I hope you know, that it's the Dance family's wish to save this Johnson building through all these years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=979)|
| 0:16:40| And so we're going to continue with that, and we have no plans of ever tearing it down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=1000)|
| 0:16:47| So I just wanted that to be on the record here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=1007)|
| 0:16:53| And we'd also, once we get started, we'd like to work with the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=1013)|
| 0:16:56| and however we can honor Cal, whether it's a plaque on there or whatever that looks like, to save his heritage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=1016)|
| 0:17:03| But we would love to see if this could be postponed so that we can finish with all our construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=1023)|
| 0:17:10| Y'all said that we would fall under the downtown review board, and then that way, you know, I don't guess there'd be ever an issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=1030)|
| 0:17:16| and then that way it wouldn't be able to be torn down if the H-1 gets put on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=1036)|
| 0:17:20| So with that, any questions? Or that's really about all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=1040)|
| 0:17:28| Councilman Dallavope?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=1048)|
| 0:17:29| Yeah, if I could have just one question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=1049)|
| 0:17:31| I appreciate what the Dance family has done in trying to preserve this building and trying to put it back into productive use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=1051)|
| 0:17:38| and I guess we've aired a lot of the issues in this the last time we were before council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=1058)|
| 0:17:43| and I guess we're going to go back there again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=1063)|
| 0:17:45| One of the things I saw in the MPC record was that you were seeking permission to remove the back portion of the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=1065)|
| 0:17:52| In order to make that more usable, you would close it up as you open up windows and whatnot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=1072)|
| 0:17:57| Have you met any opposition about that aspect?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=1077)|
| 0:18:01| I mean, the front facade and the streetscape is visible from State Street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=1081)|
| 0:18:06| and this is in the back area by the alley, but I'm just curious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=1086)|
| 0:18:09| Yeah, when we originally started meeting, we need parking and we need to be able to get trucks in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=1089)|
| 0:18:15| You know, we've run that business forever, and now as it gets crowded and crowded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=1095)|
| 0:18:19| So when we met with Bill and his team to show them the plans, they'd originally said you can take part of it off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=1099)|
| 0:18:27| We couldn't take off as much as they had wanted us to, and so it does not make economic sense right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=1107)|
| 0:18:35| unless the contractors say something different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=1115)|
| 0:18:38| It doesn't make economic sense to take any of it off because we only pick up two or four parking spaces,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=1118)|
| 0:18:44| and so for the money, that wasn't really viable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=1124)|
| 0:18:48| So right now we're-| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=1128)|
| 0:18:49| So your current plans are to keep the same footprint as it is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=1129)|
| 0:18:52| Yeah, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=1132)|
| 0:18:53| Okay, well thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=1133)|
| 0:18:54| Because of the percentage that we're allowed to take off the back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=1134)|
| 0:18:59| You can't substantially improve the size of the parking area, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=1139)|
| 0:19:04| Fair statement, Bill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=1144)|
| 0:19:05| I mean, we just can't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=1145)|
| 0:19:06| You know, we would only get four parking spots, and for the money, it's not worth it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=1146)|
| 0:19:10| You might as well rent one next door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=1150)|
| 0:19:11| Yeah, so we've been trying to work with KUB and the Promenade Parking to acquire parking to go along.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=1151)|
| 0:19:19| As we developed this building, we felt like we've got to provide parking to tenants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=1159)|
| 0:19:24| So that was our motive there, really, was to pick up parking for our own employees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=1164)|
| 0:19:29| because we've grown through the years, and we have over 30-some-odd employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=1169)|
| 0:19:33| We're a small little business that's hung in here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=1173)|
| 0:19:36| We're not a big public company that has unlimited funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=1176)|
| 0:19:40| We have to work hard, and so we have to watch our pennies as we go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=1180)|
| 0:19:45| Well, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=1185)|
| 0:19:46| Again, I appreciate what you and your family has done to try to preserve this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=1186)|
| 0:19:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=1191)|
| 0:19:52| Councilman Wallace?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=1192)|
| 0:19:53| Yeah, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=1193)|
| 0:19:54| Thank you, Jed, for coming out tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=1194)|
| 0:19:56| And what I hear out of that is your acknowledgment and acceptance that the H-1 will be placed on the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=1196)|
| 0:20:05| There wasn't much room to work around that last time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=1205)|
| 0:20:12| So, I mean, are you agreeable to that tonight?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=1212)|
| 0:20:14| Can you say, I'm agreeable to that tonight, and we can have a unanimous vote to put the H-1 and move forward?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=1214)|
| 0:20:19| Are you agreeable to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=1219)|
| 0:20:20| You're moving forward with your construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=1220)|
| 0:20:23| I know what you're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=1223)|
| 0:20:26| I believe in you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=1226)|
| 0:20:27| I believed in you all along, and I believe that you would do the right thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=1227)|
| 0:20:30| But can we agree to that tonight?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=1230)|
| 0:20:34| Well, for us, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=1234)|
| 0:20:35| We don't want the H-1, and I'm not going to agree to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=1235)|
| 0:20:38| We're trying to be good citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=1238)|
| 0:20:40| I mean, we've always done what we said, so no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=1240)|
| 0:20:42| We still don't want the H-1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=1242)|
| 0:20:45| We don't think it's necessary because we are committing to fixing this up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=1245)|
| 0:20:50| It's like I've told probably all of you, if we spend this kind of money, we're not going to tear it down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=1250)|
| 0:20:54| and, you know, we don't plan on selling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=1254)|
| 0:20:56| We're trying to grow our business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=1256)|
| 0:20:58| So, unfortunately, no, but, you know, yeah, we didn't want to start without the H-1,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=1258)|
| 0:21:03| but we're trying to be good citizens and, you know, move forward and work however we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=1263)|
| 0:21:09| So, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=1269)|
| 0:21:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=1270)|
| 0:21:11| Because we've been kind of disappointed in the whole process, how it kind of unfolded really.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=1271)|
| 0:21:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=1275)|
| 0:21:16| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=1276)|
| 0:21:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=1277)|
| 0:21:18| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=1278)|
| 0:21:19| We've got two more speakers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=1279)|
| 0:21:21| Are they going to speak or not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=1281)|
| 0:21:23| Pardon me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=1283)|
| 0:21:25| Are you speaking, Mr. Seymour?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=1285)|
| 0:21:27| Mayor, I think Mr. King and I would simply rely on the statements we made last week or two weeks ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=1287)|
| 0:21:33| Two weeks ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=1293)|
| 0:21:34| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=1294)|
| 0:21:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=1295)|
| 0:21:36| Any other discussion from council?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=1296)|
| 0:21:39| We have a motion and a second to approve the rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=1299)|
| 0:21:42| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=1302)|
| 0:21:44| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=1304)|
| 0:21:45| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=1305)|
| 0:21:46| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=1306)|
| 0:21:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=1307)|
| 0:21:48| Two and one pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=1308)|
| 0:21:49| So this passes six to two to one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=1309)|
| 0:21:53| One abstention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=1313)|
| 0:21:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=1316)|
| 0:21:58| Now we move on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=1318)|
| 0:22:00| 9D is an ordinance to amend the Knoxville City Code Appendix B zoning regulations to define alternative financial services,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=1320)|
| 0:22:06| identify zoning districts in which they are permitted, and establish standards for their location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=1326)|
| 0:22:12| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=1332)|
| 0:22:13| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=1333)|
| 0:22:14| We have two people that are signed up to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=1334)|
| 0:22:17| Jim Brady and Terry Carruthers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=1337)|
| 0:22:20| Do you wish to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=1340)|
| 0:22:22| Ms. Carruthers, please state your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=1342)|
| 0:22:25| You have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=1345)|
| 0:22:26| Thanks for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=1346)|
| 0:22:28| Terry Carruthers, 6102 Arcadia Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=1348)|
| 0:22:33| Other cities in the state of Tennessee and across the United States have passed these ordinances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=1353)|
| 0:22:39| that have put limitations on the location of these alternative financial institutions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=1359)|
| 0:22:47| And if a city in Tennessee as small as Sperna can be brave enough to do this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=1367)|
| 0:22:52| I think it's time that Knoxville stepped forward since we are one of the larger cities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=1372)|
| 0:22:57| And if something is not done, if we continue to wait for the state to act,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=1377)|
| 0:23:01| then all of our main thoroughfares are just going to be taken up with all of these alternative financial institutions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=1381)|
| 0:23:08| and there's not going to be room for other businesses to come in that can make our communities better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=1388)|
| 0:23:13| And so I would urge you to vote as you did at your last meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=1393)|
| 0:23:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=1399)|
| 0:23:20| Thank you, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=1400)|
| 0:23:21| Mr. Brady.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=1401)|
| 0:23:24| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=1404)|
| 0:23:25| Thank you for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=1405)|
| 0:23:27| Thank you, Mayor, members of the Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=1407)|
| 0:23:29| Mr. Pavlis, thank you again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=1409)|
| 0:23:30| And address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=1410)|
| 0:23:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=1411)|
| 0:23:32| Jim Brady, 208 Linford Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=1412)|
| 0:23:36| I just wanted to reiterate the things we've discussed here because this is an important issue to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=1416)|
| 0:23:41| This is our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=1421)|
| 0:23:42| This is actually the image that we carry when we have visitors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=1422)|
| 0:23:46| This is the image we carry within our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=1426)|
| 0:23:49| These are the things that matter to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=1429)|
| 0:23:51| This is where we live.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=1431)|
| 0:23:54| As we've gone through this over and over again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=1434)|
| 0:23:56| we see these recurring themes of reaching out for the least common denominator.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=1436)|
| 0:24:00| When you look at the historically, you know, what used to be old pager sales companies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=1440)|
| 0:24:05| you'd see four, five, six of these being sold in grocers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=1445)|
| 0:24:08| and you realize that wasn't someplace you really wanted to break down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=1448)|
| 0:24:12| We've compared this to the clustering or the zoning issues regarding adult bookstores, adult video, liquor sales.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=1452)|
| 0:24:21| There's a theme that seems to be coming out of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=1461)|
| 0:24:24| There's a reason there's apprehension with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=1464)|
| 0:24:27| Right now our state legislature and the federal government are both actively pursuing proper legislation for this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=1467)|
| 0:24:34| because this is an issue that is across our country, not just here in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=1474)|
| 0:24:38| And with that being said, we need to be ahead of the curve on this, not behind it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=1478)|
| 0:24:44| I took to heart actually what Councilman Wallace said last session,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=1484)|
| 0:24:49| and I went through that and I thought about the idea of the fact that he was the sole discerning voice on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=1489)|
| 0:24:54| And I had to start thinking about the idea of what was the best for our community in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=1494)|
| 0:25:00| Eight of the nine folks voted for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=1500)|
| 0:25:03| And when we start looking at the greater need of the citizens, the more good it does,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=1503)|
| 0:25:14| the greater good for the greater amount of people tends to be a really good barometer for what is right and what is wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=1514)|
| 0:25:22| And this is important, and it says this is the corridor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=1522)|
| 0:25:27| Every aspect of where people come to and from our community come through these corridors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=1527)|
| 0:25:32| whether it be down Chapman Highway going into the Smoky Mountains,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=1532)|
| 0:25:35| whether it be going up 275 heading into Kentucky or going east and west.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=1535)|
| 0:25:39| Those are the places where all of these businesses tend to cluster and want to be because it's a long thoroughfare.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=1539)|
| 0:25:47| So we've realized great production and presentation by the MPC on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=1547)|
| 0:25:55| It's not a socioeconomic issue for the lower income.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=1555)|
| 0:25:58| We saw that definitively.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=1558)|
| 0:26:00| And this really is how we look to the people as they come and visit us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=1560)|
| 0:26:05| So I'd like to turn the same exact questionnaire that you had just before with Mr. Dance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=1565)|
| 0:26:09| I'd like you to think about the idea of being a part of the anatomy of this, being a part of everyone else's decision on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=1569)|
| 0:26:17| because this is who we are as a community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=1577)|
| 0:26:19| And I'd like to see us all move forward, that when the state and the federal government finally does catch up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=1579)|
| 0:26:25| I'd like us to be ahead of that and be leading it, not following behind it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=1585)|
| 0:26:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=1590)|
| 0:26:33| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=1593)|
| 0:26:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=1596)|
| 0:26:37| So is there we have a motion in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=1597)|
| 0:26:40| Councilman Del Valle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=1600)|
| 0:26:41| Yeah, I just want to thank the speakers for talking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=1601)|
| 0:26:43| But I think the crux of this matter is that it is the clustering that brings the negative air to an area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=1603)|
| 0:26:53| And we're not attempting to regulate anything that happens inside the four walls of these businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=1613)|
| 0:26:59| That's the business of the federal government and the state government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=1619)|
| 0:27:02| We're just saying you need to be further apart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=1622)|
| 0:27:06| You need to not bring sort of a negative pall on a community that inhibits its healthy growth and its revitalization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=1626)|
| 0:27:15| And I think this bill helps us do that, and I'm going to support it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=1635)|
| 0:27:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=1639)|
| 0:27:20| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=1640)|
| 0:27:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=1641)|
| 0:27:22| Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=1642)|
| 0:27:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=1643)|
| 0:27:24| And I don't want to belabor the point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=1644)|
| 0:27:26| And I agree with that, and I appreciate you saying that, Jim.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=1646)|
| 0:27:33| And I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=1653)|
| 0:27:35| It's one of those things I'm just not quite sure that it's going to have the intended belief or intended consequence on those businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=1655)|
| 0:27:44| I think there are situations, as brought out last time, in the same shopping center where they're a few hundred feet apart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=1664)|
| 0:27:53| You know, that was a landlord decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=1673)|
| 0:27:55| That necessarily wasn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=1675)|
| 0:27:57| That was a landlord deciding who to rent their property to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=1677)|
| 0:28:01| I have certainly no way of supporting these businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=1681)|
| 0:28:04| And because you asked, I will change my vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=1684)|
| 0:28:07| I'll make it unanimous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=1687)|
| 0:28:08| You asked for that, and I'll do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=1688)|
| 0:28:15| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=1695)|
| 0:28:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=1696)|
| 0:28:17| So we have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=1697)|
| 0:28:19| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=1699)|
| 0:28:20| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=1700)|
| 0:28:21| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=1701)|
| 0:28:22| The motion passes unanimously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=1702)|
| 0:28:25| 9E is an ordinance to rezone property located on the southeast side of Homburg Drive, southwest of South Mohegan Street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=1705)|
| 0:28:31| from I-2 to C-3 District, People's Development Company, Inc., Applicant 2nd District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=1711)|
| 0:28:38| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=1718)|
| 0:28:39| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=1719)|
| 0:28:40| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=1720)|
| 0:28:41| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=1721)|
| 0:28:42| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=1722)|
| 0:28:43| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=1723)|
| 0:28:44| The ayes have it, and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=1724)|
| 0:28:47| 9F is an ordinance to adopt the one-year plan dated 2016,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=1727)|
| 0:28:51| as prepared by the Metropolitan Planning Commission for the City of Knoxville, all districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=1731)|
| 0:28:56| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=1736)|
| 0:28:57| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=1737)|
| 0:28:58| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=1738)|
| 0:29:00| Pardon me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=1740)|
| 0:29:01| Is Lynn Redman here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=1741)|
| 0:29:03| Nobody signed up to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=1743)|
| 0:29:06| Mr. Redman here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=1746)|
| 0:29:07| I understand they have done what they said they would do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=1747)|
| 0:29:09| MPC has sent the information out, correct, on the properties?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=1749)|
| 0:29:13| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=1753)|
| 0:29:15| Everybody's happy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=1755)|
| 0:29:16| Councilwoman Palmer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=1756)|
| 0:29:18| A few minutes ago, and he said that he's good with this and to vote for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=1758)|
| 0:29:24| He supports it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=1764)|
| 0:29:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=1766)|
| 0:29:27| So, again, we have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=1767)|
| 0:29:29| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=1769)|
| 0:29:30| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=1770)|
| 0:29:31| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=1771)|
| 0:29:32| The ayes have it, and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=1772)|
| 0:29:33| Mayor, if I could ask one question of MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=1773)|
| 0:29:37| Is this in place one year from today, or is this like a nine-month plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=1777)|
| 0:29:41| Where are we in terms of when you renew this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=1781)|
| 0:29:44| I just don't, since we've postponed it so long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=1784)|
| 0:29:47| I believe we've got a nine-month plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=1787)|
| 0:29:49| The charter requires it come up in April.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=1789)|
| 0:29:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=1792)|
| 0:29:53| So next April we'll be facing another.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=1793)|
| 0:29:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=1795)|
| 0:29:56| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=1796)|
| 0:29:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=1797)|
| 0:29:58| Ten A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=1798)|
| 0:29:59| Earrings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=1799)|
| 0:30:00| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=1800)|
| 0:30:01| Ten A is an ordinance approving the request of Quentin Bourgeois for a one-year planned amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=1801)|
| 0:30:06| from low-density residential to medium-density residential for property located on the west side of Bruin Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=1806)|
| 0:30:12| north of Dutch Valley Drive, on appeal from a decision of the Metropolitan Planning Commission, 5th District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=1812)|
| 0:30:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=1819)|
| 0:30:20| So this is an appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=1820)|
| 0:30:22| So we have a little bit of a different process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=1822)|
| 0:30:24| We'll start with the appellant, which is Mr. Bourgeois.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=1824)|
| 0:30:31| And, sir, you and up to two other people can speak for up to five minutes each.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=1831)|
| 0:30:37| And then we do have one person who's signed up to speak against it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=1837)|
| 0:30:43| So she will get five minutes to speak, and then you have up to a two-minute rebuttal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=1843)|
| 0:30:47| Mayor, before you start, I am going to recuse myself from this, as I did last time this came up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=1847)|
| 0:30:53| because my son worked with Mr. Bourgeois.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=1853)|
| 0:30:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=1855)|
| 0:30:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=1856)|
| 0:30:57| Just a preliminary question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=1857)|
| 0:30:59| We acted on this, what, five or six months ago, or was that just sent back to MPC?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=1859)|
| 0:31:03| I don't know how we got here procedurally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=1863)|
| 0:31:06| Well, I think Mr. Bourgeois, his request was denied last time, and I believe he's entitled to bring it up once a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=1866)|
| 0:31:15| So it's like a reconsideration of the request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=1875)|
| 0:31:17| No, it's not a reconsideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=1877)|
| 0:31:18| We just have him going through the process again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=1878)|
| 0:31:22| He's starting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=1882)|
| 0:31:23| He started the clock again, I see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=1883)|
| 0:31:24| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=1884)|
| 0:31:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=1885)|
| 0:31:26| I didn't know how we got here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=1886)|
| 0:31:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=1888)|
| 0:31:29| Sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=1889)|
| 0:31:30| I would like to point out on that point there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=1890)|
| 0:31:32| Name and address for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=1892)|
| 0:31:34| It's Quentin Bourgeois, 8812 Tedford Road, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37922.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=1894)|
| 0:31:40| The last time I was in front of you, we actually didn't do a vote either, so how you look at denial or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=1900)|
| 0:31:45| but it was interesting to me that we went through the process and there was actually never a motion made,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=1905)|
| 0:31:49| so there was not a vote made either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=1909)|
| 0:31:51| I would at least like a vote this time, win, lose, or draw.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=1911)|
| 0:31:54| Please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=1914)|
| 0:31:57| I'm usually pretty good in one-on-one, but not as good in crowds, so I'll put this in letter form.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=1917)|
| 0:32:01| If you'll let me struggle through my letter here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=1921)|
| 0:32:04| Before you again regarding the taking of my property rights in the form of rezoning, I didn't request or have any involvement in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=1924)|
| 0:32:11| I went back to the original passing of the ordinance that allowed this to occur.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=1931)|
| 0:32:15| I found it to be fairly contentious, passing by an eight to seven margin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=1935)|
| 0:32:18| It could be argued that it may have not even gone to vote had it not been for the strong insistence at the time of the chairperson,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=1938)|
| 0:32:26| as there was at least one commissioner that didn't want to vote on it, feeling it was not an appropriate motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=1946)|
| 0:32:32| I want to read you some of the statements that were made at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=1952)|
| 0:32:36| Art Clancy said, nobody wants their property downzoned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=1956)|
| 0:32:39| If somebody's not here, it's hard to imagine changing their zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=1959)|
| 0:32:43| If they didn't walk here and say, downzone my property, it's hard to do administratively.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=1963)|
| 0:32:48| Laura Cole said, I understand why people want to keep their zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=1968)|
| 0:32:52| Wes Stowers said, it's a taking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=1972)|
| 0:32:55| A commissioner I couldn't identify on the video said, I'm struggling with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=1975)|
| 0:32:58| There are people out there that aren't going to be happy with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=1978)|
| 0:33:02| You can see why I was surprised when, upon hearing that it had happened to my property without my knowledge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=1982)|
| 0:33:06| that I was so quickly discounted by some, not all, about ever having received notice,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=1986)|
| 0:33:12| which I would point out, had I received notice, I would have zero motivation for being aware of such| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=1992)|
| 0:33:17| and not acting to defend my rights as others did so easily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=1997)|
| 0:33:20| On the other hand, it does appear through the city's actions and statements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=2000)|
| 0:33:24| that there is quite a bit of motivation for my property to be rezoned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=2004)|
| 0:33:27| Just like the old statement, follow the money, in this case one should follow the motivation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=2007)|
| 0:33:33| At the very least, the whole process has been anything but transparent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=2013)|
| 0:33:36| especially considering my chief opponent is an employee of MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=2016)|
| 0:33:40| And while I would like to think nothing sinister has occurred, government should always be transparent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=2020)|
| 0:33:44| which again, this has been anything but.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=2024)|
| 0:33:47| Simply put, a notice sent regular mail for something of such importance just seems ludicrous to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=2027)|
| 0:33:53| The thing that appears to push to me even the legality of the city's action| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=2033)|
| 0:33:57| is the narrow scope that has been created to control one's property in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=2037)|
| 0:34:01| Had my fee-simple ownership been taken, I would have to have been paid for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=2041)|
| 0:34:06| Had I ever simply so much as gotten a permit to cut initial road into the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=2046)|
| 0:34:11| then my zoning could not have been taken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=2051)|
| 0:34:14| But the city has given themselves a narrow parameter that allows the control of a piece of property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=2054)|
| 0:34:18| without it costing a penny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=2058)|
| 0:34:20| Keep in mind, this is property the city has no use for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=2060)|
| 0:34:23| but is insistent on what my use should be for the appeasement of a few.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=2063)|
| 0:34:28| It would seem to me that if the city or the neighborhood itself is so interested in the use of this property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=2068)|
| 0:34:34| that either one could have purchased it when it was on the open market as I did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=2074)|
| 0:34:38| Don't let me buy and invest for 12 plus years and then step in and mold it to your desires to my detriment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=2078)|
| 0:34:44| The value has been affected somewhere in the $200,000 to $250,000 range.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=2084)|
| 0:34:49| As my wife pointed out to me, it would take her three years of working to make up what the city has done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=2089)|
| 0:34:54| with the supposedly carved, mailed out regular mail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=2094)|
| 0:34:57| That's one heck of a civil penalty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=2097)|
| 0:34:59| There are people that commit fairly major crimes that are not penalized nearly so severe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=2099)|
| 0:35:04| I truly would have been better off had someone broken into my home rather than this rezoning take place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=2104)|
| 0:35:09| There wouldn't have been nearly as much that could be taken in value as what my family and I have lost here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=2109)|
| 0:35:13| This is real money, real value taken from someone's family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=2113)|
| 0:35:17| But I have to ask, why is it so important to change anyway?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=2117)|
| 0:35:20| The only real difference being changed is the density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=2120)|
| 0:35:23| And let's be honest, density often equates to income.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=2123)|
| 0:35:26| So I hear the city talk all the time about the need for affordable housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=2126)|
| 0:35:30| I see my property, on the other hand, being taken away at my expense,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=2130)|
| 0:35:34| with the net result being that affordable housing can't be located on a track of land| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=2134)|
| 0:35:38| that backs up to existing apartments off a major intersection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=2138)|
| 0:35:42| and only one lot removed from a commercial zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=2142)|
| 0:35:44| You have one minute, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=2144)|
| 0:35:47| I'm also left to wonder how many people really wanted my property changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=2147)|
| 0:35:50| I did some research on what other states allow and learned that there are some states,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=2150)|
| 0:35:54| mainly in the northeast, that do have a format to change zonings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=2154)|
| 0:35:57| when a certain percent of that voting block votes on such,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=2157)|
| 0:36:00| usually between 25 and 40 percent of the total population.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=2160)|
| 0:36:04| While I completely disagree with this notion of the majority of the people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=2164)|
| 0:36:07| being able to implement their will in the minority, at least in that scenario,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=2167)|
| 0:36:10| there is a set amount of people that have to be after your property zoning to make the change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=2170)|
| 0:36:14| In my case, it is not clear how many people oppose me anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=2174)|
| 0:36:18| I can tell you I met with the concerned homeowners group last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=2178)|
| 0:36:21| Four people showed up, one of which was MPC's own Mary Jo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=2181)|
| 0:36:25| At the last meeting, there were about a dozen people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=2185)|
| 0:36:27| At the most recent MPC meeting, there were about eight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=2187)|
| 0:36:30| Hardly the outcry you see in contentious zoning debates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=2190)|
| 0:36:34| I will tell you who is not here to support me tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=2194)|
| 0:36:36| It is not any of the 80 families that could have potentially lived there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=2196)|
| 0:36:38| Sir, you need to conclude.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=2198)|
| 0:36:41| I've got two pages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=2201)|
| 0:36:43| Anyway, I've got a way to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=2203)|
| 0:36:44| If I can finish this last statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=2204)|
| 0:36:46| I will tell you who is not here to support me tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=2206)|
| 0:36:48| It is any of the 80 families that could have potentially lived on this track if developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=2208)|
| 0:36:52| They will never at this point even know there was a place they could have chosen to live and call home| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=2212)|
| 0:36:56| because if allowed to stand, of course, that will never happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=2216)|
| 0:37:01| If I can finish one more paragraph, then my attorney will finish reading this, if that's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=2221)|
| 0:37:04| But I'd like to read this one myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=2224)|
| 0:37:07| Well, we have a set process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=2227)|
| 0:37:09| Since this is an administrative hearing, we really need to follow through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=2229)|
| 0:37:12| So if the next person would like to come up and finish that, then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=2232)|
| 0:37:16| Sorry, we have to follow the rules here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=2236)|
| 0:37:26| Sir, if you'd please state your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=2246)|
| 0:37:28| Scott McCulley, 1980 Jackson Road, Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=2248)|
| 0:37:34| As Mr. Bourgeois said, I'm his attorney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=2254)|
| 0:37:37| Honestly, I'm here probably more as his friend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=2257)|
| 0:37:41| And I would like to continue this letter and then make a few comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=2261)|
| 0:37:47| The letter continues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=2267)|
| 0:37:49| I have heard council members say that they want to support the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=2269)|
| 0:37:52| and whatever the community wants is what they will do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=2272)|
| 0:37:55| While this sounds good, I would question if four or five people support one thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=2275)|
| 0:37:59| and say 20 or 25 support something else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=2279)|
| 0:38:03| Just ask yourself, does that mean just because 25 is more than five that the majority wins| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=2283)|
| 0:38:09| and would win to the point that you would strip a landowner who's been invested over a decade| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=2289)|
| 0:38:13| in the property to appease the majority?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=2293)|
| 0:38:16| If you give my property back now, it will still have cost me thousands of dollars,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=2296)|
| 0:38:20| tremendous amounts of time, and untold anguish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=2300)|
| 0:38:24| If you don't, what are you saying about the property rights in the city of Knoxville?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=2304)|
| 0:38:29| If this is allowed to stand, it will be my biggest real estate loss by far in 30 years of real estate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=2309)|
| 0:38:35| And why?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=2315)|
| 0:38:36| Because I invested in property in a city that would, unbeknownst to me, strip me of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=2316)|
| 0:38:42| What are you going to tell out-of-state owners or retired people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=2322)|
| 0:38:45| that may spend some of their time out of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=2325)|
| 0:38:48| or anybody that doesn't go by their property on a regular basis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=2328)|
| 0:38:52| or subscribe to the Knoxville News Sentinel that they better watch for notices| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=2332)|
| 0:38:57| or they could lose their property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=2337)|
| 0:38:59| lose it in the exact way some of the commissioners that I first quoted were concerned about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=2339)|
| 0:39:06| At the last Young PC meeting, there was a property where a 78-year-old had received a notice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=2346)|
| 0:39:11| while tending to her terminally ill husband and lost zoning for not leaving his side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=2351)|
| 0:39:17| This, as many of you know, has called the attention of some state legislatures,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=2357)|
| 0:39:21| and this particular case was even cited as an example of government overstepping their boundaries| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=2361)|
| 0:39:27| and a bill is going to be proposed so this possibly can't happen in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=2367)|
| 0:39:32| It's known as a regulatory taking, and I, along with others,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=2372)|
| 0:39:36| don't think it is something our forefathers ever envisioned or intended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=2376)|
| 0:39:41| I do think it is worth making note of why I feel Young PC recommended non-approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=2381)|
| 0:39:46| My old zoning did not call for use on review, which was one reason I purchased it to start with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=2386)|
| 0:39:52| Had I developed this property, I would have had to meet a strict list of guidelines| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=2392)|
| 0:39:56| and could have proceeded. Use on review gives Young PC full control| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=2396)|
| 0:40:01| to tweak how they view fit even outside the zoning guidelines that one might meet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=2401)|
| 0:40:06| So in a nutshell, they now have control they didn't previously have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=2406)|
| 0:40:10| I think you will find it's been very rare in history when a government agency is asked,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=2410)|
| 0:40:14| do you want more or less control, for them to choose less.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=2414)|
| 0:40:19| So it seems obvious to me, of course, they're going to recommend denial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=2419)|
| 0:40:24| Just briefly, what strikes me in this case is, as Mr. Bourgeois said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=2424)|
| 0:40:31| he purchased this property a great deal because of the zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=2431)|
| 0:40:36| and now for it to be stripped of that in a process that really,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=2436)|
| 0:40:43| there's not much due process, is concerning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=2443)|
| 0:40:49| Particularly where, and maybe someone could explain to us, how this helps the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=2449)|
| 0:40:55| All I can see is it hurts Mr. Bourgeois a great deal, and I don't see the benefits of the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=2455)|
| 0:41:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=2461)|
| 0:41:02| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=2462)|
| 0:41:05| And now for the respondent is Betty Jo Mahan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=2465)|
| 0:41:19| Please state your name and address for the record, and you have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=2479)|
| 0:41:24| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=2484)|
| 0:41:25| Betty Jo Mahan, 5325 Rowan Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=2485)|
| 0:41:30| And I, too, am going to read because that's still easier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=2490)|
| 0:41:33| Go right ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=2493)|
| 0:41:35| This appeal is being sold as Mr. Bourgeois not being treated fairly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=2495)|
| 0:41:39| He's even stated that I'm his biggest opponent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=2499)|
| 0:41:42| I'm not opposed to him personally, as I'm sure you all are not either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=2502)|
| 0:41:46| He's a business man.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=2506)|
| 0:41:48| This is about a community which has not been treated fairly and overlooked for many years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=2508)|
| 0:41:53| I remember the first time when I saw the NSKIP small area plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=2513)|
| 0:41:57| and the map showed that R2 were all around the triangular boundaries of NSKIP,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=2517)|
| 0:42:02| which is where the general rezoning was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=2522)|
| 0:42:04| And those were all R1 and R1A in lower density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=2524)|
| 0:42:08| You could tell the area was overlooked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=2528)|
| 0:42:10| Over the years, the small and large multifamily developments inundated NSKIP| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=2530)|
| 0:42:15| until we're saturated with minimal changes in infrastructure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=2535)|
| 0:42:20| Your wise decision to rezone the NSKIP area to a lower density| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=2540)|
| 0:42:25| was to protect the fragile state of our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=2545)|
| 0:42:30| We showed you last year with the petitions that the community is asking for relief| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=2550)|
| 0:42:35| from so much overcrowding and unplanned growth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=2555)|
| 0:42:41| I'm not sure if you all are familiar with this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=2561)|
| 0:42:43| but the report of the Tennessee Advisory Committee on Intergovernmental Relations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=2563)|
| 0:42:47| where Senator Nicely was starting to initiate a bill about all rezoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=2567)|
| 0:42:52| had to be signed off on property owners, but it made several interesting statements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=2572)|
| 0:42:58| Requiring owner consent for rezonings would disrupt the dispute resolution process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=2578)|
| 0:43:05| embodied by zoning laws and local government structure created to support it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=2585)|
| 0:43:12| Giving individual property owners veto power over rezonings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=2592)|
| 0:43:17| would impede zoning efforts on community consent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=2597)|
| 0:43:23| expressed to local elective legislative bodies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=2603)|
| 0:43:27| and could create problems for neighborhoods by allowing incompatible land uses next to each other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=2607)|
| 0:43:34| But the real support for zoning was that it provided an effective way for entire communities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=2614)|
| 0:43:41| to protect the character and the quality of life in their neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=2621)|
| 0:43:46| Requiring owner consent for rezonings could make land use plans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=2626)|
| 0:43:52| based on input from citizens, developers, and others irrelevant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=2632)|
| 0:43:57| That was directly from the report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=2637)|
| 0:44:00| Knoxville is now growing in a more planned growth because of you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=2640)|
| 0:44:04| We're asking you to vote no on this appeal item 9A and B.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=2644)|
| 0:44:09| Voting no does not take away anyone's property rights,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=2649)|
| 0:44:12| but protects the rights of the voters that you all represent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=2652)|
| 0:44:16| We thank you for your consideration and your leadership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=2656)|
| 0:44:20| Thank you, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=2660)|
| 0:44:22| Now, Mr. Bourgeois, you have up to two minutes in rebuttal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=2662)|
| 0:44:27| The first thing I'd like to do is apologize to Betty Jo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=2667)|
| 0:44:30| I'm not sure where I got married Jo at, but I've never been real good at names.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=2670)|
| 0:44:35| I guess my issue with it is, and I've, like I say, been in real estate 30 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=2675)|
| 0:44:39| is if I bought the property subject to the zoning and I came forward and you turned me down, that's one thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=2679)|
| 0:44:45| But to take something I've bought and invested in, especially so long ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=2685)|
| 0:44:49| and the reasons I bought it for, and then change that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=2689)|
| 0:44:54| and to be changed by a process that's regular mail,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=2694)|
| 0:44:57| and I've heard that argued it's too expensive to send certified mail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=2697)|
| 0:45:01| Well, for certified mail, you just mail it to the people whose property you're potentially going to change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=2701)|
| 0:45:05| The whole mail-out, the whole group, you don't have to mail everybody certified,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=2705)|
| 0:45:08| but just the people that would be affected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=2708)|
| 0:45:10| At that point, it wouldn't be that expensive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=2710)|
| 0:45:13| When you buy and invest in something and you think that's what you're buying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=2713)|
| 0:45:18| I mean, I didn't buy that land for the land itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=2718)|
| 0:45:20| I bought it for what I could do with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=2720)|
| 0:45:22| And so to diminish it so much in value, and quite honestly to affect my family so much,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=2722)|
| 0:45:27| I mean, we all look at what we think our retirement years will be like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=2727)|
| 0:45:30| We look at our health problems we're having and what that costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=2730)|
| 0:45:33| And all of a sudden, if you look at your net sheet and it just goes down by that amount,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=2733)|
| 0:45:37| it's, oh, we mailed you a card, regular mail, sorry you didn't know about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=2737)|
| 0:45:41| There's not been much question about if I would have known about that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=2741)|
| 0:45:45| that I could have raised my hand and then I'm $250,000 to the better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=2745)|
| 0:45:49| It's just an unfair way for me to be affected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=2749)|
| 0:45:54| And that's not even getting into the fact of the affordable housing side of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=2754)|
| 0:45:59| I mean, where this property is located, as I've said before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=2759)|
| 0:46:02| it's right by a major intersection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=2762)|
| 0:46:04| It's one lot off commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=2764)|
| 0:46:05| It is apartment-type land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=2765)|
| 0:46:07| When I used to develop it back in the day, before I lost the stomach for it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=2767)|
| 0:46:11| is they would tell you, don't bring us something that doesn't conform.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=2771)|
| 0:46:14| Well, here I'm where something conforms too much apparently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=2774)|
| 0:46:17| because I'm told, oh, there's too many apartments, we don't want as many apartments there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=2777)|
| 0:46:20| Well, I am conforming in this case,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=2780)|
| 0:46:22| so I just don't think it's fair to strip me and affect my family of something I've invested in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=2782)|
| 0:46:27| and was such a, what I view as a flawed process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=2787)|
| 0:46:30| And that's why it's caught the attention of legislatures too, by the way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=2790)|
| 0:46:34| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=2794)|
| 0:46:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=2795)|
| 0:46:37| We'll start with Councilman Campin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=2797)|
| 0:46:39| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=2799)|
| 0:46:42| Mr. Bourgeois still has the right to develop this property, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=2802)|
| 0:46:46| I think it's, with setbacks and everything, at least four dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=2806)|
| 0:46:52| Considering the moves we've made as a council body to protect the neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=2812)|
| 0:46:57| and stabilize the single families, which this would be right up against,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=2817)|
| 0:47:01| and looking at the ingress-egress issues off the road, I'm going to emotionally deny this request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=2821)|
| 0:47:07| He still can profit greatly, I believe, with his proposed plan and development going forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=2827)|
| 0:47:12| so that's my motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=2832)|
| 0:47:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=2837)|
| 0:47:18| Councilman Della Vopi, is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=2838)|
| 0:47:19| Yeah, I'll second it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=2839)|
| 0:47:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=2840)|
| 0:47:21| And Councilman Della Vopi?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=2841)|
| 0:47:23| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=2843)|
| 0:47:24| You know, this is a tough case in one sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=2844)|
| 0:47:28| There was, first of all, there was a lengthy process that the community went through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=2848)|
| 0:47:35| to come up with a small area plan working with MPC and to try to control the density| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=2855)|
| 0:47:42| and the activity there that was being overwhelmed by the number of apartments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=2862)|
| 0:47:47| and R2 kinds of zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=2867)|
| 0:47:49| And that general rezoning was one of the steps they took, I think, as a community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=2869)|
| 0:47:56| and as a group to try to protect their area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=2876)|
| 0:47:59| And I think it's important that we respect that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=2879)|
| 0:48:02| On the other hand, you know, he makes a case that he didn't receive notice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=2882)|
| 0:48:08| Now, I think in the earlier packet about six months ago, he made two comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=2888)|
| 0:48:13| One was, I didn't receive notice or I didn't pay attention to it or know what it was really about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=2893)|
| 0:48:18| I didn't understand it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=2898)|
| 0:48:20| But be that as it may, that's kind of a hard case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=2900)|
| 0:48:23| On the other hand, you know, practicing law, there are dozens of statutes that require notice by mail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=2903)|
| 0:48:30| And typically, the law says, as a presumption at least, you can rebut it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=2910)|
| 0:48:36| but that if you mail something properly addressed to a party,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=2916)|
| 0:48:40| it's presumed that the U.S. Postal Service has delivered it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=2920)|
| 0:48:44| Now, maybe a postcard doesn't whack you in the head and get your attention| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=2924)|
| 0:48:50| as well as a certified mail letter or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=2930)|
| 0:48:53| But I think we have to discount that somewhat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=2933)|
| 0:48:57| It is unfair in this sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=2937)|
| 0:48:59| I remember we had that meeting and people were allowed to opt out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=2939)|
| 0:49:04| and a list was read when we adopted the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=2944)|
| 0:49:07| And from what he says, he would have loved to have known enough| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=2947)|
| 0:49:12| or paid attention enough to get on that list because it does affect his investment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=2952)|
| 0:49:18| And like he said, he bought it with an existing zone that would have allowed this development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=2958)|
| 0:49:25| But I think our job is broader than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=2965)|
| 0:49:28| I think it counts as legal notice whether he read it or not, whether he paid attention or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=2968)|
| 0:49:34| And so I'm reluctant to go along with an exemption here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=2974)|
| 0:49:43| where it tends to upset the very apple cart that this community has worked so hard to establish,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=2983)|
| 0:49:49| and that is a major rezoning that protects the area and helps its future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=2989)|
| 0:49:56| And I think that I have to vote against his appeal on that basis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=2996)|
| 0:50:01| and on the basis that I have to assume that he got notice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=3001)|
| 0:50:04| Now, maybe in the future MPC can do something different| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=3004)|
| 0:50:08| where the individual properties or owners are being affected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=3008)|
| 0:50:13| I don't know if they can or cannot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=3013)|
| 0:50:15| But I think legal notice was sent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=3015)|
| 0:50:18| It's unfortunate he didn't act in time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=3018)|
| 0:50:20| But I think our duty is to protect the ongoing health of this community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=3020)|
| 0:50:25| So I'm going to vote against his appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=3025)|
| 0:50:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=3028)|
| 0:50:29| Councilman Stair?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=3029)|
| 0:50:30| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=3030)|
| 0:50:31| I guess I had a question for Mr. Bourgeois.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=3031)|
| 0:50:32| Do you have any plans to develop the property now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=3032)|
| 0:50:36| I would like to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=3036)|
| 0:50:38| And to Mark's comment about I could still make money at it, I can prove to you I've got $250,000 and four and a half acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=3038)|
| 0:50:46| And part of what, you know, when you buy a Mercedes, you've paid for a Mercedes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=3046)|
| 0:50:49| And if you turn it into a Chevrolet, you know, you don't still have what you paid for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=3049)|
| 0:50:54| I can't develop that property now and make money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=3054)|
| 0:50:57| So my hands are tied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=3057)|
| 0:50:59| I mean, if you take what the zoning allows now and I develop it, I literally will have more in the lots than the lots are worth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=3059)|
| 0:51:04| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=3064)|
| 0:51:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=3065)|
| 0:51:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=3066)|
| 0:51:07| I'm going to support Mr. Campin's motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=3067)|
| 0:51:10| But I think we all know that zoning can be changed in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=3070)|
| 0:51:16| And I think if plans are presented potentially to the community where it's an attractive development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=3076)|
| 0:51:20| and even if it's at a higher density, but if it's a real asset to the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=3080)|
| 0:51:25| I think the community would get behind it and this council or a future council would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=3085)|
| 0:51:30| But it is a tough case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=3090)|
| 0:51:32| But I think what Mr. De La Lope, in terms of the integrity of the process, lead me to support Mr. Campin's motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=3092)|
| 0:51:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=3102)|
| 0:51:43| Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=3103)|
| 0:51:44| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=3104)|
| 0:51:45| And briefly, I concur with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=3105)|
| 0:51:49| They went through a long process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=3109)|
| 0:51:50| We're not here to undo the zoning that was already undone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=3110)|
| 0:51:54| We can't go back on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=3114)|
| 0:51:57| That process happened and they had the legal right to do it and the notice and all that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=3117)|
| 0:52:02| We're not here to debate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=3122)|
| 0:52:04| And without some specific plans, you know, there's no justification to get it back to an R2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=3124)|
| 0:52:10| I think if your plans were before us and you were ready to present it and the neighborhood was behind it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=3130)|
| 0:52:16| it might look a lot different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=3136)|
| 0:52:17| So I wouldn't wipe it out, but I think if you come with specific plans,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=3137)|
| 0:52:22| then it might look a lot different to what can happen on that property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=3142)|
| 0:52:27| So I'm going to support Mark's motion as well for that reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=3147)|
| 0:52:34| Any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=3154)|
| 0:52:36| So we have a motion and a second to deny the appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=3156)|
| 0:52:40| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=3160)|
| 0:52:41| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=3161)|
| 0:52:42| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=3162)|
| 0:52:44| So it passes eight with one abstention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=3164)|
| 0:52:49| Motion to deny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=3169)|
| 0:52:51| Passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=3171)|
| 0:52:54| Right, which means that 10B is moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=3174)|
| 0:52:58| So we now go on to the appeal, 10C.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=3178)|
| 0:53:02| 10C is an appeal by Deborah Thomas of an approval for a certificate of appropriateness granted to Daniel Mitchell,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=3182)|
| 0:53:10| by the Enfield Housing Design Review Committee for a property located at 431 East Springdale Avenue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=3190)|
| 0:53:17| which decision was appealed to MPC by Deborah Thomas, William Hutton, and Emily Ellis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=3197)|
| 0:53:22| neighborhood residents and members of the Oakwood-Lincoln Park Neighborhood Association,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=3202)|
| 0:53:26| in which denial by MPC is now being further appealed to City Council, 5th District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=3206)|
| 0:53:33| Okay, we have some people signed up to speak for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=3213)|
| 0:53:36| Mark's night, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=3216)|
| 0:53:38| Yay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=3218)|
| 0:53:39| Yeah, his district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=3219)|
| 0:53:40| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=3220)|
| 0:53:41| So for the appeal are Deborah Thomas, Jeremiah Parunak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=3221)|
| 0:53:49| Did I say that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=3229)|
| 0:53:50| And Mark Harmon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=3230)|
| 0:53:52| Are you all here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=3232)|
| 0:53:53| Okay, why don't you come down in that order or whatever order you want,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=3233)|
| 0:53:57| and you each have up to five minutes to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=3237)|
| 0:54:04| Please state your name and address for the record to start, and thanks for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=3244)|
| 0:54:11| Hello, my name is Deborah Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=3251)|
| 0:54:13| I've lived in Oakwood-Lincoln Park for 20 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=3253)|
| 0:54:16| I live on Burwell Avenue at 428 in a Victorian house built in 1906.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=3256)|
| 0:54:22| I would like to thank City Council members that have listened to me through phone calls, email,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=3262)|
| 0:54:26| and even driven through our neighborhood to see what was going on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=3266)|
| 0:54:32| and all the people from the city that have also been very helpful with phone calls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=3272)|
| 0:54:36| We have petitions signed by Oakwood-Lincoln Park residents as well as residents from nearby neighborhoods,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=3276)|
| 0:54:43| and we have quite a few people here with us in the audience tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=3283)|
| 0:54:50| We're under an onslaught of construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=3290)|
| 0:54:52| In the past six months, we've had four new houses built, all with design issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=3292)|
| 0:54:56| that do not match our current infill overlay guidelines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=3296)|
| 0:54:59| I'm here to raise awareness of this and ask for strengthening of the guidelines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=3299)|
| 0:55:05| I'm also here to protest a house that does not fit the guidelines before it can be built.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=3305)|
| 0:55:10| I want to be clear that Oakwood-Lincoln Park Neighborhood Association welcomes new members,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=3310)|
| 0:55:14| including Habitat residents, but we do not welcome houses that are architecturally inappropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=3314)|
| 0:55:21| This brings us to the current issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=3321)|
| 0:55:23| We've had several new houses built that have design issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=3323)|
| 0:55:26| You can refer to your 20-page packet to see pictures of the details,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=3326)|
| 0:55:29| because it would take us all night to explain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=3329)|
| 0:55:33| Habitat built one of the recent houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=3333)|
| 0:55:35| The others were built by private contractors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=3335)|
| 0:55:38| So contrary to what Danny Mitchell has said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=3338)|
| 0:55:40| it's not true that no one but Habitat wants to build in established neighborhoods,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=3340)|
| 0:55:44| because 75% of our recent new houses have been built by private contractors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=3344)|
| 0:55:50| In February, Habitat demolished a Queen Anne Victorian on Springdale Avenue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=3350)|
| 0:55:54| built around 1906 in the oldest section of our neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=3354)|
| 0:55:58| An offer to buy and restore the house was turned down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=3358)|
| 0:56:01| The majority of the houses on the 400 block of Springdale are Victorians,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=3361)|
| 0:56:05| originally 11, now only 9 remain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=3365)|
| 0:56:09| The 1970s brick house next to the now vacant lot where Habitat plans to build| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=3369)|
| 0:56:14| was constructed after the original Victorian burned down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=3374)|
| 0:56:17| Habitat would like to use this late addition as a comparison for their planned house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=3377)|
| 0:56:22| But this house is the poster child for having the infill overlay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=3382)|
| 0:56:29| The appeal encompasses the following three points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=3389)|
| 0:56:32| The front porch design.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=3392)|
| 0:56:34| Habitat finally agreed to a different front porch design,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=3394)|
| 0:56:36| but they admitted that this is less complicated for their volunteers to build,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=3396)|
| 0:56:40| so this is not really a concession.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=3400)|
| 0:56:43| The rear door entry position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=3403)|
| 0:56:45| There should not be a side door in our neighborhood with narrow lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=3405)|
| 0:56:49| The rear entry door should be on the back of the house where the parking is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=3409)|
| 0:56:53| for safety and privacy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=3413)|
| 0:56:55| This could be accomplished with an appropriate sized house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=3415)|
| 0:56:58| Habitat has a plan for a three-bedroom with rear doors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=3418)|
| 0:57:01| This also eases our parking problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=3421)|
| 0:57:04| Habitat has stated in recent emails that they now have a five-bedroom plan with a back door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=3424)|
| 0:57:08| We have not had the opportunity to see this plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=3428)|
| 0:57:12| The roof pitch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=3432)|
| 0:57:13| We conceded to a lower roof pitch of 7 over 12 when meeting with the Habitat board members,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=3433)|
| 0:57:18| and there was an offer to help financially with the increased cost from Knox Heritage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=3438)|
| 0:57:23| Mr. Mitchell says that a higher roof pitch cannot be constructed by volunteers and is more expensive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=3443)|
| 0:57:28| He's choosing to ignore an offer that would offset the cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=3448)|
| 0:57:32| As of today, no one has contacted Kim Trent at Knox Heritage with an estimate of the increased cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=3452)|
| 0:57:38| A critical related issue to the limited parking available in our neighborhood built on a trolley line over 100 years ago with narrow lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=3458)|
| 0:57:47| Oakwood was built for single families and is currently zoned inappropriately for a higher population density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=3467)|
| 0:57:53| This is a David and Goliath story.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=3473)|
| 0:57:55| We have a budget of $5,000 a year as a nonprofit staffed by volunteers to help over 2,500 households.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=3475)|
| 0:58:03| Their budget is 1,000 times our budget with salaried employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=3483)|
| 0:58:08| They build 20 to 25 houses a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=3488)|
| 0:58:11| They don't appear to respect the guidelines for our neighborhood that were established to protect its historic nature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=3491)|
| 0:58:19| Habitat should have moved this worthy family to another property at the beginning back in March.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=3499)|
| 0:58:24| We have demonstrated an interest in working with the neighborhood to avoid future demolitions and, more appropriately, styled houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=3504)|
| 0:58:32| Habitat has built better homes in other areas such as Mechanicsville neighborhood and the Hope 6 projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=3512)|
| 0:58:39| This issue is not about this family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=3519)|
| 0:58:42| This is not about other Habitat families which are an asset to our area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=3522)|
| 0:58:46| This is about infill guidelines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=3526)|
| 0:58:48| This is about Habitat management decisions and budget priorities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=3528)|
| 0:58:51| This is about a historic neighborhood that is experiencing revitalization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=3531)|
| 0:58:55| People move here from out of state and choose this neighborhood for its historic houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=3535)|
| 0:58:59| This is about a neighborhood that needs down zoning to protect it from unscrupulous developers and inappropriate sized houses and apartment buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=3539)|
| 0:59:06| We shouldn't have to legislate every detail of the guidelines to force developers to do the right thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=3546)|
| 0:59:11| Our houses are worth far more in tax revenues with restoration than a modern-| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=3551)|
| 0:59:15| Include, Mr. Thomas. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=3555)|
| 0:59:17| Please uphold our appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=3557)|
| 0:59:19| Send the developers back to the drawing board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=3559)|
| 0:59:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=3561)|
| 0:59:22| Thank you, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=3562)|
| 0:59:24| Mr. Jeremiah, how do you pronounce your last name?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=3564)|
| 0:59:29| Paranac, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=3569)|
| 0:59:30| Paranac.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=3570)|
| 0:59:31| Yes, ma'am. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=3571)|
| 0:59:32| Well, we're glad to have you here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=3572)|
| 0:59:33| Please state your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=3573)|
| 0:59:35| I'll set the timer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=3575)|
| 0:59:36| Jeremiah Paranac and I have a home at 420 Burwell Avenue, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37917.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=3576)|
| 0:59:43| I'm mayor, council, and officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=3583)|
| 0:59:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=3585)|
| 0:59:46| And I'm here for three reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=3586)|
| 0:59:51| One is to recall to your attention some of the things that transpired at the MPC meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=3591)|
| 0:59:57| which denied this appeal, bringing us to this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=3597)|
| 1:00:00| Two, some of the merits of the appeal, and also my intentions for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=3600)|
| 1:00:10| So at the MPC meeting, two comments that I'd like to call to this body's attention was one by Mr. Mitchell,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=3610)|
| 1:00:20| and it was if I could paraphrase something to the effect of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=3620)|
| 1:00:23| he is building a house in places where people don't want to build houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=3623)|
| 1:00:28| And as kindly as I can, I think Mr. Mitchell is remiss in acknowledging our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=3628)|
| 1:00:34| I think any developer coming in with that kind of an attitude is remiss.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=3634)|
| 1:00:38| It is offensive, and it's very unprofessional.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=3638)|
| 1:00:41| But we can and are very forgiving of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=3641)|
| 1:00:43| We understand Habitat for Humanity's mission, and we fully support it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=3643)|
| 1:00:48| But I do want to call that to your attention, is that that attitude is inappropriate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=3648)|
| 1:00:53| but it's not altogether out of place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=3653)|
| 1:00:56| For many people have that sentiment of our neighborhood, which is to the dismay of our fair city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=3656)|
| 1:01:02| That is a wonderful asset that we have there in North Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=3662)|
| 1:01:06| The other comment that I wanted to bring to your attention was that of Chair Longmire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=3666)|
| 1:01:10| She said that the county's population is growing faster than the road budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=3670)|
| 1:01:15| These historic neighborhoods already have roads in them, and they have sidewalks in them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=3675)|
| 1:01:21| They have wonderful architecture in them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=3681)|
| 1:01:23| They have very short commutes in them, and they have wonderful communities in them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=3683)|
| 1:01:27| Where we've lived and have developed wonderful relationships with our neighbors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=3687)|
| 1:01:32| it is truly an asset to community of diversity and just getting along and living along together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=3692)|
| 1:01:39| As to the merits of the appeal, the 7-6-6-12 pitch is inappropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=3699)|
| 1:01:45| The Infohousing Guidelines call the developer's attention to the block,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=3705)|
| 1:01:49| that the house should complement the block, other homes on the block.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=3709)|
| 1:01:53| And other homes on the block do not have a 5-12 or 6-12 pitch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=3713)|
| 1:01:58| So that should be acknowledged and corrected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=3718)|
| 1:02:04| The scale and mass of the house is also lacking, and even that is not caught in this appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=3724)|
| 1:02:10| That was not caught by the Infohousing Committee, and that's not caught in this appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=3730)|
| 1:02:14| So this certificate of appropriateness is truly lacking in its merits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=3734)|
| 1:02:21| As for my intent, my intent for being here is to find out what the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=3741)|
| 1:02:26| what this city's response is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=3746)|
| 1:02:30| Because I think that this, with the support of the neighborhood, as they've come out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=3750)|
| 1:02:34| and as we have all invested, I've invested tremendously, my own labor, my own money, my own time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=3754)|
| 1:02:40| and my own family there in that neighborhood against conventional wisdom of architects| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=3760)|
| 1:02:45| and against conventional wisdom of real estate agents and even family members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=3765)|
| 1:02:49| I've moved my family in there, and we've been blessed wonderfully.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=3769)|
| 1:02:53| And so I've invested largely, and my neighbors have invested largely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=3773)|
| 1:02:58| And my intention is to find out what the city of Knoxville is prepared to do for their own asset.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=3778)|
| 1:03:04| And that's what I'd like to know from you this evening, is how you are going to proceed with Infohousing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=3784)|
| 1:03:11| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=3791)|
| 1:03:14| Mr. Harmon, thank you for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=3794)|
| 1:03:17| I'll set the timer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=3797)|
| 1:03:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=3798)|
| 1:03:20| I'm Mark Harmon, 1714 North Hills Boulevard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=3800)|
| 1:03:24| It was almost exactly ten years ago this summer that I began an adventure representing these neighborhoods,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=3804)|
| 1:03:31| these neighbors, and several others on county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=3811)|
| 1:03:35| I know this neighborhood. I know it well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=3815)|
| 1:03:37| I can't tell how many times I've block walked it and gone to community meetings at OLP&A,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=3817)|
| 1:03:43| not only as their commissioner, but later, just because I love this neighborhood and I love these people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=3823)|
| 1:03:49| And let me just explain to you that these folks are being quite reasonable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=3829)|
| 1:03:54| We're talking about Infohousing guidelines that are not being respected,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=3834)|
| 1:03:59| and the neighborhood is quite willing to be reasonable and compromise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=3839)|
| 1:04:03| We haven't seen the same thing from Habitat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=3843)|
| 1:04:06| Aside from the aforementioned item about porches, things that are very important,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=3846)|
| 1:04:12| such as roof pitch, back door versus rear door, the size of the foundation, the size of the overall property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=3852)|
| 1:04:21| there were ways to redesign to make this property compatible and an asset to the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=3861)|
| 1:04:28| But Habitat, a wonderful organization, is perhaps leaning too heavily on the goodwill that it rightly enjoys,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=3868)|
| 1:04:35| and instead of compromising with the neighbors, is simply hoping to get by,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=3875)|
| 1:04:40| hoping to push it through. If you vote to support this appeal, you'll be saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=3880)|
| 1:04:46| no, you have to show compromise, you have to show moderation, and you have to work with the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=3886)|
| 1:04:52| when they're being reasonable, when they're accepting compromise, and with a few modest exceptions, you are not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=3892)|
| 1:04:59| So let us send them back to the drawing board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=3899)|
| 1:05:02| Let us say, when you come to this commission, when you come to this city council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=3902)|
| 1:05:08| you should expect to work things out. You were given two-week extension to work things out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=3908)|
| 1:05:15| and you really didn't compromise with a very willing-to-compromise neighborhood association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=3915)|
| 1:05:20| Do better. That would be the message of upholding this appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=3920)|
| 1:05:24| Do better and come back with something better. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=3924)|
| 1:05:27| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=3927)|
| 1:05:30| Now, Mr. Mitchell, and do you have others here to speak, or are you just speaking yourself?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=3930)|
| 1:05:38| Okay. If you would like to start, please state your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=3938)|
| 1:05:43| You have up to five minutes, and thank you for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=3943)|
| 1:05:47| Thank you. My name is Danny Mitchell. I represent Knoxville Habitat at 1501 Washington Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=3947)|
| 1:05:54| I've heard a lot of misquotes and taken out of context of many things that I've said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=3954)|
| 1:05:59| One thing is we do build in undesirable places. We take blighted property that has sat idle for years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=3959)|
| 1:06:06| We build houses on them and put them back on the tax road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=3966)|
| 1:06:09| This past year, homeowners at Knoxville Habitat have contributed $330,000 to the tax burden of the city and county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=3969)|
| 1:06:20| If you take the fact that we've been in business for 30 years, that translates into millions of dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=3980)|
| 1:06:26| We are one of the largest general contractors building single-family homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=3986)|
| 1:06:31| So to answer some of the other things, we do have a place in the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=3991)|
| 1:06:37| We've worked hard in the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=3997)|
| 1:06:41| I was reminded that we've built 40 infill houses, which are typically on lots that come from community development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=4001)|
| 1:06:47| or from another department, the county, somebody that doesn't want the lots, and we build on them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=4007)|
| 1:06:53| When we go to infill, there's been very few times that I've not had to go back to the drawing board and refine stuff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=4013)|
| 1:07:00| put in more windows, rearrange stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=4020)|
| 1:07:03| I've always been willing to do that, and we've always gotten along to this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=4023)|
| 1:07:08| The three points, as Debbie pointed out, are the front porch design, the back door request, and the pitch of the roof.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=4028)|
| 1:07:17| The front porch design, we accept it. It's a gable roof.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=4037)|
| 1:07:21| They wanted a hip roof, a shed hip roof, which is built two blocks down from where Debbie Thomas lives with no objection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=4041)|
| 1:07:30| We have seven houses in the Oakwood-Lincoln Park neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=4050)|
| 1:07:34| Our 500th house was there, which some of you may be familiar with, with no objections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=4054)|
| 1:07:39| As a matter of fact, some of the members of the Oakwood-Lincoln Park Neighborhood Association have complimented our houses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=4059)|
| 1:07:45| and the way they were set up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=4065)|
| 1:07:50| The pitch of the roof is the only issue remaining because we do now have, and you should have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=4070)|
| 1:07:56| a packet that starts out with a color picture of the two houses on the side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=4076)|
| 1:08:00| It was passed out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=4080)|
| 1:08:02| So it does show the pitch of the roof, the floor design, where we put in a back door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=4082)|
| 1:08:08| We talk about negotiation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=4088)|
| 1:08:10| We talk about coming together, and Mark was very good in giving us a four-week delay so we could come together, and we came together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=4090)|
| 1:08:19| And the thing that happens on every meeting that we come together with this neighborhood, they can see nothing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=4099)|
| 1:08:24| They want us to change to their way explicitly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=4104)|
| 1:08:30| But we use volunteers to build our houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=4110)|
| 1:08:33| We have International Habitat in Atlanta, and they require us to use safety boards around our roof.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=4113)|
| 1:08:41| So we designed them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=4121)|
| 1:08:42| They're approved by OSHA, and we use them on every roof that we build.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=4122)|
| 1:08:46| They're built for a 5-12 pitch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=4126)|
| 1:08:48| Our volunteers range from college-age students to 60-plus, including myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=4128)|
| 1:08:54| And so it's not that they're experienced roofers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=4134)|
| 1:08:58| They need to be on a roof that they can work on safely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=4138)|
| 1:09:02| The cost of establishing that roof and putting that roof up is zero.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=4142)|
| 1:09:08| On the first day that we build, we build the outside walls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=4148)|
| 1:09:12| We set the trusses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=4152)|
| 1:09:13| We put the decking on the roof, and we put the felt on the roof.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=4153)|
| 1:09:17| That's part of the first day experience of a Habitat Blitz build.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=4157)|
| 1:09:21| Without putting up the roof, it's a half day, and our volunteers do not get to experience what they want to experience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=4161)|
| 1:09:28| It would cost $4,000 to $5,000 easily to have a contractor and a crane come out and set all this stuff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=4168)|
| 1:09:35| which would mean that we couldn't build as many houses because it would cost that much money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=4175)|
| 1:09:44| Let's see, where am I?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=4184)|
| 1:09:46| You have one minute, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=4186)|
| 1:09:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=4187)|
| 1:09:48| The house is 34-foot wide, and that means half of it's 17.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=4188)|
| 1:09:52| And if you understand roof pitch, which I don't expect many of you to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=4192)|
| 1:09:56| a 5-12 means that for every 12 inches, you go up five inches.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=4196)|
| 1:10:00| The difference between a 6-12 and a 5-12 at the peak of the roof is one foot and five inches,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=4200)|
| 1:10:07| and that's what we're here about tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=4207)|
| 1:10:10| Let me tell you just really quickly about the family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=4210)|
| 1:10:13| The family has a husband and wife and five children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=4213)|
| 1:10:17| They have a toddler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=4217)|
| 1:10:19| They have two students in UT pre-med school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=4219)|
| 1:10:22| So that's the diversity of the family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=4222)|
| 1:10:25| The man in the family goes to Holy Ghost Catholic, and he works there, and the ministry is there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=4225)|
| 1:10:31| This is about five minutes from his house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=4231)|
| 1:10:34| This is our mission statement, and I'll conclude.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=4234)|
| 1:10:37| The mission statement for Habitat is to seeking to put God's love into action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=4237)|
| 1:10:42| Knoxville Habitat for Humanity brings people together to build homes, communities, and hope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=4242)|
| 1:10:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=4247)|
| 1:10:50| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=4250)|
| 1:10:57| Sir, please state your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=4257)|
| 1:10:59| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=4259)|
| 1:11:00| My name is Mike Shamblin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=4260)|
| 1:11:01| I live at 7121 Crest Hill Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=4261)|
| 1:11:03| I'll be brief with my comments, because I think Danny has done an excellent job of summarizing the situation for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=4263)|
| 1:11:09| But I do think it's important to highlight a few more things about the family and the way that it works at Habitat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=4269)|
| 1:11:14| I know I even had a misconception when I first joined the board that Habitat was giving houses away,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=4274)|
| 1:11:19| and, of course, that's not what happens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=4279)|
| 1:11:21| These families invest 500 hours of sweat equity going through budgeting classes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=4281)|
| 1:11:25| learning how to be responsible homeowners, learning how to improve their finances and budgeting techniques.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=4285)|
| 1:11:30| So this family has really worked hard, and they specifically picked this lot for all the reasons that Danny stated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=4290)|
| 1:11:36| It just makes sense, and this is where they want to be home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=4296)|
| 1:11:38| Someone made the comment earlier that Habitat has not been willing to compromise,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=4298)|
| 1:11:42| and I couldn't disagree with that statement more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=4302)|
| 1:11:45| There are really three items that I think this boils down to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=4305)|
| 1:11:48| They've been summarized several times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=4308)|
| 1:11:50| There was a request for us to redo the porch, and we've completely redesigned that to meet the request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=4310)|
| 1:11:57| So I believe that one is settled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=4317)|
| 1:11:59| There was a request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=4319)|
| 1:12:00| As a matter of fact, at the last MPC meeting, this was, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=4320)|
| 1:12:03| where primarily all of the discussion was consumed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=4323)|
| 1:12:07| There was discussion about we had a side door, and they wanted to move to the rear of the house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=4327)|
| 1:12:11| We completely redesigned the house design, actually made a smaller bedroom for this family, unfortunately,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=4331)|
| 1:12:17| but we were able to redesign and move the door to the rear of the house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=4337)|
| 1:12:20| So that request has fully been met.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=4340)|
| 1:12:22| Danny's described the roof pitch situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=4342)|
| 1:12:25| It's just simply unsafe for our volunteer workforce, and our volunteers are so key| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=4345)|
| 1:12:29| because without the volunteer workforce, it costs so much more to build these houses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=4349)|
| 1:12:33| and we then can't turn around and build the next house that we need to build to help another family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=4353)|
| 1:12:37| So for safety concerns, we just simply have to stick to the 512 pitch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=4357)|
| 1:12:41| But that would be Habitat compromising fully on two of the three requests,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=4361)|
| 1:12:46| and we feel like we're very close, literally within inches of meeting the third request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=4366)|
| 1:12:51| And so I do believe we've compromised and just wanted to share those few additional brief comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=4371)|
| 1:12:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=4376)|
| 1:12:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=4378)|
| 1:13:00| And now the appellants have up to two minutes in rebuttal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=4380)|
| 1:13:02| If you choose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=4382)|
| 1:13:15| Let's state your name again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=4395)|
| 1:13:17| I beg your pardon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=4397)|
| 1:13:18| Jeremiah Paranac, 420 East Burwell, Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=4398)|
| 1:13:24| Compromise is not my concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=4404)|
| 1:13:28| This is a very good document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=4408)|
| 1:13:31| This is a very good document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=4411)|
| 1:13:33| And as a developer developing in a community that is overlaid by the rules and regulations of this document,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=4413)|
| 1:13:41| they need to comply with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=4421)|
| 1:13:44| That seems to be the long and the short of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=4424)|
| 1:13:46| It does not seem to be a matter of compromise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=4426)|
| 1:13:49| The safety of their workers I fully agree with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=4429)|
| 1:13:53| We don't need to have nobody getting hurt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=4433)|
| 1:13:59| You know, this says you've got to have that roof, so you can't use those volunteers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=4439)|
| 1:14:02| It just seems to be that simple.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=4442)|
| 1:14:04| They said they're the largest contractors of single homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=4444)|
| 1:14:07| It seems to me they could find a resource to do such.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=4447)|
| 1:14:12| As far as the community, you know, my wife has been in that house that was seen as derelict,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=4452)|
| 1:14:18| such that they would tear it down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=4458)|
| 1:14:20| I've had their children in my home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=4460)|
| 1:14:22| Okay, we share in our community, and we believe in what they're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=4462)|
| 1:14:26| We agree with Habitat for Humanity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=4466)|
| 1:14:29| And while it is not a matter to be really considered here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=4469)|
| 1:14:32| just maybe worth noting that Habitat for Humanity does have a neighborhood revitalization program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=4472)|
| 1:14:37| which might have been more appropriate in this case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=4477)|
| 1:14:40| Rather than destroying a 100-year-old Queen Anne home,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=4480)|
| 1:14:43| they might have applied that program of their own to this house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=4483)|
| 1:14:48| So anyway, this is not about being contentious or fighting the big developer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=4488)|
| 1:14:52| We believe in what they're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=4492)|
| 1:14:53| We believe in helping folks out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=4493)|
| 1:14:55| There's no question about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=4495)|
| 1:14:56| But again, this infill housing guideline is no good if we don't respect it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=4496)|
| 1:15:02| And that's all we're here for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=4502)|
| 1:15:03| And if anybody, I've got an example of one of their homes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=4503)|
| 1:15:06| and I can tell you I'll be happy to take the time with anybody to show them how it falls short of these guidelines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=4506)|
| 1:15:12| Again, not in contention, but just out of awareness for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=4512)|
| 1:15:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=4516)|
| 1:15:17| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=4517)|
| 1:15:18| Okay, council, that's all the speakers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=4518)|
| 1:15:23| Councilman Campin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=4523)|
| 1:15:25| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=4525)|
| 1:15:27| Well, obviously it's an unfortunate situation here with this one as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=4527)|
| 1:15:32| You know, we tried for weeks to work this out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=4532)|
| 1:15:35| and come to something that both sides could be happy with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=4535)|
| 1:15:39| But I think it is important that we really need to look going forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=4539)|
| 1:15:44| and this is just the case that it falls on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=4544)|
| 1:15:47| This is the development infill housing development that it falls on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=4547)|
| 1:15:51| You know, you draw a line in the sand as a neighborhood to say we've got to see something better going forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=4551)|
| 1:15:56| and Oakwood-Lincoln Park for, in my opinion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=4556)|
| 1:15:59| too long has been neglected to have the respect it deserves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=4559)|
| 1:16:03| So, you know, I really thought we would get there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=4563)|
| 1:16:08| All these points that Habitat did try to meet, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=4568)|
| 1:16:13| they came so close but still failed to reach the infill housing guidelines,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=4573)|
| 1:16:17| which in essence in the long term needs to be strengthened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=4577)|
| 1:16:21| We need to give legal teeth to this document, not just it should be followed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=4581)|
| 1:16:27| but it shall be followed when it comes to a neighborhood like this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=4587)|
| 1:16:30| and any other historic neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=4590)|
| 1:16:32| And also going forward looking at the C.B. Atkins portion of Oakwood-Lincoln Park| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=4592)|
| 1:16:36| or the greater area, you know, we're definitely going to need sooner rather than later| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=4596)|
| 1:16:40| change some of the zoning for this neighborhood and down zone and protect this neighborhood further.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=4600)|
| 1:16:45| And if there are merits for historic zoning overlay, then we need to investigate that option, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=4605)|
| 1:16:50| But I'm going to support the neighborhood's appeal and make that a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=4610)|
| 1:16:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=4615)|
| 1:16:56| It's a motion to approve the appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=4616)|
| 1:16:59| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=4619)|
| 1:17:00| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=4620)|
| 1:17:01| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=4621)|
| 1:17:04| Councilman Dela Vopi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=4624)|
| 1:17:06| Yes, thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=4626)|
| 1:17:08| You know, when I looked at this packet, I was looking at the infill guidelines,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=4628)|
| 1:17:13| and I think folks mentioned guideline number four and seven without naming them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=4633)|
| 1:17:18| but guideline four clearly recommends or requires that you observe the scale| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=4638)|
| 1:17:25| and the mass of the houses in that area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=4645)|
| 1:17:28| and it specifically mentions not only, you know, foundation heights and first floor elevations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=4648)|
| 1:17:34| but the size and shape of roofs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=4654)|
| 1:17:37| And then when you look at number seven, roof shapes and materials,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=4657)|
| 1:17:43| it says new roofs should be designed to have a similar pitch to the original housing on the block.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=4663)|
| 1:17:50| And then it talks about more complex houses with their hips and whatnot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=4670)|
| 1:17:53| If you ride down this block and you start at the northeast corner sandwich shop,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=4673)|
| 1:17:59| which has some of the best sandwiches in the city of Knoxville, I must add,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=4679)|
| 1:18:04| and you go down this block, there are some gorgeous craftsmen houses and workingmen's houses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=4684)|
| 1:18:09| and a lot of them have really unusual roofs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=4689)|
| 1:18:12| Some of them have really sharp peaks with dormers and stuff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=4692)|
| 1:18:15| but they're more of a style of an era that's gone by.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=4695)|
| 1:18:21| And I would think that Habitat, even though they've been doing wonderful work in the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=4701)|
| 1:18:26| and I don't quarrel with that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=4706)|
| 1:18:28| I think that Habitat should come into a neighborhood like that and ask the question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=4708)|
| 1:18:32| how can I build good housing for families and enhance the neighborhood, not detract from it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=4712)|
| 1:18:40| And we went from years ago where there were no porches and just boxes to some pretty nice houses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=4720)|
| 1:18:46| but this is a historic neighborhood with a look.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=4726)|
| 1:18:50| And, okay, not every house is like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=4730)|
| 1:18:52| And we were given a picture where someone built a more modern house that looks, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=4732)|
| 1:18:58| a lot worse than what they're proposing, its narrow roof and everything else,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=4738)|
| 1:19:01| but the majority of this block is of an era,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=4741)|
| 1:19:06| and I really think they've got to find a way in their business to get as close as they can to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=4746)|
| 1:19:12| Maybe they're not going to do a 12-12 pitch roof.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=4752)|
| 1:19:15| I happen to have one of those in my house, and they're hard to be on, to be honest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=4755)|
| 1:19:19| But they're talking 6-12,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=4759)|
| 1:19:21| and I don't know whether they can recruit special construction workers who volunteer their time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=4761)|
| 1:19:26| or hire someone out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=4766)|
| 1:19:28| but they're investing in a community that's going to have an impact for the next 50 or 60 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=4768)|
| 1:19:33| I think they need to buy into the philosophy of these guidelines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=4773)|
| 1:19:39| I've been told when there was issues in a neighborhood that didn't want a Habitat house,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=4779)|
| 1:19:45| there are some people that have prejudice against Habitat houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=4785)|
| 1:19:49| It's not fair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=4789)|
| 1:19:50| If they're in an R1 neighborhood and they follow the guidelines,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=4790)|
| 1:19:55| they go get their building permit once they present it with the adequate information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=4795)|
| 1:19:59| Here they've sidestepped a requirement that's expressed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=4799)|
| 1:20:03| that you have similar pitch to the original housing on the block.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=4803)|
| 1:20:08| I think Habitat should have to follow it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=4808)|
| 1:20:11| Maybe they shouldn't have picked that lot if they didn't want to follow it, but that's the rule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=4811)|
| 1:20:14| I think they should conform and help that neighborhood get healthier, not be detracted from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=4814)|
| 1:20:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=4823)|
| 1:20:24| Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=4824)|
| 1:20:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=4825)|
| 1:20:26| I guess to Dan Kelly, I'm way confused on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=4826)|
| 1:20:33| I have a drawing in front of me with a 612 pitch roof on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=4833)|
| 1:20:38| Is that what they, and that was, and that's what was approved by MPC?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=4838)|
| 1:20:45| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=4845)|
| 1:20:47| The last certificate they received would require a 612 roof.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=4847)|
| 1:20:52| So that's their drawing that they've submitted, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=4852)|
| 1:20:55| And with the 612s marked 612.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=4855)|
| 1:20:59| The last item, the last roof that they got approved was for a 612 pitch roof.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=4859)|
| 1:21:04| And they're asking for a 512 now, I believe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=4864)|
| 1:21:07| which is different than what was approved on the certificate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=4867)|
| 1:21:11| And so Ms. Thomas is challenging the 612 and it should be higher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=4871)|
| 1:21:16| And yet, if I understand, Danny Mitchell asking for a 512.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=4876)|
| 1:21:20| Can you answer that for us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=4880)|
| 1:21:23| Danny, would you like to, I mean, I'm just looking at the drawing you handed out today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=4883)|
| 1:21:28| It's 512.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=4888)|
| 1:21:29| The packet, what's in our packet, you agree, you know, it shows right there that you submitted 612.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=4889)|
| 1:21:35| Danny Mitchell, 1501 Washington Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=4895)|
| 1:21:38| Yes, we are asking for a 512.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=4898)|
| 1:21:40| And the reason is it's basically precedent setting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=4900)|
| 1:21:44| As has been quoted by Mr. Hutton, president of the organization,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=4904)|
| 1:21:48| we do have one on another street over there that's an 812.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=4908)|
| 1:21:52| We got caught into a city project over there and they said this is what it's going to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=4912)|
| 1:21:57| It's just like was mentioned, Hope 6.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=4917)|
| 1:21:59| Mr. Carberry, bless his heart, we got over there and we chose those lots| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=4919)|
| 1:22:04| because they were basically given to us so we could finish Hope 6.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=4924)|
| 1:22:08| But they said this is what you'll build and this is what you'll build and this is what you'll build.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=4928)|
| 1:22:13| And we did and we hired contractors to do all of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=4933)|
| 1:22:17| But I understand that, but you submitted 612 and you were agreeable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=4937)|
| 1:22:21| So now you're trying to go back to a 512 because she's appealing 612 to go to 812.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=4941)|
| 1:22:29| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=4949)|
| 1:22:30| So it's not that you can't build 612 and it's not that you're forbidden by Habitat to build 612.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=4950)|
| 1:22:36| It has been reported you can build 612 as you submitted the plan for 612.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=4956)|
| 1:22:40| But now you want to make it 512 because it's easier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=4960)|
| 1:22:43| Is that what you're saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=4963)|
| 1:22:44| The 612 would require a crane and a contractor to do the work and it would cost more money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=4964)|
| 1:22:51| But that's what you submitted originally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=4971)|
| 1:22:54| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=4974)|
| 1:22:59| So the MPC recommended 612.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=4979)|
| 1:23:04| You said you'd build 612.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=4984)|
| 1:23:06| They challenged it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=4986)|
| 1:23:08| And the neighborhood's saying, no, we want it to be 812.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=4988)|
| 1:23:11| And now you're saying I want it to be 512.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=4991)|
| 1:23:13| I mean, there's no, you know, that's what we're, I don't know, speak we.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=4993)|
| 1:23:16| I mean, me, that's what I was hoping that was going to get accomplished these last two weeks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=4996)|
| 1:23:20| is we wouldn't be here arguing about, you know, the pitch of roof.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=5000)|
| 1:23:24| That's unfortunate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=5004)|
| 1:23:25| I love Habitat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=5005)|
| 1:23:27| I love the mission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=5007)|
| 1:23:28| I love the house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=5008)|
| 1:23:29| And, you know, it's unfortunate we're being put in a position to get between| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=5009)|
| 1:23:33| what's best for the neighborhood and, you know, what Habitat wants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=5013)|
| 1:23:36| And that's very unfortunate for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=5016)|
| 1:23:39| And I wish it could have worked it out prior to coming here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=5019)|
| 1:23:41| Part of the infill guidelines, which I'm quite familiar with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=5021)|
| 1:23:44| because we've done quite a few houses there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=5024)|
| 1:23:47| are to make our house look like other houses in the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=5027)|
| 1:23:52| The house on the corner of Harvey and Springdale,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=5032)|
| 1:23:56| we actually call it the doctor's office because it's got a paved front yard with striped lines in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=5036)|
| 1:24:00| It is a 5-12 pitch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=5040)|
| 1:24:03| The house on the other side is an 8-12 pitch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=5043)|
| 1:24:06| And the shed porch on it is a 4-12 pitch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=5046)|
| 1:24:09| So if you look at the houses around where we're talking about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=5049)|
| 1:24:14| we're meeting the guidelines of blending into that neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=5054)|
| 1:24:18| Now, I know there's a lot of angst about us tearing down a Victorian.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=5058)|
| 1:24:23| The lot was donated to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=5063)|
| 1:24:25| The house was not repairable, not rehabble for the type of work that we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=5065)|
| 1:24:30| And that's why the house was demolished.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=5070)|
| 1:24:34| Now, I think the guidelines are there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=5074)|
| 1:24:36| And I think that this neighborhood has made a really good point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=5076)|
| 1:24:40| that they value their neighborhood and they want to see it responsible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=5080)|
| 1:24:45| You had the time and the effort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=5085)|
| 1:24:47| We could have made this work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=5087)|
| 1:24:49| And you put us in a really awkward position, I think, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=5089)|
| 1:24:52| And it's very unfortunate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=5092)|
| 1:24:54| I think I had to support Oakwood-Lincoln Park and what they presented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=5094)|
| 1:25:00| When it was right there in front of y'all, y'all could have done this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=5100)|
| 1:25:03| and satisfied it and been done with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=5103)|
| 1:25:05| So that's very unfortunate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=5105)|
| 1:25:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=5107)|
| 1:25:10| Vice Mayor Grief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=5110)|
| 1:25:12| I was going to comment on the same things that George commented on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=5112)|
| 1:25:16| In our packet, we had 6-12.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=5116)|
| 1:25:20| And then tonight we're handed a drawing that says 5-12.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=5120)|
| 1:25:23| And then I heard, I think I heard one of the neighborhood reps say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=5123)|
| 1:25:26| that there was a conversation of the possibility of a 7-12.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=5126)|
| 1:25:30| And so they're really putting us in a situation of the slope of the roof,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=5130)|
| 1:25:34| and that's really not our responsibility in this situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=5134)|
| 1:25:37| I will say this, that I think one thing, Mark, that possibly has happened is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=5137)|
| 1:25:41| this has really brought this neighborhood together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=5141)|
| 1:25:44| And you really have an opportunity to look at a conservation district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=5144)|
| 1:25:49| or historic, an H-1 district, you know, or an H-1 light,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=5149)|
| 1:25:53| in light of the interest that this has now brought forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=5153)|
| 1:25:56| So I think there's some very positive things that have come out of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=5156)|
| 1:25:59| But I'm not sure what I'm voting on in terms of if I vote on a pitch of a roof,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=5159)|
| 1:26:05| you know, in terms of what's being presented to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=5165)|
| 1:26:08| And so I think there's a problem there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=5168)|
| 1:26:11| I also don't quite understand the front porch, what's happened to it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=5171)|
| 1:26:15| in terms of what's in our packet, which is a hip roof,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=5175)|
| 1:26:18| which is now a gable roof, you know, on the drawing that was handed out to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=5178)|
| 1:26:22| So I think there's a lot of confusion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=5182)|
| 1:26:24| I'm not sure what's gone on in the last several weeks between Habitat| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=5184)|
| 1:26:28| and the neighborhood, you know, on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=5188)|
| 1:26:30| So I think there's a lot of confusion, so I'm not sure what's going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=5190)|
| 1:26:33| Mayor, do you mind if I speak to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=5193)|
| 1:26:35| Go right ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=5195)|
| 1:26:36| Well, you know, I've made the motion to support the appeal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=5196)|
| 1:26:39| but as I shared with you all from our legal counsel, we have some options here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=5199)|
| 1:26:44| We can deny, we can support, or we can condition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=5204)|
| 1:26:47| So, you know, that's what our discussion tonight is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=5207)|
| 1:26:49| I don't want to belabor it, but, you know, if we want to look at agreeing to something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=5209)|
| 1:26:54| I'm afraid either way it sends Habitat back to the drawing board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=5214)|
| 1:26:58| and to the infill department, and they have to basically start over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=5218)|
| 1:27:01| So, you know, obviously it's important enough to us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=5221)|
| 1:27:04| and important enough to the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=5224)|
| 1:27:06| If that's what we so choose, we can do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=5226)|
| 1:27:09| You know, 5-12 versus 6-12 is a matter of 17 inches difference in pitch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=5229)|
| 1:27:16| The neighborhood at one point did agree to a 7-12.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=5236)|
| 1:27:20| Is that acceptable at this point?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=5240)|
| 1:27:22| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=5242)|
| 1:27:23| You know, that's up for debate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=5243)|
| 1:27:25| And, again, we can, I guess, Rob, correct me if I'm wrong,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=5245)|
| 1:27:30| what was that third option, deny the appeal except put conditions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=5250)|
| 1:27:35| Yeah, that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=5255)|
| 1:27:36| Put conditions on it, obviously within reason,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=5256)|
| 1:27:40| but that doesn't obligate Habitat to go forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=5260)|
| 1:27:45| I mean, Habitat can say thank you but no thank you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=5265)|
| 1:27:49| and walk away and sell or let the land sit, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=5269)|
| 1:27:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=5276)|
| 1:27:59| Councilman Stare.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=5279)|
| 1:28:00| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=5280)|
| 1:28:01| I certainly agree with a lot of the comments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=5281)|
| 1:28:03| that have already been said by my colleagues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=5283)|
| 1:28:07| You know, to me it's an issue of council at some point thought it was a good idea| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=5287)|
| 1:28:12| to put overlay, infill guideline overlay over this neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=5292)|
| 1:28:18| because of its unique character and its fragile nature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=5298)|
| 1:28:25| And if you look at the guidelines, and Councilman Della Vopi read this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=5305)|
| 1:28:29| but it's supposed to have a similar pitch to the original housing on the block.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=5309)|
| 1:28:34| And that's what the guidelines say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=5314)|
| 1:28:36| That's what we passed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=5316)|
| 1:28:38| From what I understand, the original houses on the block had a 12-12 pitch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=5318)|
| 1:28:46| So that's really what should be required.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=5326)|
| 1:28:50| I certainly support Habitat for all the great work they do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=5330)|
| 1:28:56| But as a council member, part of a council that put this overlay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=5336)|
| 1:29:00| I don't think there's, you know, if we just start letting things slide through,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=5340)|
| 1:29:04| then we really defeat the purpose of having the overlay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=5344)|
| 1:29:07| So I'm going to support Mr. Campbell's motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=5347)|
| 1:29:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=5351)|
| 1:29:12| Councilwoman Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=5352)|
| 1:29:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=5353)|
| 1:29:14| This particular issue has caused a lot of serious thought| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=5354)|
| 1:29:19| and conversation with a variety of people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=5359)|
| 1:29:22| We've gone both ways on this issue over the last few days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=5362)|
| 1:29:26| whether to support the appeal, to deny the appeal, or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=5366)|
| 1:29:29| But when I finally got settled down and listed the pros and the cons of everything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=5369)|
| 1:29:35| I think that both Habitat and the community have some issues that they really need to address,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=5375)|
| 1:29:41| and this particular zoning issue has pointed those out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=5381)|
| 1:29:45| Several of my colleagues have mentioned those tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=5385)|
| 1:29:48| Oakwood-Lincoln Park neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=5388)|
| 1:29:49| you need to stop talking about an overlay, a conservation action, or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=5389)|
| 1:29:55| You need to get it done, because otherwise we're going to be back here in six months or a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=5395)|
| 1:30:01| And I know that there are people in the neighborhood who want to make this happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=5401)|
| 1:30:06| So I know that Councilman Campbell, I would certainly be happy to do what I can,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=5406)|
| 1:30:11| and I'm sure others would, but we need to get this done and stop talking about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=5411)|
| 1:30:17| When the conversation occurred six months ago or a year ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=5417)|
| 1:30:21| if something had happened then we wouldn't be here tonight dealing with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=5421)|
| 1:30:25| Now, Habitat, don't get too smug, because you have some issues also that need to be addressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=5425)|
| 1:30:30| This does have infill guidelines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=5430)|
| 1:30:34| I think it's a responsibility of every builder and developer to work with the neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=5434)|
| 1:30:39| whether it's Habitat or whether it's Joe Smith Homes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=5439)|
| 1:30:43| to make sure that what is being constructed is amenable to the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=5443)|
| 1:30:49| That brick house on the corner that you refer to as the doctor's house was built in the 70s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=5449)|
| 1:30:54| It clearly doesn't fit in this neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=5454)|
| 1:30:57| The house that was there, how seriously it was in poor repair,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=5457)|
| 1:31:03| how much could have been done to save it, I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=5463)|
| 1:31:06| I understand that people offered to buy this donated lot that you have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=5466)|
| 1:31:11| and that Habitat said, no, we don't sell lots, yet in other places Habitat has sold lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=5471)|
| 1:31:17| It strikes me that Habitat may have a cookie-cutter set of designs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=5477)|
| 1:31:23| and that we'll go in and put these on a lot and we hope they look okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=5483)|
| 1:31:28| This five-bedroom house and the design of it doesn't fit into this neighborhood at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=5488)|
| 1:31:35| I don't think that you would go into some other neighborhoods that have stringent guidelines| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=5495)|
| 1:31:42| and say, well, we're going to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=5502)|
| 1:31:44| I just don't think it would happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=5504)|
| 1:31:46| So I think that Habitat needs to consider looking at designs, looking at infill guidelines,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=5506)|
| 1:31:52| and Habitat also needs to be sure that the designs of the housing are appropriate for the neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=5512)|
| 1:31:59| placing of the door, placing of the windows, so that you don't get into this situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=5519)|
| 1:32:04| When someone puts in the 500 hours| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=5524)|
| 1:32:08| and determines that they're going to work with Habitat for a house,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=5528)|
| 1:32:11| they don't want a house that looks totally different from all the other houses in the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=5531)|
| 1:32:17| I've seen this happen in many neighborhoods where we've had grocery stores come in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=5537)|
| 1:32:21| and someone was well-intentioned and they got a bucket of money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=5541)|
| 1:32:25| and they came in and built a grocery store.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=5545)|
| 1:32:27| But in the eyes of the people in that neighborhood, that was the other grocery store| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=5547)|
| 1:32:31| because it wasn't a Kroger, it wasn't a Food City.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=5551)|
| 1:32:34| And I think that in this particular case, this family will,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=5554)|
| 1:32:40| I'm sure that the neighborhood will be accepting and fine,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=5560)|
| 1:32:44| but I think that this has not set forth a good welcoming to the neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=5564)|
| 1:32:50| and it's certainly not set a good image for Habitat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=5570)|
| 1:32:53| Habitat is a wonderful organization that has given thousands of people homes who would have never had them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=5573)|
| 1:32:59| But the same models and plans and thoughts that were used 20 or 30 years ago need to be updated in 2016.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=5579)|
| 1:33:07| So Oakwood-Lincoln Park, you need to get hopping on your conservation plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=5587)|
| 1:33:13| And Habitat for Humanity, you need to get modernized and thinking about working with neighborhoods,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=5593)|
| 1:33:20| not just coming in and plopping something down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=5600)|
| 1:33:22| Obviously, I'm going to be supporting this or I wouldn't have said all this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=5602)|
| 1:33:27| But I do think both sides, I think everybody has good intentions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=5607)|
| 1:33:32| Roads are paved with good intentions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=5612)|
| 1:33:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=5614)|
| 1:33:35| Roads to hell are paved with good intentions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=5615)|
| 1:33:41| Okay, any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=5621)|
| 1:33:44| So we have before us a motion to approve the appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=5624)|
| 1:33:50| All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=5630)|
| 1:33:53| The other option was to deny the appeal with a condition to change the roof.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=5633)|
| 1:33:58| I mean, I don't understand exactly how that works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=5638)|
| 1:34:02| Grant the appeal sends it back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=5642)|
| 1:34:05| To grant the neighborhood's appeal, I believe, Mr. Kelly, correct me if I'm wrong, Habitat for Humanity would begin again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=5645)|
| 1:34:14| No, that is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=5654)|
| 1:34:16| I'll have to go back to the NPO board and basically start over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=5656)|
| 1:34:19| If you deny the appeal, then Habitat can proceed forward with the most recent approved certificate of appropriateness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=5659)|
| 1:34:30| Is that correct again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=5670)|
| 1:34:31| If you deny without altering any of the conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=5671)|
| 1:34:34| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=5674)|
| 1:34:35| And then the third is to deny but put in conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=5675)|
| 1:34:41| And where does it go then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=5681)|
| 1:34:43| Well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=5683)|
| 1:34:44| Is it done?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=5684)|
| 1:34:45| Well, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=5685)|
| 1:34:46| Habitat can ultimately decide that they do not wish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=5686)|
| 1:34:48| That's not the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=5688)|
| 1:34:49| Do they have to go back to anyone or they can build that or not build at all?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=5689)|
| 1:34:52| Yeah, they do have to go back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=5692)|
| 1:34:54| I'll defer to Mr. Kelly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=5694)|
| 1:34:56| No, this is similar to the appeal, but you saw or hear anything else in the sense that once you place additional conditions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=5696)|
| 1:35:03| if they meet those conditions, they can proceed on into the building permit process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=5703)|
| 1:35:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=5707)|
| 1:35:08| You're basically modifying the certificate of appropriateness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=5708)|
| 1:35:09| Modifying the certificate of appropriateness, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=5709)|
| 1:35:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=5710)|
| 1:35:13| I'd ask Mr. Campin, do you prefer to simply deny it and send it back to the drawing board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=5713)|
| 1:35:18| or do you want to simply resolve the roof issue tonight and say build it or not, but here's the minimum?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=5718)|
| 1:35:25| Well, at this point, I mean, I'm in full support of the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=5725)|
| 1:35:31| I mean, the infill guidelines, if we're going to really adhere to them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=5731)|
| 1:35:34| and I think Councilman Steyer really pointed that out well, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=5734)|
| 1:35:38| if we look at the original designs of the homes on the block, we need to follow that and shoot for the stars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=5738)|
| 1:35:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=5744)|
| 1:35:45| So you're saying grant the appeal is what you're voting for?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=5745)|
| 1:35:48| Yes, yes, approve the appeal wholeheartedly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=5748)|
| 1:35:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=5750)|
| 1:35:53| Anybody else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=5753)|
| 1:35:55| No light there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=5755)|
| 1:35:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=5756)|
| 1:35:57| So the motion, again, is to approve the appeal of the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=5757)|
| 1:36:00| You ready to vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=5760)|
| 1:36:02| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=5762)|
| 1:36:03| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=5763)|
| 1:36:04| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=5764)|
| 1:36:06| One no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=5766)|
| 1:36:07| So that motion passes eight to one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=5767)|
| 1:36:11| Sorry?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=5771)|
| 1:36:12| Oh, it's gone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=5772)|
| 1:36:13| Seven to one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=5773)|
| 1:36:15| One is left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=5775)|
| 1:36:19| The vote passes seven to one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=5779)|
| 1:36:25| We move on to our third appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=5785)|
| 1:36:30| We're blessed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=5790)|
| 1:36:31| 10D is an appeal by Damon Falconier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=5791)|
| 1:36:34| The Board of Zoning Appeals' decision to deny a variance to decrease the minimum required floor elevation per submitted plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=5794)|
| 1:36:41| to permit the renovation of an existing building in a C6 district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=5801)|
| 1:36:45| property located at 2885 Tazel Pike, BZA file number 6-E-16-VA, 4th District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=5805)|
| 1:36:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=5818)|
| 1:36:59| Let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=5819)|
| 1:37:03| I don't have anybody signed up here one way or the other, but Mr. Falconier, thank you for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=5823)|
| 1:37:10| You have up to five minutes to present your case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=5830)|
| 1:37:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=5833)|
| 1:37:14| State your name and address for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=5834)|
| 1:37:15| Damon Falconier, 4622 Chambliss Avenue, Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=5835)|
| 1:37:20| I'd like to get a show of hands from the council members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=5840)|
| 1:37:24| How many of you know of the CC's Pizza Building on Broadway?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=5844)|
| 1:37:28| If you'll raise your hand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=5848)|
| 1:37:30| We usually don't ask questions when we're doing this, but go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=5850)|
| 1:37:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=5855)|
| 1:37:36| I saw a majority there who I see we have established that CC's Pizza is a type of landmark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=5856)|
| 1:37:44| And so what is a landmark?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=5864)|
| 1:37:46| Well, a landmark is a prominent identifying feature of a landscape or a fixed marker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=5866)|
| 1:37:53| If you've seen this derelict CC's Pizza Building, you would probably agree that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=5873)|
| 1:37:57| though it's a landmark, it's for the wrong reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=5877)|
| 1:38:01| McAllister's Deli hopes to transform this building into an impeccable restaurant, but it has face resistance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=5881)|
| 1:38:11| Our city of Knoxville engineering staff has overburdened my client and McAllister's Deli,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=5891)|
| 1:38:17| and they are limiting the potential for this property, and it is currently recognized by most people as unsuitable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=5897)|
| 1:38:25| This empty landmark of a building has been a blemish upon the face of our community for the last four years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=5905)|
| 1:38:34| But McAllister's Deli and the landlord are willing to invest nearly $1 million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=5914)|
| 1:38:39| to make this building attractive and productive again in this community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=5919)|
| 1:38:45| This existing building is located 425 feet away from First Creek| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=5925)|
| 1:38:51| and is currently expected to be flood-proofed to almost 4 feet above the finished floor for a 500-year flood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=5931)|
| 1:39:00| that has a 0.2% chance of occurrence in any given year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=5940)|
| 1:39:07| That's 0.2% chance in any given year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=5947)|
| 1:39:12| My client has been bound to a hardship imposed upon him in 2013.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=5952)|
| 1:39:21| With a new flood study that puts the building in both the 100-year flood and a 500-year flood zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=5961)|
| 1:39:30| If you ask city engineering staff, they would admit that there has been documented inaccuracies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=5970)|
| 1:39:37| that have been noted in these 2013 group of flood studies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=5977)|
| 1:39:43| The 2007 FEMA map and all the flood studies prior to 2013| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=5983)|
| 1:39:49| studies did not include the Cici's Pizza building in a 100-year flood or a 500-year flood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=5989)|
| 1:39:57| Though this Cici's Pizza building has been a blight on our community for the past four years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=5997)|
| 1:40:02| we can correct that tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=6002)|
| 1:40:05| McAllister's projects a $2 million per year revenue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=6005)|
| 1:40:09| is willing to invest nearly a million dollars to upgrade this building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=6009)|
| 1:40:13| increase the tax base, and provide jobs in our community in both construction work and operational employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=6013)|
| 1:40:20| This building is 425 feet away from First Creek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=6020)|
| 1:40:23| The owner is willing to flood-proof the existing building to 19 inches above the finished floor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=6023)|
| 1:40:29| which will meet all the requirements of a 100-year flood-proofing of the building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=6029)|
| 1:40:35| and, special note, a FEMA 100-year elevation certificate could be issued.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=6035)|
| 1:40:44| The City of Knoxville has been unfair by including the required building code upgrades based on the new building codes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=6044)|
| 1:40:52| which are including a new fire alarm system, a new sprinkler system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=6052)|
| 1:40:56| into the maximum permitted upgrade costs for the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=6056)|
| 1:41:01| Furthermore, the City of Knoxville staff has chosen to include incidental upgrades| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=6061)|
| 1:41:07| that are not specifically mentioned in the FEMA guidelines,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=6067)|
| 1:41:11| including $50,000 for the exterior building signage, decorative awnings, and building accent lighting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=6071)|
| 1:41:19| We feel that it's a reasonable request for the City Council to grant an exception| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=6079)|
| 1:41:25| to allow McAllister's Deli to upgrade this existing building to meet the standards for a 100-year FEMA flood zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=6085)|
| 1:41:32| without having to fulfill the requirements of a 500-year City of Knoxville imposed flood zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=6092)|
| 1:41:41| I spoke with Dr. Bruce Schantz, the regional hydrology engineer today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=6101)|
| 1:41:49| who is a well-respected expert, and he said that, quote, and I quote, he said you can quote me on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=6109)|
| 1:41:56| since this building is not blocking a flood, the building is an island, and not jeopardizing public safety,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=6116)|
| 1:42:03| the City Council should grant an exception for this location only.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=6123)|
| 1:42:07| This group of City Council members has the power to move this project forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=6127)|
| 1:42:11| for the three-month stalemate that has been engaged in with the City of Knoxville Engineering Department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=6131)|
| 1:42:16| and by doing so, you would right this injustice that has burdened my client.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=6136)|
| 1:42:21| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=6141)|
| 1:42:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=6142)|
| 1:42:23| Now we'll hear the respondent, Jim Hagerman, representing Engineering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=6143)|
| 1:42:27| Can I ask a question of this witness?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=6147)|
| 1:42:29| Sure, go right ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=6149)|
| 1:42:30| Am I correct in understanding you, Damon, that it was not even in the 100-year flood in the 2007 survey,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=6150)|
| 1:42:41| and the building is some 20 years old, and it's now this new survey is broadening the definition of what is to be flooded or not to be flooded?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=6161)|
| 1:42:49| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=6169)|
| 1:42:50| May I hand out the 2007 flood study?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=6170)|
| 1:42:52| Sure, you can just hand it up or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=6172)|
| 1:42:55| Yeah, sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=6175)|
| 1:42:56| They'll pass it around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=6176)|
| 1:43:05| While he's doing that, I would like to mention that Bruce Shantz is probably the leading hydrologist| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=6185)|
| 1:43:14| or at least flood and stormwater expert in the state of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=6194)|
| 1:43:19| He has drafted the guidelines for stormwater runoff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=6199)|
| 1:43:24| He has taught at University of Tennessee for dozens of years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=6204)|
| 1:43:29| and that he is the one that the state engineers look to for guidance on how you deal with both dams and flood zones| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=6209)|
| 1:43:38| and is a recognized expert in this community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=6218)|
| 1:43:44| And what does this picture you gave us show us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=6224)|
| 1:43:46| I'm not sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=6226)|
| 1:43:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=6227)|
| 1:43:48| Zone AE that you see in the darkened area, that is a 100-year flood zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=6228)|
| 1:43:54| The darker gray.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=6234)|
| 1:43:55| The darker gray.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=6235)|
| 1:43:57| Zone X is the 500-year flood zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=6237)|
| 1:44:00| Well, the site isn't in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=6240)|
| 1:44:02| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=6242)|
| 1:44:03| So what's?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=6243)|
| 1:44:04| That's the 2007 study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=6244)|
| 1:44:06| I see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=6246)|
| 1:44:07| Totally outside of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=6247)|
| 1:44:08| Totally outside of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=6248)|
| 1:44:09| So when it was built, it was legitimate to build it there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=6249)|
| 1:44:11| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=6251)|
| 1:44:12| And for, what, 15 or 20 years, it was still outside the flood zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=6252)|
| 1:44:16| Until 2013.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=6256)|
| 1:44:18| Until 2013.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=6258)|
| 1:44:20| And if a flood should come, would you then have to pick up the pizzas and take them outside of the building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=6260)|
| 1:44:24| or lift the sandwiches from McAllister?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=6264)|
| 1:44:26| I mean, what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=6266)|
| 1:44:27| There's no one living there, is there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=6267)|
| 1:44:28| No, not at all, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=6268)|
| 1:44:30| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=6270)|
| 1:44:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=6271)|
| 1:44:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=6273)|
| 1:44:34| Any other questions at this moment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=6274)|
| 1:44:36| Vice Mayor Grieve?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=6276)|
| 1:44:37| Do you have a copy of the latest?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=6277)|
| 1:44:40| I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=6280)|
| 1:44:41| Can we see that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=6281)|
| 1:44:47| While you're there, Mr. Falconer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=6287)|
| 1:44:48| Maybe while he's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=6288)|
| 1:44:49| Oh, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=6289)|
| 1:44:50| I just wanted to ask a quick question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=6290)|
| 1:44:51| Did you say that, and I'm sorry, Mark, over here to your left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=6291)|
| 1:44:56| Did you say that there were proven inaccuracies in the 13 report?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=6296)|
| 1:45:01| Is that true?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=6301)|
| 1:45:02| In 2013, there have been accuracies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=6302)|
| 1:45:04| If you would check with the City of Knoxville Engineering Department, there are proven inaccuracies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=6304)|
| 1:45:08| I even have one here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=6308)|
| 1:45:10| Well, direct to Jim then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=6310)|
| 1:45:12| Is that true?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=6312)|
| 1:45:13| Well, we.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=6313)|
| 1:45:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=6314)|
| 1:45:15| Well, Jim hasn't spoken yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=6315)|
| 1:45:16| Yeah, let Jim maybe make his statement, then you'll ask him questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=6316)|
| 1:45:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=6318)|
| 1:45:19| Did you finish, Vice Mayor Grieve?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=6319)|
| 1:45:20| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=6320)|
| 1:45:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=6321)|
| 1:45:22| Let's let Vice Mayor Grieve finish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=6322)|
| 1:45:23| I had another question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=6323)|
| 1:45:26| Are there possibilities, are there ways to appeal this, Damon?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=6326)|
| 1:45:32| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=6332)|
| 1:45:33| Beyond today?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=6333)|
| 1:45:34| Mm-hmm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=6334)|
| 1:45:35| I mean, is there a way that since the map was changed again, I mean, is there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=6335)|
| 1:45:40| Maybe this is a question that goes to Jim, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=6340)|
| 1:45:42| Maybe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=6342)|
| 1:45:43| Why don't we let Jim.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=6343)|
| 1:45:44| Let him make his presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=6344)|
| 1:45:45| Let me let Jim make his presentation and see if that answers any questions for you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=6345)|
| 1:45:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=6348)|
| 1:45:49| That's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=6349)|
| 1:45:50| Jim?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=6350)|
| 1:45:51| Jim Hagerman, Director of Engineering for the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=6351)|
| 1:45:52| You get up to five minutes, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=6352)|
| 1:45:56| Let me start with some background in the program and some of the rationale for how the program works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=6356)|
| 1:46:05| I'm sure you've all heard this before, but just so that we're all on the same page, some background is sometimes useful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=6365)|
| 1:46:12| Federal Emergency Management Agency provides insurance to property owners through the National Flood Insurance Program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=6372)|
| 1:46:21| Flood insurance provides resources for rebuilding communities when a flood occurs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=6381)|
| 1:46:27| If there is no flood insurance, there are no outside resources that come in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=6387)|
| 1:46:32| Non-participating communities do not get support to rebuild a community that's been flooded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=6392)|
| 1:46:40| The Flood Insurance Program is also structured to encourage communities to reduce the amount of rebuilding that would be required when that flood happens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=6400)|
| 1:46:51| One way to meet this goal of reducing the amount of rebuilding is to prevent significant investment in non-compliant, flood-prone structures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=6411)|
| 1:47:03| The basic FEMA requirements must be met in order for a community to participate in the Flood Insurance Program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=6423)|
| 1:47:12| but FEMA also has an additional program called the Community Rating System that provides an opportunity for communities to go beyond that minimum| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=6432)|
| 1:47:24| and get discounts on their insurance rates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=6444)|
| 1:47:29| The best rating is a 1. The basic minimum compliance is a 10.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=6449)|
| 1:47:39| We currently have an 8.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=6459)|
| 1:47:43| A better rating is attained through policies, regulations, and practices that go beyond the minimum that FEMA requires.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=6463)|
| 1:47:52| Along with those policies is consistent application of those policies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=6472)|
| 1:47:57| That's really important to maintaining your CRS score.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=6477)|
| 1:48:04| We're at an 8.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=6484)|
| 1:48:07| Commonly throughout the region and throughout the country, 7, 8, 9 is really frequent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=6487)|
| 1:48:15| At least that last survey of the area, there's nobody else in Tennessee that's better than an 8,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=6495)|
| 1:48:22| but we just recently got audited in April.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=6502)|
| 1:48:27| We hope that we scored high enough that we'll move up to a 7.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=6507)|
| 1:48:33| Regional peer cities are pretty similar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=6513)|
| 1:48:37| Nashville is also at an 8, trying to move to a 7.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=6517)|
| 1:48:41| Some of the other peer cities, however, are much stronger than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=6521)|
| 1:48:46| Louisville has a 5, and Charlotte's a 4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=6526)|
| 1:48:50| That's a much more rigorous flood control program than we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=6530)|
| 1:48:56| One of the ways we get a better score than a 10, moves us up to 9 and 8,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=6536)|
| 1:49:02| is regulating by the 500-year flood that 0.2% annual probability of flooding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=6542)|
| 1:49:11| rather than sticking with the minimum of the 100-year flood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=6551)|
| 1:49:16| One might make the point here that floods are not getting smaller.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=6556)|
| 1:49:21| Most of the climate experts are telling us that storm intensity is getting higher,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=6561)|
| 1:49:30| and they're predicting bigger flood events in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=6570)|
| 1:49:34| So even our 500-year flood is not necessarily that conservative over the long run.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=6574)|
| 1:49:44| The flood study map did change in 2013.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=6584)|
| 1:49:47| It got restudied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=6587)|
| 1:49:49| We are very confident in this particular...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=6589)|
| 1:49:51| You have one minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=6591)|
| 1:49:53| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=6593)|
| 1:49:54| We're very confident in this because a whole lot of extra work went into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=6594)|
| 1:49:57| We've done a lot of planning in the First Creek Basin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=6597)|
| 1:50:00| We've had consultants working with that model.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=6600)|
| 1:50:05| I have to correct one fact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=6605)|
| 1:50:10| The applicant mentioned the original CCs was built according to the 91 flood plain map| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=6610)|
| 1:50:18| and was in the flood plain in that previous map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=6618)|
| 1:50:25| This structure is not unique.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=6625)|
| 1:50:27| We have buildings in the First Creek Corridor in the same situation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=6627)|
| 1:50:30| and other buildings throughout the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=6630)|
| 1:50:33| One of the things that would risk our flood rating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=6633)|
| 1:50:37| and even our continued participation in the flood insurance program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=6637)|
| 1:50:43| is allowing a lot of variances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=6643)|
| 1:50:51| FEMA and city ordinance requires that any variance must be the minimum necessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=6651)|
| 1:50:58| This is just to the next notch conceptually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=6658)|
| 1:51:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=6664)|
| 1:51:05| So, Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=6665)|
| 1:51:08| Simple.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=6668)|
| 1:51:09| I have to recuse myself from one of my commercial agents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=6669)|
| 1:51:12| who represents McAllister in this deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=6672)|
| 1:51:13| So, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=6673)|
| 1:51:14| Did you eat the pizza in the past?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=6674)|
| 1:51:16| No, I'm not eating pizza.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=6676)|
| 1:51:20| Councilman Del Vecchio.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=6680)|
| 1:51:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=6681)|
| 1:51:22| Jim, I'm trying to understand where we are here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=6682)|
| 1:51:25| If this were an application for a brand new building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=6685)|
| 1:51:28| it would strike me that we would be wrong to approve it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=6688)|
| 1:51:33| if that's the definition of the flood zone we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=6693)|
| 1:51:37| But we've got a structure there that's been there since the 90s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=6697)|
| 1:51:42| Surely you don't have the power to make them tear it down, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=6702)|
| 1:51:44| The structure can be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=6704)|
| 1:51:47| The structure can be there if they don't invest more than 50% of the value.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=6707)|
| 1:51:52| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=6712)|
| 1:51:53| But as it is right now, it can stay there as a lump of concrete, basically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=6713)|
| 1:51:57| Or they could reopen a pizza joint as long as they didn't do a lot of investing in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=6717)|
| 1:52:02| But what we'd like not to happen is more investment in a building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=6722)|
| 1:52:07| that will be flooded in that big storm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=6727)|
| 1:52:10| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=6730)|
| 1:52:11| But is it correct that it was not in the path?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=6731)|
| 1:52:15| In other words, it's not like a new building that takes up space when you displace water.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=6735)|
| 1:52:21| So the building is there and water goes around it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=6741)|
| 1:52:24| but it doesn't block passage of the water so that it floods something else, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=6744)|
| 1:52:29| It's there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=6749)|
| 1:52:30| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=6750)|
| 1:52:31| It's there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=6751)|
| 1:52:32| Because it's there, it doesn't have any effect on its neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=6752)|
| 1:52:35| It's the flood insurance program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=6755)|
| 1:52:37| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=6757)|
| 1:52:38| It's more about the program and the rating and our qualification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=6758)|
| 1:52:41| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=6761)|
| 1:52:42| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=6762)|
| 1:52:43| And the 100-year flood is what they would look to at FEMA| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=6763)|
| 1:52:47| as to whether or not we meet some base requirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=6767)|
| 1:52:50| Yes, that's the base requirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=6770)|
| 1:52:52| If you want to get a 10, you can do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=6772)|
| 1:52:54| So you're shooting for a better number with the 500-year flood determination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=6774)|
| 1:52:58| But you still qualify as the 100-year flood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=6778)|
| 1:53:01| if they build up their floor that foot and a half or whatever this record says.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=6781)|
| 1:53:06| You'd make the minimum FEMA requirements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=6786)|
| 1:53:08| but you would not meet our ordinance requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=6788)|
| 1:53:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=6791)|
| 1:53:12| Well, I guess the question is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=6792)|
| 1:53:13| are we here on some kind of variance to the ordinance requirement or not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=6793)|
| 1:53:16| My other question is, are we legally prohibited from approving a change,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=6796)|
| 1:53:22| or is that simply a voluntary action?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=6802)|
| 1:53:25| Maybe that's for Mr. Swanson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=6805)|
| 1:53:27| In other words, do we have to do the 500-year flood thing here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=6807)|
| 1:53:30| or do we have some discretion to look at the particular facts of this case?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=6810)|
| 1:53:34| Well, we've adopted what we've adopted, and we have to go by what we've adopted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=6814)|
| 1:53:38| I mean, we set our rules, and that's what our rules are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=6818)|
| 1:53:41| and we're obligated to go by those and not just make exceptions to them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=6821)|
| 1:53:45| unless you've got a legal basis for a variance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=6825)|
| 1:53:48| I have yet to hear the legal basis under our code for the variance here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=6828)|
| 1:53:54| Okay, but if you find a basis, then you're allowed to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=6834)|
| 1:53:58| Jim says it's not desirable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=6838)|
| 1:54:00| because you're one step closer to not being a better flood complier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=6840)|
| 1:54:07| Well, I think what he says is it jeopardizes for everyone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=6847)|
| 1:54:11| the availability of FEMA flood insurance, if that's what you do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=6851)|
| 1:54:15| and you would be risking that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=6855)|
| 1:54:18| No, I thought he meant the 100-year flood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=6858)|
| 1:54:20| You were still okay under the FEMA guidelines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=6860)|
| 1:54:24| I may have misunderstood him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=6864)|
| 1:54:26| If you want to change the ordinance to change us to a 100-year flood community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=6866)|
| 1:54:35| that, I guess, is a solution, but that gets us higher insurance rates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=6875)|
| 1:54:43| that it would be easier to comply with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=6883)|
| 1:54:47| I'm confused.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=6887)|
| 1:54:48| I thought you said that FEMA based its base program on the 100-year flood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=6888)|
| 1:54:52| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=6892)|
| 1:54:54| We go beyond it by going to the 500-year flood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=6894)|
| 1:54:57| So in order for what I understand you're saying to happen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=6897)|
| 1:55:05| we'd have to change the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=6905)|
| 1:55:06| Did that happen in 2013, the ordinance change?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=6906)|
| 1:55:09| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=6909)|
| 1:55:10| When did it happen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=6910)|
| 1:55:12| It was before that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=6912)|
| 1:55:16| It was sometime in the 90s we went to the 500-year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=6916)|
| 1:55:20| Before the building was built or after?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=6920)|
| 1:55:22| Before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=6922)|
| 1:55:24| Before this building was built.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=6924)|
| 1:55:25| It was built in 1996.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=6925)|
| 1:55:27| How did they get a permit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=6927)|
| 1:55:29| They certified their floor elevation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=6929)|
| 1:55:31| Are you confusing floodway and floodplain?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=6931)|
| 1:55:35| I don't know the difference, I'm sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=6935)|
| 1:55:37| Floodway is the area that's immediately adjacent to the stream.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=6937)|
| 1:55:42| The actual stream itself?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=6942)|
| 1:55:43| Yeah, which you cannot build in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=6943)|
| 1:55:45| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=6945)|
| 1:55:46| And he's got some 400 feet from that, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=6946)|
| 1:55:48| Yeah, he's in the floodplain,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=6948)|
| 1:55:50| which means that the floor elevation is regulated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=6950)|
| 1:55:53| As long as he's a foot above,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=6953)|
| 1:55:55| the habitable space is a foot above the elevation of that regulatory flood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=6955)|
| 1:56:03| he can pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=6963)|
| 1:56:06| And if I understand their position,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=6966)|
| 1:56:08| they want to build 1 foot or 1.2 feet higher than the elevation to meet that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=6968)|
| 1:56:14| 100-year standard, but not the 500 because the cost becomes prohibitive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=6974)|
| 1:56:19| or the ceilings are too low or the building has to be torn down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=6979)|
| 1:56:22| or some other horror.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=6982)|
| 1:56:24| Is that fair?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=6984)|
| 1:56:26| If we want to protect our community to the 500-year flood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=6986)|
| 1:56:29| then this is not protected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=6989)|
| 1:56:35| We're not displacing water on someone else's property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=6995)|
| 1:56:39| but we're playing with the insurance rating game| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=6999)|
| 1:56:42| in terms of trying to improve our posture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=7002)|
| 1:56:44| And protecting the public from investing in putting their money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=7004)|
| 1:56:51| endangering the people that are in the restaurant potentially| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=7011)|
| 1:56:56| during a flash flood kind of event| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=7016)|
| 1:57:00| and investing money in a flood-prone location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=7020)|
| 1:57:07| But if they invest 49% of the building's value,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=7027)|
| 1:57:11| you have no say in what they do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=7031)|
| 1:57:13| It's only when they trigger the 51% that you...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=7033)|
| 1:57:16| If they invest 49% in it, they can do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=7036)|
| 1:57:21| but the 50% is over the life of the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=7041)|
| 1:57:24| So if they invest 49%,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=7044)|
| 1:57:26| they would have a hard time putting a roof on when the time came.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=7046)|
| 1:57:31| You mean just repairing the roof?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=7051)|
| 1:57:32| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=7052)|
| 1:57:33| Any further investment in the building would put them over 50%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=7053)|
| 1:57:38| So they just walk away from their million-dollar building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=7058)|
| 1:57:40| or their $900,000 building?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=7060)|
| 1:57:42| Which is why it's not a good idea to invest in the first place in this sort of case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=7062)|
| 1:57:47| So, I mean, it makes sense to invest considerably less| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=7067)|
| 1:57:51| or enough to really fix the issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=7071)|
| 1:57:56| Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=7076)|
| 1:57:58| Okay. We can go to the other council members, but we also still...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=7078)|
| 1:58:01| Mr. Falconier gets a two-minute rebuttal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=7081)|
| 1:58:03| Do you want to hear that first or do you want to ask your question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=7083)|
| 1:58:07| Okay. Mr. Falconier, two minutes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=7087)|
| 1:58:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=7090)|
| 1:58:11| You have before you asked for copies of the current map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=7091)|
| 1:58:14| I've colored it to make it easier to understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=7094)|
| 1:58:17| The green is the 500-year flood that you see, the green line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=7097)|
| 1:58:21| The red line is the 100-year flood, and you see where the building is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=7101)|
| 1:58:27| Someone said, well, could people get out of the restaurant?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=7107)|
| 1:58:32| I'm going to help it be clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=7112)|
| 1:58:34| The building is 425 feet away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=7114)|
| 1:58:36| That means the water would have to rise 14 1⁄2 feet before it got to the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=7116)|
| 1:58:43| It has to rise 15 feet to get to the 100-year flood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=7123)|
| 1:58:48| and 17 feet to get to the green.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=7128)|
| 1:58:51| I do believe we have enough common-sense people in North Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=7131)|
| 1:58:55| to get out of the building before it gets 14 feet deep,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=7135)|
| 1:58:57| so I don't think we have to worry about safety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=7137)|
| 1:58:59| Get your sandwich to go, is that what you're saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=7139)|
| 1:59:01| Get your sandwich to go, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=7141)|
| 1:59:04| Then it was also said that do I have a right for this appeal?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=7144)|
| 1:59:08| Yes, we have a right for this appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=7148)|
| 1:59:09| We have a hardship.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=7149)|
| 1:59:10| We have a building we can't use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=7150)|
| 1:59:12| We came to the BZA board, so yes, I do have a right to appeal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=7152)|
| 1:59:16| and the owner does have a hardship.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=7156)|
| 1:59:18| The other question I'd like to speak on and be able to hand only one copy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=7158)|
| 1:59:23| is I have an elevation certificate for the three-minute car wash.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=7163)|
| 1:59:29| You've got about 40 seconds here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=7169)|
| 1:59:31| In that three-minute car wash elevation certificate, Director,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=7171)|
| 1:59:36| I have an elevation certificate showing what the elevation of the car wash is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=7176)|
| 1:59:43| There is no indication on this study that the car wash is correct in the 100-year flood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=7183)|
| 1:59:52| If you'll look and see the map, the car wash is not shown| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=7192)|
| 1:59:56| as it was raised up when it was built, and it would be an island,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=7196)|
| 2:00:01| and so the flood study did not recognize that that car wash was not in the 100-year flood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=7201)|
| 2:00:08| I just want to make that clear that I can bring you a deficiency in the study tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=7208)|
| 2:00:13| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=7213)|
| 2:00:14| That's your two minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=7214)|
| 2:00:16| Okay, Councilman Saunders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=7216)|
| 2:00:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=7218)|
| 2:00:19| Jim, there is a new restaurant that is about to open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=7219)|
| 2:00:24| We approved this evening a beer permit for a restaurant down on Sutherland Avenue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=7224)|
| 2:00:30| which has some similarity to this, where they tore down an old building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=7230)|
| 2:00:35| and it's in a floodplain obviously, and they built a new building up essentially on a pedestal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=7235)|
| 2:00:42| What's the relationship?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=7242)|
| 2:00:43| How does that square with what we're being asked here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=7243)|
| 2:00:47| You know which one I'm talking about?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=7247)|
| 2:00:50| I can guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=7250)|
| 2:00:52| It's down near Third Creek just east of the trucking company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=7252)|
| 2:00:56| That's the way to get your fore height at a legal elevation is to build it up one way or another,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=7256)|
| 2:01:04| either with fill or with structure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=7264)|
| 2:01:13| Yeah, there was a building there, and it's going to be a restaurant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=7273)|
| 2:01:16| which many of my colleagues have expressed interest in going to for their hot chicken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=7276)|
| 2:01:23| There still is a restaurant there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=7283)|
| 2:01:25| There is now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=7285)|
| 2:01:26| It hasn't opened yet, but they tore down the old building, the old structure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=7286)|
| 2:01:30| and literally built a pedestal and built a building on top of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=7290)|
| 2:01:33| Okay, well, so it probably has a high enough floor elevation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=7293)|
| 2:01:36| Well, my point is how can we consider basically a variance for this when, in fact,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=7296)|
| 2:01:43| and I don't know what led up to that whole transaction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=7303)|
| 2:01:48| when, in fact, this has occurred in other areas where they have made that accommodation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=7308)|
| 2:01:54| Somebody did, and I don't know whether you knew the transaction, what happened or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=7314)|
| 2:02:05| Yeah, well, and that's really what we're after here is for them to either, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=7325)|
| 2:02:10| I don't want to ask anybody to demolish a building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=7330)|
| 2:02:13| but to find some way to get that floor elevation up to a legal elevation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=7333)|
| 2:02:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=7338)|
| 2:02:23| Vice Mayor Grave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=7343)|
| 2:02:25| Was that same situation down at North Shore and Kingston Pike where they tore down the bank| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=7345)|
| 2:02:29| and had razed the building?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=7349)|
| 2:02:33| That's the same situation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=7353)|
| 2:02:34| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=7354)|
| 2:02:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=7355)|
| 2:02:36| And then on up Broadway where the McDonald's, and they just built one of those financial institutions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=7356)|
| 2:02:43| next to the McDonald's, and they razed that building, that site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=7363)|
| 2:02:48| One of those alternative financial institutions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=7368)|
| 2:02:50| Alternative financial services, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=7370)|
| 2:02:52| But the McDonald's, from what I understand, they have like a floodgate on the entrance to their building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=7372)|
| 2:02:57| Yeah, that's what has been referred to as flood proofing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=7377)|
| 2:03:04| As I understand it, if I remember right, it basically, as the water comes in, it floats,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=7384)|
| 2:03:10| and it seals off the inside of the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=7390)|
| 2:03:13| And in that particular location, at the particular time they did this work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=7393)|
| 2:03:19| that was enough to get it protected to the elevation that they needed to protect it to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=7399)|
| 2:03:25| And I don't know what date that was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=7405)|
| 2:03:28| It probably was the 2007 map that they were working off of rather than the 2013 map,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=7408)|
| 2:03:33| which was a little different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=7413)|
| 2:03:37| So they're talking about a floodgate also, right, Damon?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=7417)|
| 2:03:43| In your packet, you'll see the flood doors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=7423)|
| 2:03:45| Flood doors, right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=7425)|
| 2:03:46| The flood doors themselves are designed to hold back the water.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=7426)|
| 2:03:51| Okay, but that's only to the 100-year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=7431)|
| 2:03:53| We have specified to the 100-year because it's an old masonry building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=7433)|
| 2:03:59| suspected unreinforced, and an unreinforced masonry building would be suspect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=7439)|
| 2:04:04| without a lot of engineering to determine if it would actually hold four feet of water,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=7444)|
| 2:04:08| as you can imagine, would be huge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=7448)|
| 2:04:11| So we're trying to appeal to realistic logic here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=7451)|
| 2:04:16| We have an existing building we would just like to reuse| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=7456)|
| 2:04:19| and benefit the community with jobs and people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=7459)|
| 2:04:24| Have you done a study in terms of like in some of these other places| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=7464)|
| 2:04:28| where you just tear the building down and build a new one as opposed to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=7468)|
| 2:04:32| because you're spending quite a bit of money, what, $900,000 or so?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=7472)|
| 2:04:35| Well, keep in mind most of it's being spent by the tenants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=7475)|
| 2:04:38| Developers doing some of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=7478)|
| 2:04:40| Developers doing all the flood proofing of the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=7480)|
| 2:04:43| So developers picking up that tab, but the tenants doing the rest of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=7483)|
| 2:04:46| And they want to be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=7486)|
| 2:04:48| They want to be here so bad they've been waiting for three months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=7488)|
| 2:04:53| They want to be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=7493)|
| 2:04:54| They want to be in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=7494)|
| 2:04:55| They want to be in North Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=7495)|
| 2:04:57| They want to cater to that group of people there, but they're not able to yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=7497)|
| 2:05:01| We've been stalemated because of this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=7501)|
| 2:05:04| We think it's a very reasonable request to do a 100-year flood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=7504)|
| 2:05:07| We'll get a flood certificate from FEMA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=7507)|
| 2:05:11| It'll be issued.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=7511)|
| 2:05:12| Everything will be good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=7512)|
| 2:05:15| Jim, is there any process?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=7515)|
| 2:05:20| I mean, besides city council deciding what to do in this situation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=7520)|
| 2:05:23| is there a process that you can go through where you relook at the boundaries| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=7523)|
| 2:05:29| of what you have set up in this situation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=7529)|
| 2:05:32| I mean, hasn't that happened?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=7532)|
| 2:05:33| Yes, and thanks for asking because I didn't get to answer that question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=7533)|
| 2:05:35| I ran out of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=7535)|
| 2:05:36| I talked too much before, so I didn't get to answer that question before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=7536)|
| 2:05:40| Yes, there is a process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=7540)|
| 2:05:42| If you are convinced that there is an error in the map,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=7542)|
| 2:05:45| you can appeal straight to FEMA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=7545)|
| 2:05:49| You have to hire an engineer to do the hydraulics,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=7549)|
| 2:05:53| but if there is an error that you feel needs to be corrected that you would benefit from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=7553)|
| 2:06:01| Has this happened?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=7561)|
| 2:06:02| It has happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=7562)|
| 2:06:03| It has happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=7563)|
| 2:06:04| And we have had in other parts of the city, we have seen some errors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=7564)|
| 2:06:08| and at least one we helped correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=7568)|
| 2:06:12| Well, the developer paid for it, but we sort of guided them through the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=7572)|
| 2:06:17| But it was much more clearly an error, and as I said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=7577)|
| 2:06:23| we have a lot more confidence in the First Creek part of this flood study| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=7583)|
| 2:06:28| than we do in the rest of the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=7588)|
| 2:06:29| But that is an option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=7589)|
| 2:06:30| It is an option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=7590)|
| 2:06:31| The city could help this individual in terms of looking at what the boundary is right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=7591)|
| 2:06:35| in terms of whether it could be moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=7595)|
| 2:06:37| Yeah, we could steer them through the process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=7597)|
| 2:06:39| but some of the local engineers know at least as much about it as we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=7599)|
| 2:06:46| Is that a lengthy process?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=7606)|
| 2:06:48| It takes money and time, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=7608)|
| 2:06:52| Several months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=7612)|
| 2:06:56| Is that an option, David?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=7616)|
| 2:06:59| I don't know how much longer McAllister's will wait, honestly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=7619)|
| 2:07:02| I would not think they would wait more months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=7622)|
| 2:07:05| The contractor has already been hired.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=7625)|
| 2:07:07| There's already a contract in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=7627)|
| 2:07:10| Materials have been, you know, pictures have been bought,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=7630)|
| 2:07:13| and they're just waiting on this body to be able to understand the situation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=7633)|
| 2:07:22| and be able to vote affirmatively.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=7642)|
| 2:07:30| Is there any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=7650)|
| 2:07:32| I guess I just have one question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=7652)|
| 2:07:34| If we vote in favor of the client in this situation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=7654)|
| 2:07:40| we're going against what the city is really saying in terms of what's happening| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=7660)|
| 2:07:43| with the insurance rates, correct, Counselor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=7663)|
| 2:07:48| Yes, you would be doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=7668)|
| 2:07:53| He has stated that his hardship here is that they changed the level of the floodplain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=7673)|
| 2:08:02| That's what he said his hardship was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=7682)|
| 2:08:04| But under our standards for granting variances,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=7684)|
| 2:08:08| that's not a hardship that will allow you to grant a variance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=7688)|
| 2:08:13| And it also says that variances shall not be granted to allow a use otherwise excluded| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=7693)|
| 2:08:20| from the particular district in which it is requested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=7700)|
| 2:08:25| You can't build on a floodplain below the level of the floodplain listed there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=7705)|
| 2:08:34| And so this would be in violation of Section 2 of the Standards for Variances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=7714)|
| 2:08:40| in Article 7 of the Zoning Ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=7720)|
| 2:08:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=7726)|
| 2:08:49| Quick question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=7729)|
| 2:08:52| Damon, can your client customer live with a $400,000 fix to the building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=7732)|
| 2:08:59| as opposed to something that goes whole hog here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=7739)|
| 2:09:03| Not based on the way our City of Knoxville Engineering Department is categorizing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=7743)|
| 2:09:11| the items in the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=7751)|
| 2:09:17| For instance, we can only spend $473,000 on the building, period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=7757)|
| 2:09:23| And so we put together an exhaustive list of whether the stove plugs in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=7763)|
| 2:09:28| whether the cooler was disconnectable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=7768)|
| 2:09:34| and it was a very subjective review of our list,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=7774)|
| 2:09:38| and they chose which one they thought fit in the FEMA guidelines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=7778)|
| 2:09:43| They said the $50,000 worth of exterior signage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=7783)|
| 2:09:46| and decorative awnings and exterior lighting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=7786)|
| 2:09:49| it does not say that in the FEMA guidelines, has to be included.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=7789)|
| 2:09:53| Well, they chose to include it because they erred on the conservative side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=7793)|
| 2:09:56| So if you ask, do I think I can be in the $400,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=7796)|
| 2:09:59| I don't think there's a chance I can put a bookstore in there for $400,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=7799)|
| 2:10:04| Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=7804)|
| 2:10:06| Okay, so at this point we do not have a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=7806)|
| 2:10:12| Somebody make some sort of motion, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=7812)|
| 2:10:14| We need a motion to approve his appeal or to deny his appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=7814)|
| 2:10:19| I'll make a motion to approve the appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=7819)|
| 2:10:21| We've had the discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=7821)|
| 2:10:22| I guess we'll just see how it turns out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=7822)|
| 2:10:24| I'll second that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=7824)|
| 2:10:27| There's a motion and a second to approve the appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=7827)|
| 2:10:30| Any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=7830)|
| 2:10:33| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=7833)|
| 2:10:34| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=7834)|
| 2:10:36| Let's do a roll call on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=7836)|
| 2:10:38| I think we know what came out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=7838)|
| 2:10:41| Your hearing is acute enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=7841)|
| 2:10:42| I want to know, okay, who said aye?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=7842)|
| 2:10:45| Just raise your hand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=7845)|
| 2:10:46| Two people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=7846)|
| 2:10:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=7847)|
| 2:10:48| And we have one recused, so all in favor say no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=7848)|
| 2:10:54| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=7854)|
| 2:10:55| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=7855)|
| 2:10:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=7856)|
| 2:10:57| So the appeal fails seven or six.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=7857)|
| 2:10:59| Oh, wait a minute, we've got one missing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=7859)|
| 2:11:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=7861)|
| 2:11:02| Six to two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=7862)|
| 2:11:04| Correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=7864)|
| 2:11:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=7865)|
| 2:11:08| Fails six to two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=7868)|
| 2:11:10| Very interesting discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=7870)|
| 2:11:15| Two in favor of it, five opposed to it, and one abstaining.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=7875)|
| 2:11:21| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=7881)|
| 2:11:22| And one absent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=7882)|
| 2:11:23| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=7883)|
| 2:11:24| Do you have that, Mr. Recorder?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=7884)|
| 2:11:26| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=7886)|
| 2:11:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=7887)|
| 2:11:28| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=7888)|
| 2:11:29| It takes a village here sometimes, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=7889)|
| 2:11:31| What was the result?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=7891)|
| 2:11:33| The result was two in favor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=7893)|
| 2:11:40| Five against the appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=7900)|
| 2:11:43| One recused, and then one was absent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=7903)|
| 2:12:03| Mr. Law Director, do we need another motion at this point since the motion to approve failed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=7923)|
| 2:12:08| Well, just to be abundantly safe, after the decision from the court that said we needed a motion to deny,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=7928)|
| 2:12:17| now that the motion to approve has failed, it would probably be wise to ask for a motion to deny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=7937)|
| 2:12:23| Motion to deny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=7943)|
| 2:12:24| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=7944)|
| 2:12:25| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=7945)|
| 2:12:26| We have a motion and a second to deny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=7946)|
| 2:12:28| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=7948)|
| 2:12:30| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=7950)|
| 2:12:31| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=7951)|
| 2:12:32| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=7952)|
| 2:12:33| Again, it's an accused.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=7953)|
| 2:12:36| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=7956)|
| 2:12:37| Five to deny, two opposed, and one recused.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=7957)|
| 2:12:42| Got that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=7962)|
| 2:12:43| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=7963)|
| 2:12:44| Mr. Johnson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=7964)|
| 2:12:45| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=7965)|
| 2:12:46| 11A is a resolution authorizing the mayor to enter into a support and cooperation agreement with Knoxville's Community Development Corporation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=7966)|
| 2:12:53| to provide administrative and technical assistance as well as financial contributions to enable KCDC to perform its duties under the development agreement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=7973)|
| 2:13:01| and other project documents with which KCDC is entering into with Riverwalk Investors, LLC, and Grand Oak, LLC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=7981)|
| 2:13:10| with respect to the redevelopment of certain property formerly known as the Baptist Hospital site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=7990)|
| 2:13:15| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=7995)|
| 2:13:16| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=7996)|
| 2:13:17| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=7997)|
| 2:13:18| I want to call on Christy Branskin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=7998)|
| 2:13:20| She promised.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=8000)|
| 2:13:21| That's what I was going to do, too, so go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=8001)|
| 2:13:23| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=8003)|
| 2:13:24| Well, we'll both call on our COO, Deputy to the Mayor, to give us an overview on these next two items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=8004)|
| 2:13:30| Great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=8010)|
| 2:13:31| I feel popular.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=8011)|
| 2:13:32| Christy Branskin, Chief Operating Officer, Deputy to the Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=8012)|
| 2:13:35| I know this is a long council night, but I do need to give you guys an update on where we are, so hang in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=8015)|
| 2:13:43| We're going to be updating you about the move of Regal Cinema's corporate headquarters to our city's downtown on the south waterfront.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=8023)|
| 2:13:48| We've all worked very hard over the last several months, and I'm excited to report our project documents are in final form,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=8028)|
| 2:13:55| save a couple of little minor tweaks here and there, but they're ready for execution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=8035)|
| 2:13:59| There's a lot of people who played a role in this along the way, and we believe we've structured a deal that can work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=8039)|
| 2:14:04| I especially want to thank Mark Mamentoff and both he and Allison Dyer for their help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=8044)|
| 2:14:09| Allison is here this evening, and she's an attorney for the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=8049)|
| 2:14:13| I hate to read this, but I am going to kind of read this because there are a lot of details,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=8053)|
| 2:14:18| and I just want to make sure I don't forget anything that's important for you guys to know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=8058)|
| 2:14:22| So we'll start with a brief background because it's been a few months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=8062)|
| 2:14:26| On October 15, 2015, the city and Regal Cinemas, with the help of KCDC and IDB,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=8066)|
| 2:14:31| entered into a letter of intent committing each party to working on the redevelopment of a site| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=8071)|
| 2:14:37| in an area previously known as Baptist Hospital of East Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=8077)|
| 2:14:41| The objective of this work has been to lease the property at 101 East Blount Avenue to Regal Cinemas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=8081)|
| 2:14:46| as a corporate headquarters with the intent of promoting high-quality employment in the downtown area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=8086)|
| 2:14:51| and assisting with the overall redevelopment of the Baptist Hospital site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=8091)|
| 2:14:55| CETA had purchased the full 23-acre site from Tenova, which was Baptist Hospital's successor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=8095)|
| 2:15:00| and they did that in 2013, to redevelop the site as a mixed-use development of luxury apartments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=8100)|
| 2:15:06| student housing, hotel, retail shopping, and restaurants and public spaces,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=8106)|
| 2:15:10| including a riverwalk, a park, and an entertainment plaza.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=8110)|
| 2:15:14| A TIF district was established to support CETA's project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=8114)|
| 2:15:18| The building that we're talking about is located at the corner of Gay Street and Blount Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=8118)|
| 2:15:23| It's nine stories and 178,000 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=8123)|
| 2:15:26| The building is 26 years old, and it's been vacant since 2008, so several years now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=8126)|
| 2:15:31| and as you can imagine, it needs a lot of work for it to function appropriately for Regal's needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=8131)|
| 2:15:36| The basic concept of the deal is this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=8136)|
| 2:15:38| IDB will purchase this nine-story building from Southeastern Development Associates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=8138)|
| 2:15:43| You guys may recall that Southeastern Development Associates, also known as CETA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=8143)|
| 2:15:47| is the successor organization to Blanchard Calhoun.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=8147)|
| 2:15:51| This means that the building will be removed from the south waterfront TIF district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=8151)|
| 2:15:56| The IDB will then lease the building to Regal Cinemas on a triple-net basis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=8156)|
| 2:16:00| which means Regal will be responsible for all taxes, insurance, maintenance, utilities, everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=8160)|
| 2:16:06| The building will be renovated by Regal at their cost with some tenant improvement contributions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=8166)|
| 2:16:10| coming from CETA, the city of Knoxville, Knox County, and the state of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=8170)|
| 2:16:16| TVA will contribute also with a utility asset improvement grant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=8176)|
| 2:16:20| Funds have been transferred from the city to the IDB.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=8180)|
| 2:16:23| The county has allocated their funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=8183)|
| 2:16:25| CETA's contribution will be made pursuant to the terms of a purchase and sell agreement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=8185)|
| 2:16:30| and the state's grant money will be distributed pursuant to a reimbursement plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=8190)|
| 2:16:35| Again, these funds will be used by the IDB to purchase the building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=8195)|
| 2:16:38| and for contributions towards some of the tenant improvement work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=8198)|
| 2:16:42| The initial lease term is 10 years with two successive option terms of 10 years each.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=8202)|
| 2:16:47| As long as the lease is in effect, Regal shall have the option to purchase the building for $9 million,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=8207)|
| 2:16:52| and such purchase would provide for either a full or some portion of a return to the city of the city's investment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=8212)|
| 2:16:59| This purchase price will be reduced by $300,000 for each full rent year completed by Regal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=8219)|
| 2:17:06| During the term of the lease agreement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=8226)|
| 2:17:08| Regal will make a pilot payment equal to the full amount of annual taxes assessed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=8228)|
| 2:17:12| on the appraised full post-redevelopment value of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=8232)|
| 2:17:16| And for the first 10 years of the lease, this payment will act as rent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=8236)|
| 2:17:20| Now, what Regal Sinemas is obligated to do is to locate its corporate headquarters at this building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=8240)|
| 2:17:25| and to maintain no less than 275 full-time employees throughout the lease term| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=8245)|
| 2:17:30| and as that term may be extended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=8250)|
| 2:17:33| For the first 10-year term, again, the rent will be in the form of the full amount of property taxes assessed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=8253)|
| 2:17:37| on the appraised full post-redevelopment value of the property pursuant to the pilot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=8257)|
| 2:17:43| Should Regal default in its obligation to maintain 275 employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=8263)|
| 2:17:47| or fail to operate the property as a corporate headquarters at any point during the lease,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=8267)|
| 2:17:52| it will be required to pay adjusted rent in the amount of $10 per square foot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=8272)|
| 2:17:56| until the expiration of the 10th lease year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=8276)|
| 2:17:59| and thereafter pay $11 per square foot for years 11 through 20| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=8279)|
| 2:18:03| and $12 per square foot for years 21 through 30 should the lease be extended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=8283)|
| 2:18:08| And, of course, this rent amount will be in addition to the property taxes that will remain due.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=8288)|
| 2:18:13| Should Regal not purchase the building during the initial 10-year term| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=8293)|
| 2:18:16| but decide to extend its lease term and it still is maintaining with the 275| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=8296)|
| 2:18:21| and using it as a corporate headquarters,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=8301)|
| 2:18:23| the rent in the amount of $178,000 per year shall be payable to IDB,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=8303)|
| 2:18:27| and that's a dollar a square foot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=8307)|
| 2:18:29| Should Regal extend the term for the second extension period rent in the amount of $356,000 per year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=8309)|
| 2:18:35| shall be payable, and that's $2 per square foot, and that will be the end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=8315)|
| 2:18:40| So keep in mind the taxes will remain payable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=8320)|
| 2:18:42| and the obligation to use the building as a corporate headquarters| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=8322)|
| 2:18:45| and employ no less than 275 persons shall remain throughout that entire term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=8325)|
| 2:18:50| So let me give you an update on what has changed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=8330)|
| 2:18:53| since we talked about the original concept of this deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=8333)|
| 2:18:56| Originally, we had planned for the garage ownership to be divided among the three parties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=8336)|
| 2:19:01| The City of Knoxville, CETA, and Regal had agreed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=8341)|
| 2:19:04| that the best way to own the garage would be under condominium regime.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=8344)|
| 2:19:08| After attempting to work through the details of this option,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=8348)|
| 2:19:10| the condo concept became very complicated, and the parties could not get comfortable with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=8350)|
| 2:19:15| So we had to punt and rethink, and this is what we agreed to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=8355)|
| 2:19:19| It was determined that the ownership of the garage, the surface parking areas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=8359)|
| 2:19:23| and the pedestrian connection from the garage to the building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=8363)|
| 2:19:26| should be transferred to the IDB along with the office building at no additional cost,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=8366)|
| 2:19:31| but as part of the original $6 million purchase price.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=8371)|
| 2:19:35| This type structure will allow for some amount of public parking during the day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=8375)|
| 2:19:39| for future tenants on the street level,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=8379)|
| 2:19:41| and if you recall from the redevelopment plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=8381)|
| 2:19:43| the street level is planned to include restaurants and retail operations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=8383)|
| 2:19:47| And then more public parking will be made available in the evenings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=8387)|
| 2:19:50| and on the weekends and holidays.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=8390)|
| 2:19:52| As part of the south waterfront development, there will be quite a few public spaces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=8392)|
| 2:19:55| In addition to the riverwalks, we want to make sure that users of these amenities have a place to park| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=8395)|
| 2:20:00| should they choose to drive to the south waterfront.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=8400)|
| 2:20:03| Due to significant investment occurring in this area of our city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=8403)|
| 2:20:06| and the planned additional redevelopment, we believe the owning of the garage is a good investment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=8406)|
| 2:20:11| I think we know and we've even seen that there's going to continue to be future growth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=8411)|
| 2:20:14| south of the river in our downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=8414)|
| 2:20:16| We understand the parking needs in our downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=8416)|
| 2:20:18| We just finished adding a level to the State Street Garage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=8418)|
| 2:20:21| I think we've all been internally discussing when it may be time to add another level or two to the State Street Garage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=8421)|
| 2:20:27| Although the city will own the garage, the cost of operating and maintaining the garage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=8427)|
| 2:20:31| will be shared among the three parties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=8431)|
| 2:20:34| Since Regal is using the garage and surface spaces during the day only,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=8434)|
| 2:20:38| they will be paying $180 per year per parking space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=8438)|
| 2:20:42| CETA will, of course, need 24-hour access to their garage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=8442)|
| 2:20:45| because they're developing multifamily housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=8445)|
| 2:20:49| The city's objective, as I mentioned, is to provide public parking during the day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=8449)|
| 2:20:53| and then more in the evening, weekends, and holidays.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=8453)|
| 2:20:56| Therefore, CETA and the city will share the remaining costs evenly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=8456)|
| 2:21:01| With this change, of course, it was important for all of us to have detailed understanding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=8461)|
| 2:21:04| of the garage conditions and the functionality of that and the surface parking area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=8464)|
| 2:21:09| The city and CETA shared in the cost of a parking consultant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=8469)|
| 2:21:12| who advised on what adjustments were necessary to improve the functionality of the garage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=8472)|
| 2:21:17| Additionally, several deferred maintenance items were identified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=8477)|
| 2:21:21| It was agreed between the city and CETA that the deferred maintenance items| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=8481)|
| 2:21:24| will be corrected and funded by CETA| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=8484)|
| 2:21:27| and then inspected by a third-party structural engineer to ensure compliance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=8487)|
| 2:21:31| The garage will be restriped.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=8491)|
| 2:21:33| Equipment will be added.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=8493)|
| 2:21:34| Elevators and elevator lobbies will be refurbished.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=8494)|
| 2:21:37| PVA will manage the operations of this garage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=8497)|
| 2:21:40| as they manage the operations at our other city garages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=8500)|
| 2:21:44| The garage work will be completed prior to occupancy of any of the south waterfront buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=8504)|
| 2:21:49| Fortunately, the pedestrian connection between the garage and the building is in good condition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=8509)|
| 2:21:53| CETA agreed to complete and pay for the needed interior renovations of this connection,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=8513)|
| 2:21:59| and Regal has agreed to complete and pay for the exterior renovations needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=8519)|
| 2:22:04| The interior and exterior renovations will match the Regal building plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=8524)|
| 2:22:08| Finally, as soon as all the project documents are executed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=8528)|
| 2:22:12| including the lease agreement between Regal and IDB,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=8532)|
| 2:22:15| the purchase and sell agreement between IDB and CETA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=8535)|
| 2:22:18| and the development and financing agreement between KCDC and CETA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=8538)|
| 2:22:21| and these support agreements we're presenting tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=8541)|
| 2:22:24| we will immediately deliver the building to Regal for commencement of their work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=8544)|
| 2:22:28| The project schedule for Regal is approximately 12 months from the start date,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=8548)|
| 2:22:32| and Regal is projecting an $11 million to $13 million construction budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=8552)|
| 2:22:36| but those are just the construction numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=8556)|
| 2:22:38| There will be substantial IT investment, of course, furniture and fixtures and equipment as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=8558)|
| 2:22:43| And finally, while 275 full-time employees are required to be maintained by Regal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=8563)|
| 2:22:48| Regal just reported to me last week that there are approximately 345 positions currently filled| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=8568)|
| 2:22:53| and scheduled to move to the new corporate headquarters,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=8573)|
| 2:22:56| with an additional 75 coming on board in the next five years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=8576)|
| 2:23:00| Yesterday afternoon, the IDB approved the purchase and sell agreement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=8580)|
| 2:23:04| the lease agreement, and the cooperation and support agreement with the City of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=8584)|
| 2:23:07| That's before you this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=8587)|
| 2:23:09| Also, KCDC approved the development and financing agreement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=8589)|
| 2:23:12| the tax increment financing documentation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=8592)|
| 2:23:15| and their support and cooperation agreement with the City of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=8595)|
| 2:23:18| So this evening, what we're asking is that City Council approve these two support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=8598)|
| 2:23:21| and cooperation agreements with the IDB and KCD.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=8601)|
| 2:23:25| And there's also representatives here on behalf of KCDC and the IDB,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=8605)|
| 2:23:30| should you want to ask them any direct questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=8610)|
| 2:23:32| And I said IDB.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=8612)|
| 2:23:33| I'm not sure someone's here from the IDB.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=8613)|
| 2:23:35| Yeah, just KCDC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=8615)|
| 2:23:38| Thank you, Christy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=8618)|
| 2:23:40| Councilman Dela Valle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=8620)|
| 2:23:42| Yeah, I just had a question on the first item in front of us, 11A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=8622)|
| 2:23:47| The clause in there, of course, it appoints KCDC to do all this wonderful stuff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=8627)|
| 2:23:53| with administrative and services and whatnot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=8633)|
| 2:23:57| But there's a clause that says that we, the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=8637)|
| 2:24:01| agree to contribute sufficient funds to KCDC to pay any and all costs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=8641)|
| 2:24:05| expenses, obligations, or liabilities associated with the administration of the project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=8645)|
| 2:24:10| and the performance of the duties and obligations they take under those documents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=8650)|
| 2:24:15| And I just don't have any idea what kind of money we're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=8655)|
| 2:24:18| We're obviously committing ourselves to reimbursing KCDC for something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=8658)|
| 2:24:23| Do we know?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=8663)|
| 2:24:24| Yeah, we did talk about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=8664)|
| 2:24:26| So we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=8666)|
| 2:24:27| This is like an interagency, intergovernmental-type agreement, obviously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=8667)|
| 2:24:32| And we rely on the KCDC and IDB as instrumentalities to help us effectuate the deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=8672)|
| 2:24:39| And we did talk about what those costs may be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=8679)|
| 2:24:42| There's going to be some accounting that is required on the TIF,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=8682)|
| 2:24:47| and KCDC will be performing that accounting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=8687)|
| 2:24:50| We are also hoping that we'll be able to pass that along,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=8690)|
| 2:24:53| that cost for the accounting on to the developer, CETA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=8693)|
| 2:24:56| That's the way we have it now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=8696)|
| 2:24:58| And those costs are minimal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=8698)|
| 2:25:00| They're estimated to be minimal every year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=8700)|
| 2:25:02| And did you guys want to add anything to that, Art?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=8702)|
| 2:25:07| Minimal in my budget might be different than the city's budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=8707)|
| 2:25:10| I think it was a couple thousand dollars or $5,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=8710)|
| 2:25:14| I'm trying to remember the exact number, but I know we've talked about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=8714)|
| 2:25:18| But this TIF accounting is a little more complicated than the typical deal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=8718)|
| 2:25:22| so we've talked about that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=8722)|
| 2:25:24| Please state your name and address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=8724)|
| 2:25:25| My name is Art Cate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=8725)|
| 2:25:26| I'm the executive director of Knoxville Community Development Corporation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=8726)|
| 2:25:29| and I live at 5525 Lonus Drive now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=8729)|
| 2:25:35| Christy's correct, basically, in what she said, Nick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=8735)|
| 2:25:41| The cost to be determined, basically we do whatever the city asks us to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=8741)|
| 2:25:48| It's typically what happens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=8748)|
| 2:25:51| But the ongoing is $5,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=8751)|
| 2:25:54| We split that, actually, between one-third, one-third,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=8754)|
| 2:25:57| between the city, KCDC, and Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=8757)|
| 2:26:02| This TIF is $22 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=8762)|
| 2:26:05| There's actually, like, it's really two TIFs, a superior and a subordinate note, basically,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=8765)|
| 2:26:14| and there's 12 parcels of land, I believe, which will be conveyed over a period of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=8774)|
| 2:26:18| So it is complicated, and the expenses may be a little more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=8778)|
| 2:26:24| Frankly, this is the first time we've done one similar to this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=8784)|
| 2:26:29| and as far as giving you a good figure, I'm sorry, I just cannot do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=8789)|
| 2:26:34| I think we're going to spend this next year really trying to determine what the cost may be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=8794)|
| 2:26:39| The other costs that there are, of course,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=8799)|
| 2:26:41| are third-party inspections from the structural inspector on the garage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=8801)|
| 2:26:45| That's being covered by CETA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=8805)|
| 2:26:47| There are also third-party inspections on the public improvements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=8807)|
| 2:26:50| and we have CETA paying for that as well through the development agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=8810)|
| 2:26:54| So those costs are taken care of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=8814)|
| 2:26:56| The only other costs that we can think of when we've talked about what costs there may be are the garage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=8816)|
| 2:27:01| And obviously, for this first year, we will not have any costs associated with the garage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=8821)|
| 2:27:05| because it will be going under construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=8825)|
| 2:27:07| CETA's going to fix it up, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=8827)|
| 2:27:09| CETA's going to fix it up at their cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=8829)|
| 2:27:11| And so we'll take this next year to really talk about the garage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=8831)|
| 2:27:15| When I did talk with PBA, they gave me a number of around $200,000 a year to operate and maintain the garage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=8835)|
| 2:27:21| If you look at, for example, Regal taking anywhere from 300, say, to 400 parking spaces,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=8841)|
| 2:27:28| that's about a third of the cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=8848)|
| 2:27:30| So it would be split evenly between the groups, a third, a third, and a third.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=8850)|
| 2:27:35| But that's a cost that we know we will have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=8855)|
| 2:27:39| but obviously we'll also have revenue coming in, too, hopefully.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=8859)|
| 2:27:42| That's a bigger cost than you're saying we're committing to KCDC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=8862)|
| 2:27:45| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=8865)|
| 2:27:46| Because we're asking them to do certain things and we're reimbursing them, basically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=8866)|
| 2:27:49| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=8869)|
| 2:27:50| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=8870)|
| 2:27:51| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=8871)|
| 2:27:52| And we just don't have a handle on the order of magnitude at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=8872)|
| 2:27:54| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=8874)|
| 2:27:55| We do on the TIF accounting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=8875)|
| 2:27:56| We do know it will be more complex.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=8876)|
| 2:27:57| But, I mean, I think we've talked about it being around $5,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=8877)|
| 2:28:01| And just because it's more complex, it may be a little more than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=8881)|
| 2:28:03| But we really need to get into it to make sure we have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=8883)|
| 2:28:05| That was truly minor, as you said, in comparison to the $9 million investment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=8885)|
| 2:28:08| That would be my description of minimal, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=8888)|
| 2:28:10| In the spirit of the $9 million investment, I mean, that's kind of okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=8890)|
| 2:28:13| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=8893)|
| 2:28:14| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=8894)|
| 2:28:15| I didn't see it in the papers and I didn't know what to think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=8895)|
| 2:28:16| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=8896)|
| 2:28:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=8897)|
| 2:28:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=8898)|
| 2:28:19| Martin, we didn't cause you to retire, did we, by doing this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=8899)|
| 2:28:21| What was that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=8901)|
| 2:28:23| I said we didn't cause you to retire by doing this, did we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=8903)|
| 2:28:28| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=8908)|
| 2:28:29| You will be missed when you do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=8909)|
| 2:28:30| I wish I could stay around and see some of these things to completion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=8910)|
| 2:28:34| I'll still be in Knoxville, obviously,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=8914)|
| 2:28:36| and I'll still be involved at some level and interested as we move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=8916)|
| 2:28:41| We can still count it as an accomplishment to have this finalized under your watch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=8921)|
| 2:28:48| Exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=8928)|
| 2:28:49| And I'm still around until 1231, so we've still got five months to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=8929)|
| 2:28:54| Hopefully we can accomplish some more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=8934)|
| 2:28:56| We'll see you at the economic summit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=8936)|
| 2:28:59| Couldn't get McAllister's in Fountain City, though, could we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=8939)|
| 2:29:03| Thank you, Nick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=8943)|
| 2:29:04| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=8944)|
| 2:29:05| Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=8945)|
| 2:29:06| Yes, Christy, a couple of questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=8946)|
| 2:29:08| So should Regal purchase the building, the garage doesn't go with it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=8948)|
| 2:29:11| so we would still retain the garage?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=8951)|
| 2:29:13| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=8953)|
| 2:29:14| We would still retain the garage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=8954)|
| 2:29:15| So they could buy the garage at $9 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=8955)|
| 2:29:18| Build the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=8958)|
| 2:29:19| Build the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=8959)|
| 2:29:20| So they could buy the building at any time, minus the $300,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=8960)|
| 2:29:24| and in the city we'd get all that money to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=8964)|
| 2:29:28| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=8968)|
| 2:29:29| Whatever the purchase price is, we don't have to split our proceeds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=8969)|
| 2:29:31| No, we do not split our proceeds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=8971)|
| 2:29:32| We get the proceeds back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=8972)|
| 2:29:34| The taxes are going to be on the full post redevelopment value.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=8974)|
| 2:29:39| Do you have an idea what you think those tax revenue will be to the city of Knoxville?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=8979)|
| 2:29:43| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=8983)|
| 2:29:44| Jim York and I looked at that this afternoon,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=8984)|
| 2:29:46| and right now it looks like we're collecting around $98,000 a year for the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=8986)|
| 2:29:51| and the county in property taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=8991)|
| 2:29:54| And this is using a $13 million budget for construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=8994)|
| 2:29:59| It looks like our real property tax collection will be about $262,355.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=8999)|
| 2:30:06| And then we used $2.5 million assumption for personal property tax collections,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=9006)|
| 2:30:12| and that added almost another $38,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=9012)|
| 2:30:16| So the total is well over $300,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=9016)|
| 2:30:21| Good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=9021)|
| 2:30:23| That's great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=9023)|
| 2:30:24| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=9024)|
| 2:30:25| Good job, and I look forward to supporting this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=9025)|
| 2:30:27| Great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=9027)|
| 2:30:29| That's $200,000 incremental, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=9029)|
| 2:30:31| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=9031)|
| 2:30:34| Councilman Delavan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=9034)|
| 2:30:35| I didn't understand the one thing you were saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=9035)|
| 2:30:37| If you buy the building later, you get to reduce it by $300,000 a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=9037)|
| 2:30:41| What does that represent, that $300,000?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=9041)|
| 2:30:45| $300,000 for every full rent year that Regal stays in the building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=9045)|
| 2:30:50| and operates as a corporate headquarters| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=9050)|
| 2:30:52| and maintains the minimum number of employees there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=9052)|
| 2:30:54| they get a $300,000 discount on that purchase price.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=9054)|
| 2:30:58| Even though they're not paying rent for those first 10 years, they get a discount?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=9058)|
| 2:31:01| No, they're paying full taxes for the first 10 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=9061)|
| 2:31:03| The next 10 years they would pay the dollar,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=9063)|
| 2:31:05| and then the next 10 would be the $2 per square foot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=9065)|
| 2:31:07| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=9067)|
| 2:31:08| But, yes, they would get,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=9068)|
| 2:31:09| because we've gotten the benefit of them being in our downtown for that full year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=9069)|
| 2:31:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=9072)|
| 2:31:13| So it represents more of that, the value added by bringing them to downtown Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=9073)|
| 2:31:17| Exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=9077)|
| 2:31:18| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=9078)|
| 2:31:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=9079)|
| 2:31:20| Any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=9080)|
| 2:31:21| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=9081)|
| 2:31:22| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=9082)|
| 2:31:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=9083)|
| 2:31:24| So we have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=9084)|
| 2:31:25| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=9085)|
| 2:31:26| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=9086)|
| 2:31:27| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=9087)|
| 2:31:28| The ayes have it, and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=9088)|
| 2:31:31| B, 11B.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=9091)|
| 2:31:33| 11B is a resolution authorizing the mayor to enter into a support and cooperation agreement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=9093)|
| 2:31:37| with the Industrial Development Board of the City of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=9097)|
| 2:31:40| to provide administrative and technical assistance, as well as funding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=9100)|
| 2:31:43| to the board to enable the board to perform its duties under the purchase agreement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=9103)|
| 2:31:48| for 101 East Blount Avenue, the subsequent lease agreement with Regal Cinemas, Inc.,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=9108)|
| 2:31:53| and a parking easement agreement for property generally located at 2011 K Street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=9113)|
| 2:31:58| and 100 East Blount Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=9118)|
| 2:32:01| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=9121)|
| 2:32:02| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=9122)|
| 2:32:03| Councilman Delgado.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=9123)|
| 2:32:04| Yes, if I could go back to Christy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=9124)|
| 2:32:05| Same question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=9125)|
| 2:32:06| Do you know what will be charged by IDB or what will owe them to fund their activity?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=9126)|
| 2:32:12| Well, we've already funded their activity to purchase the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=9132)|
| 2:32:16| We've also provided the funds that are needed for the tenant improvement contribution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=9136)|
| 2:32:21| And the great thing here is this particular lease.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=9141)|
| 2:32:25| As you know, I think I've sent it to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=9145)|
| 2:32:27| It was a triple net lease.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=9147)|
| 2:32:28| You said they do all the maintenance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=9148)|
| 2:32:29| They do all the maintenance, all the utilities, all the taxes, all the insurance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=9149)|
| 2:32:34| Everything is on Regal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=9154)|
| 2:32:35| And in addition to that, CETA, the developer, also just replaced the roof on the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=9155)|
| 2:32:40| So they have a great new roof that's been inspected by our staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=9160)|
| 2:32:44| And so the roof is in great condition as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=9164)|
| 2:32:47| All the systems, all the equipments, everything is on Regal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=9167)|
| 2:32:50| IDB is a landlord, so to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=9170)|
| 2:32:53| Do they have significant expenses or is that another?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=9173)|
| 2:32:56| No, there are no significant expenses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=9176)|
| 2:32:59| We will work out a scenario with them about how we collect the rent, obviously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=9179)|
| 2:33:03| And if, for example, Regal were to purchase the building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=9183)|
| 2:33:06| then IDB would be the conduit for getting the money back to the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=9186)|
| 2:33:10| Okay, because they're our agent in a sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=9190)|
| 2:33:12| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=9192)|
| 2:33:13| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=9193)|
| 2:33:14| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=9194)|
