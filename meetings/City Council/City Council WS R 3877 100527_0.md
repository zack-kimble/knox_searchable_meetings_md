| 0:02:01| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=121)|
| 0:02:06| I have an agenda. Let me do a quick, just first off, are there any announcements from council people on any subject,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=126)|
| 0:02:12| anything anybody has to say? Mr. Greve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=132)|
| 0:02:18| Thank you, Mr. Greve. I would not have noticed if you hadn't brought that up. Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=138)|
| 0:02:23| Mr. Brown is over there all by himself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=143)|
| 0:02:28| Miss Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=148)|
| 0:02:36| Well, in that spirit, I should announce that Fountain City is having a Fountain City Day Memorial Day celebration on Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=156)|
| 0:02:41| It will run from about noon to, I think, 8 p.m., and there will be a presentation for veterans around 4 p.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=161)|
| 0:02:46| at the lake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=166)|
| 0:02:51| No other announcements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=171)|
| 0:03:15| Let me do two quick introductory comments on the workshop, and then I'll turn it over to only three quick introductory comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=195)|
| 0:03:21| And I'll turn it over to Mr. Lyons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=201)|
| 0:03:26| The structure of this is Bill's going to do sort of a general overview of development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=206)|
| 0:03:31| Rhonda Rice is going to do an explanation of the work of the chamber, which is one of our development tools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=211)|
| 0:03:36| Then Bill Lyons is going to come back and talk more specifically about some development tools the city has.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=216)|
| 0:03:41| And then Mike Carberry is here to talk about some of the MPC tools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=221)|
| 0:03:46| I always like to suggest, I know this council has a lot of questions, a lot of very good questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=226)|
| 0:03:51| I'm going to ask folks to use their lights and use a little discretion on, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=231)|
| 0:03:56| not asking if it can wait until the end of a person's presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=236)|
| 0:04:01| If it's more general, if there's a clarification, please ask it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=241)|
| 0:04:06| Thank you, Mr. Becker. I duly note it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=246)|
| 0:04:11| This is a workshop that is purely educational.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=251)|
| 0:04:16| We, as part of our job, need to learn a lot of what's going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=256)|
| 0:04:21| I was going to say that nothing that we're being presented is anything we're going to have to vote on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=261)|
| 0:04:26| Mr. Carberry pointed out that this afternoon he told me a bunch of the, I guess the conservation tools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=266)|
| 0:04:31| and maybe even some of the development tools are proposals that are moving in MPC now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=271)|
| 0:04:37| and will be coming to us for changing some law, if I'm correct on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=277)|
| 0:04:42| And he can fill in more detail on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=282)|
| 0:04:47| The final thing I wanted to say, just a word about how broad this topic can be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=287)|
| 0:04:52| First, there are people, I'm sure, across the hill that are getting Ph.D.s in a little piece of what we're going to talk about today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=292)|
| 0:04:57| So this is a very deep subject.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=297)|
| 0:05:02| When I was doing the interviews with everybody last fall about the orientation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=302)|
| 0:05:07| one of the things that people talked about was sort of a need for an overview of everything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=307)|
| 0:05:12| not just talking about this lot zoning and this is this department budget, but something that's bigger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=312)|
| 0:05:19| This is not a workshop like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=319)|
| 0:05:24| There's a bigger vision out there someplace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=324)|
| 0:05:29| We have one slide on that, and with that, I will turn it over to Mr. Lyons for the overview.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=329)|
| 0:05:37| Thank you, Mr. Lyons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=337)|
| 0:05:42| What I'd like to do is I'm going to try to go through this quickly because we have an awful lot to go through today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=342)|
| 0:05:47| and as Bob said, we have one slide that's sort of your big picture,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=347)|
| 0:05:52| and I definitely think this is worth talking about and using to help frame everything else that we do as we get into this topic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=352)|
| 0:05:57| Basically, we're talking about city and city government and its role in development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=357)|
| 0:06:02| and I guess the assumption we could start with is the blank slate would be you do absolutely nothing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=362)|
| 0:06:08| The city does absolutely nothing, and many cities have approached that over time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=368)|
| 0:06:14| and evolved over the years to doing an awful lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=374)|
| 0:06:19| By doing absolutely nothing, that would be the market would determine what every single person would do with his or her property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=379)|
| 0:06:24| that there would be minimal regulations, only those required for public safety,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=384)|
| 0:06:29| there would be no incentives, there would be no disincentives, and you could just let things proceed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=389)|
| 0:06:35| Now, we're a municipal corporation put together to achieve certain collect goals that we have together as citizens,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=395)|
| 0:06:42| and we've established a whole variety of laws, ordinances, rules,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=402)|
| 0:06:47| Metropolitan Planning Commission established to assist in all of that to govern the way we develop,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=407)|
| 0:06:52| and that's a pretty common assumption, that's what a major role of the city is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=412)|
| 0:06:57| and as I tell people who begin to become involved in city politics or observe it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=417)|
| 0:07:02| a really tremendous amount of the time is spent on land use, how land is going to be used,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=422)|
| 0:07:07| and we did a time study of what council spends its time on, I think that would be easily borne out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=427)|
| 0:07:12| So one of the things we're doing here today is talking, now that we've swooped down a few hundred feet at least,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=432)|
| 0:07:17| is as we consider development, what things are we looking for, for the overall good of the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=437)|
| 0:07:23| and one of the key, obviously, points to make is we have a need for economic opportunity for our citizens,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=443)|
| 0:07:29| and I'm going to start this and then turn it over to Rhonda Rice from the Chamber and the Development Corporation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=449)|
| 0:07:35| she's going to talk about that more specifically, how we achieve that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=455)|
| 0:07:40| Job recruitment and retention is obviously at the top of that list,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=460)|
| 0:07:45| we need to keep things going, not only, and we could get into the obvious, to provide an invigorated tax base,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=465)|
| 0:07:51| to provide reasons for people to stay, to have reasons for people to come,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=471)|
| 0:07:56| and to just fund our quality of life, and this city and every other city plays an active role in that, we have to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=476)|
| 0:08:02| It's a competitive environment and we're competing with other communities for jobs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=482)|
| 0:08:07| and that's an awful lot of what we do, and as I discussed, we will turn that over for a more detailed presentation from Rhonda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=487)|
| 0:08:13| We obviously need to be viable to fund government services, I don't need to go into detail about that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=493)|
| 0:08:20| that's fairly obvious, we don't grow the pressures that we have on the budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=500)|
| 0:08:25| and are sufficient that we have real problems with just basic services that we need to get by day-to-day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=505)|
| 0:08:30| public safety, and everything else that's so critical to our lives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=510)|
| 0:08:35| I want to spend a little more time on really what the development function and what you as council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=515)|
| 0:08:40| and the administration, what we together have before us, and this language pops up as I listen at a lot of council meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=520)|
| 0:08:46| and when talking with a lot of you, that is how do we get and implement a sense of what our community values are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=526)|
| 0:08:53| what our priorities might be, sort of, and that may add up to a community vision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=533)|
| 0:08:58| and that's something I think we have a lot of tools to help achieve,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=538)|
| 0:09:03| and we can achieve that piecemeal, and sometimes that may not be a bad idea,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=543)|
| 0:09:08| some of these tools may be applied globally, as we try to come to grips with exactly what we do on a decision-by-decision basis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=548)|
| 0:09:15| that puts flesh on the bones of what kind of city we want to be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=555)|
| 0:09:20| and really the best way I see to look at that is the tool, the big global toolbox we have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=560)|
| 0:09:25| is we've got capital investment, where we spend the dollars we have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=565)|
| 0:09:30| that is certainly a very key element, what roads we build, what bridges we build,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=570)|
| 0:09:35| what parks we build, greenways, all of that, and how much we put into those amenities as opposed to others,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=575)|
| 0:09:42| all of that leads to the way the city develops, is key to how the city develops,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=582)|
| 0:09:47| just our own investment, and to support the development that's occurred.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=587)|
| 0:09:52| The other, and this is a lot of what we do in our department, is we have a limited,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=592)|
| 0:09:57| and I'll get into later exactly why that's the case, a limited but valuable set of incentives in our toolbox| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=597)|
| 0:10:02| that we can use to help push development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=602)|
| 0:10:07| We can't do it for the private sector, but we can provide the private sector incentives| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=607)|
| 0:10:12| to do something that they might not otherwise do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=612)|
| 0:10:17| Likewise, we have some disincentives we can present, and we have obvious regulations through land use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=617)|
| 0:10:22| which Mike Carberry is going to talk more about how we go about that, and again, we deal with that every week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=622)|
| 0:10:27| Is such a key to this, and how we implement that land use policy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=627)|
| 0:10:32| and I think something we could probably spend some time on is we can look at that citywide,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=632)|
| 0:10:37| and a lot of our rules have been applied across the city, and we think across the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=637)|
| 0:10:42| but as we've gotten into some very interesting areas, and I think we've matured in how we've discussed this in my time here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=642)|
| 0:10:48| and it's been great working with council on that, we've seen that all the rules,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=648)|
| 0:10:53| and it's been great working with council on that, and it's been great working with council on that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=653)|
| 0:11:00| because it would develop in a different manner than other areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=660)|
| 0:11:05| We've seen how valuable that can be, and we've looked at other ways to guide a specific vision in a specific area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=665)|
| 0:11:11| Cumberland Avenue is following along like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=671)|
| 0:11:16| Downtown North definitely is one that's grown and started to happen right on our watch here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=676)|
| 0:11:21| and that's one thing I can spend a little time on, maybe making this come down a few more feet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=681)|
| 0:11:28| to explaining the kind of opportunities we have with all of those incentives, disincentives, and investment and regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=688)|
| 0:11:36| I'll talk a little bit about Downtown North.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=696)|
| 0:11:41| First of all, what is now called Downtown North that we've branded that way, and it seems to have taken remarkably well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=701)|
| 0:11:46| is the idea that we started off talking about 5th and Broadway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=706)|
| 0:11:51| I co-chaired a committee with Councilman Woodhull.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=711)|
| 0:11:56| We assembled a large number of citizens in response to, and I almost hate to get into this topic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=716)|
| 0:12:01| but MinnVilla in the 10-year plan decision in reaction to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=721)|
| 0:12:06| In doing so, in speaking with citizens, we decided to not only deal with the issues that were there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=726)|
| 0:12:11| but to say, well, this is a great area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=731)|
| 0:12:16| How can we use this as an opportunity to start a vision, a community vision, an inclusive vision on what the area could be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=736)|
| 0:12:21| and see what the city could do to use our toolbox to see that happen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=741)|
| 0:12:26| That vision and a lot of discussion, and I'm pleased to say that the continuing council folks were there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=746)|
| 0:12:31| at many, many of the meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=751)|
| 0:12:36| Councilman Woodhull, very many of them, as was Councilman Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=756)|
| 0:12:41| We had a lot of council involvement in establishing what this vision was and discussed with the folks there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=761)|
| 0:12:46| we wanted to be more pedestrian, more walkable, mixed-use development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=766)|
| 0:12:54| We even got down to the kinds of look and feel that citizens saw it might have that built on its strengths| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=774)|
| 0:12:59| with art, work, live-work, artist environment that we needed to build on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=779)|
| 0:13:06| To consider the physical structure that supported that, the street, the sidewalks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=786)|
| 0:13:13| and all the way that we can use the tools the city had to help drive that to completion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=793)|
| 0:13:19| A very important partner in that, I know Madeline is here, Rojero from the Community Development Department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=799)|
| 0:13:24| was using a set of the tools that are funded through the Empowerment Zone and other federal funds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=804)|
| 0:13:29| to bring the facade program to bear there to help many of the businesses develop in a certain way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=809)|
| 0:13:34| That was all very area-specific and it really showed the power of government working subtly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=814)|
| 0:13:40| not in a heavy hand, to achieve an awful lot of goals that we all felt and the community felt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=820)|
| 0:13:46| Just briefly, we used tax increment financing to help 9-12 North Central, a nice residential piece,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=826)|
| 0:13:52| develop that would have not otherwise developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=832)|
| 0:13:57| Brownlow School was a real challenge in that area, we developed a special policy and helped Brownlow develop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=837)|
| 0:14:02| There was an investment and concern with the Arts and Crafts Center that had to move from the Candy Factory| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=842)|
| 0:14:07| and the folks there said, we'd love it here, and we looked for a place and found it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=847)|
| 0:14:12| We've had a fairly modest actual appropriated dollar investment more this year in the capital budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=852)|
| 0:14:18| to fleshing out the sidewalks, the roads, and the look.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=858)|
| 0:14:23| Bob Wetzel has got primary responsibility for that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=863)|
| 0:14:29| I think it's safe to say that had none of us engaged in that effort, that the whole area of Central and Broadway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=869)|
| 0:14:35| and in between moving north would look nothing like it's already looking today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=875)|
| 0:14:40| let alone having it redefined from something negative into something positive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=880)|
| 0:14:45| We use the phrase moving from disinvestment to investment and using the tools to get there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=885)|
| 0:14:51| That was an example of how we can take an area-specific approach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=891)|
| 0:14:56| Well, I think I'm flying around wasting a little too much time at this height,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=896)|
| 0:15:01| so what I want to do, if you'll go to the next slide, is...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=901)|
| 0:15:06| Development partners are key.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=906)|
| 0:15:11| We have internal development partners, we work together very closely with community development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=911)|
| 0:15:16| we work with planning, obviously MPC is a partner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=916)|
| 0:15:21| Recruiting back to the beginning of that slide, we don't have any economic development department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=921)|
| 0:15:26| I was sort of a one-person economic development department and obviously needed...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=926)|
| 0:15:31| There was a lot to be desired there because we decided to change that around a little,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=931)|
| 0:15:36| but my job was working with our chamber and development corporation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=936)|
| 0:15:41| and we have a contract with the chamber to do the recruiting of business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=941)|
| 0:15:46| And we're not funded and we don't have anybody assigned the major task of doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=946)|
| 0:15:51| So the chamber and the development corporation provide us with great staff assistance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=951)|
| 0:15:56| We meet regularly, a group, every two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=956)|
| 0:16:01| And again, including some other partners along with community development with Madeline and Bob Wetzel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=961)|
| 0:16:06| and the mayor and Larry Martin and discuss what these opportunities are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=966)|
| 0:16:12| and we think been very successful in showing folks that Knoxville is a good place to locate business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=972)|
| 0:16:20| So I think at this time, I think what our plan is, is I'll turn it over to Rhonda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=980)|
| 0:16:25| She's going to go through really in much more length that piece of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=985)|
| 0:16:30| Then we're going to come back and I'm going to talk about those things in the city's toolbox that I'd mentioned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=990)|
| 0:16:35| that we applied more directly to downtown north because not only is this about bringing businesses in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=995)|
| 0:16:40| this is about development for the quality of life for folks who live here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=1000)|
| 0:16:45| It's about growing businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=1005)|
| 0:16:48| It's about, and obviously key to any business recruitment is the city has got to be attractive enough in all its amenities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=1008)|
| 0:16:53| and all that it provides where folks want to come here aside from making the financial deals that make it attractive for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=1013)|
| 0:16:59| So Rhonda, I'll turn it over to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=1019)|
| 0:17:05| Sure, I'll do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=1025)|
| 0:17:10| While you're coming up, I actually need to do one thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=1030)|
| 0:17:13| We actually, our council rules do not allow for public forum at workshops.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=1033)|
| 0:17:18| So I'm going to say without objection, public forum is added to our agenda and I see no objection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=1038)|
| 0:17:23| We have a sign-up sheet over here on the side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=1043)|
| 0:17:26| We'll do public forum at the end of the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=1046)|
| 0:17:29| Thank you for that opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=1049)|
| 0:17:33| Bill Lyons told me I had four seconds on each slide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=1053)|
| 0:17:38| So hopefully it won't be that bad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=1058)|
| 0:17:41| Now go back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=1061)|
| 0:17:44| Thank you for having us here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=1064)|
| 0:17:47| Rhonda Rice with Knoxville Chamber as well as Doug Lawyer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=1067)|
| 0:17:50| It seems like we've been trying to get together for some time to talk about this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=1070)|
| 0:17:54| but I appreciate your all's time this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=1074)|
| 0:17:57| And I am going to go through this fairly quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=1077)|
| 0:18:00| This is a high-level look.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=1080)|
| 0:18:03| You have some information packets with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=1083)|
| 0:18:05| I'm going to talk in some detail about that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=1085)|
| 0:18:08| but I want to say first and foremost that Doug and I or either one of us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=1088)|
| 0:18:13| we're more than happy to sit down with you any time individually as a group| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=1093)|
| 0:18:18| or whatever is your preference to talk about any of these initiatives in a specific format.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=1098)|
| 0:18:25| As Dr. Lyons said, we are the city's economic development agency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=1105)|
| 0:18:29| We are very honored by that charge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=1109)|
| 0:18:32| and we take great pride and very serious diligence in what we try to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=1112)|
| 0:18:36| and represent the city of Knoxville, not only in Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=1116)|
| 0:18:40| not only in the state of Tennessee, but worldwide, if you will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=1120)|
| 0:18:44| So Knoxville, Oak Ridge, Innovation Valley is our economic development program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=1124)|
| 0:18:52| And just a pretty little slide here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=1132)|
| 0:18:55| We started several years ago with private leadership| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=1135)|
| 0:18:58| and looking at what we really needed to do to raise the level of Knoxville in our region| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=1138)|
| 0:19:05| to really emphasize and talk about where we could join and be successful| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=1145)|
| 0:19:10| in not only sustaining the companies that we have here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=1150)|
| 0:19:13| but to market to new prospects and individuals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=1153)|
| 0:19:17| Innovation Valley was designed and put together as an investor direct program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=1157)|
| 0:19:24| that focused on recruiting, retaining, and expanding industries here in our area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=1164)|
| 0:19:32| A lot of times we will talk about a prospect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=1172)|
| 0:19:35| and what actually is a business prospect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=1175)|
| 0:19:39| A prospect is someone usually represented by a site selection consultant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=1179)|
| 0:19:45| or a corporate real estate person or an attorney| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=1185)|
| 0:19:50| representing a private entity who is looking at expanding into the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=1190)|
| 0:19:55| We have a variety of ways that we generate leads to get prospects,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=1195)|
| 0:20:00| either through the state of Tennessee's Economic and Community Development Office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=1200)|
| 0:20:04| the Tennessee Valley Authority has a very successful and aggressive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=1204)|
| 0:20:07| marketing program in economic development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=1207)|
| 0:20:10| direct contact with our site consultants,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=1210)|
| 0:20:13| direct contact with companies in specific and targeted industries,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=1213)|
| 0:20:17| and I'll come back to that in a minute,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=1217)|
| 0:20:19| as well as people here in our community and folks such as yourself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=1219)|
| 0:20:24| There are several of you who have contacted us and said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=1224)|
| 0:20:26| hey, you need to call this company or whether it's a local company| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=1226)|
| 0:20:29| or a company that might be interested in moving to Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=1229)|
| 0:20:33| So we work with those different types of agencies to generate leads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=1233)|
| 0:20:37| We do a lot of cold calls, if you will,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=1237)|
| 0:20:41| to get down to the funnel of the companies that really are interested in making a decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=1241)|
| 0:20:46| So what is that process?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=1246)|
| 0:20:48| The first thing that we usually look at,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=1248)|
| 0:20:50| if a company is talking to us about locating to the Knoxville area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=1250)|
| 0:20:54| we need to know what their requirements are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=1254)|
| 0:20:57| We want to understand what their needs are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=1257)|
| 0:20:59| and if we're a good fit here in this community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=1259)|
| 0:21:01| Those needs can include either land or buildings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=1261)|
| 0:21:05| the workforce needs, what utilities may be available,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=1265)|
| 0:21:09| if it's a heavy user of power,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=1269)|
| 0:21:11| they want to make sure that they're going to have good quality, solid power here in the area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=1271)|
| 0:21:15| and then the transportation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=1275)|
| 0:21:17| There are a lot of other factors that come into play.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=1277)|
| 0:21:20| Sometimes it may be something as much as whether a spouse likes the Knoxville community or not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=1280)|
| 0:21:26| that can be the final decision on a project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=1286)|
| 0:21:28| You'd be surprised how many times that comes into play.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=1288)|
| 0:21:31| But that's important, so you've got to sell the whole package.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=1291)|
| 0:21:36| But it's a very comprehensive package when they look at these things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=1296)|
| 0:21:39| but it does get down to them making a business decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=1299)|
| 0:21:43| The process has changed dramatically even in my tenure in doing this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=1303)|
| 0:21:49| It used to be that about a month or so in advance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=1309)|
| 0:21:52| we'd get an RFI request from a consultant or a company,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=1312)|
| 0:21:56| and they'd say, we've got somebody looking at your area, maybe somewhere in Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=1316)|
| 0:22:02| You've got three or four weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=1322)|
| 0:22:03| You need to get this information back to us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=1323)|
| 0:22:06| and we'll let you know if we're coming to visit or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=1326)|
| 0:22:09| That has obviously changed with technology and with the Internet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=1329)|
| 0:22:13| Now, much to Doug's dismay, sometimes we get about 24 hours' notice if we're lucky.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=1333)|
| 0:22:20| And at that point in time, they have already made a decision to come and look at Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=1340)|
| 0:22:26| because if they are calling us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=1346)|
| 0:22:28| they have gone through a very extensive selection process at that time to evaluate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=1348)|
| 0:22:34| and so we have to make sure that we've got all the information needed out front and on our websites| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=1354)|
| 0:22:39| and with all the other agencies so that they know what they're looking at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=1359)|
| 0:22:43| Then they go through an RFI process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=1363)|
| 0:22:46| We hope to complete that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=1366)|
| 0:22:48| And, you know, one of the analogies that we always use is to not be eliminated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=1368)|
| 0:22:53| Our play is to stay in the game.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=1373)|
| 0:22:55| And so hopefully what we get out of that RFI is a site visit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=1375)|
| 0:23:00| And then once they get to the site, they look at it, and the site being all of Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=1380)|
| 0:23:05| and you usually have about two or three hours to show the entire community all its assets and resources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=1385)|
| 0:23:12| Then if you make that cut and they call back or they want to come back,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=1392)|
| 0:23:17| then you may get into negotiations on incentives or what the building rates are going to be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=1397)|
| 0:23:22| and so it gets to a different level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=1402)|
| 0:23:25| The whole time, we're trying to win.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=1405)|
| 0:23:27| We do not want to be eliminated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=1407)|
| 0:23:30| Again, there are various factors that may come into play in that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=1410)|
| 0:23:33| but one of the things that we did with Innovation Valley the first time that's ever been done here in this region| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=1413)|
| 0:23:39| is we have a regional partnership with six economic development agencies here in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=1419)|
| 0:23:46| And while we represent the city of Knoxville and Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=1426)|
| 0:23:50| understand that when people call Knoxville, they may be looking at something in Lenore City,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=1430)|
| 0:23:55| but they think it's Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=1435)|
| 0:23:57| And so if that's the case, then that's still good for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=1437)|
| 0:24:01| And so we want to grow and help that because we still can help to increase a lot of sales tax generation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=1441)|
| 0:24:07| a lot of jobs, a lot of things that are going to make Knoxville an even better place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=1447)|
| 0:24:11| So our partner agencies, one of the ways we look at it, we say it's from the airport to the lab.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=1451)|
| 0:24:16| And you've got Blount County Chamber, obviously the Knoxville Chamber,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=1456)|
| 0:24:20| Loudoun County Economic Development Agency, Oak Ridge Economic Partnership,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=1460)|
| 0:24:24| Rhone Alliance, and the Teleco Reservoir Development Agency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=1464)|
| 0:24:28| Innovation Valley is chaired by Dr. Tom Mason of the Oak Ridge National Laboratory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=1468)|
| 0:24:34| The board is made up of private sector business folks who really critique| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=1474)|
| 0:24:41| and challenge us in our budget and everything that we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=1481)|
| 0:24:44| They want to know how we're spending their money and how we are making these things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=1484)|
| 0:24:49| We have a very set standard of metrics and goals that we report back to them on a regular basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=1489)|
| 0:24:55| We have six program areas that we focus on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=1495)|
| 0:24:58| And I think this is very important because economic development, as I mentioned earlier, it's not one thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=1498)|
| 0:25:05| It's a combination of many things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=1505)|
| 0:25:08| We had a strategic consulting firm work with us about four years ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=1508)|
| 0:25:12| to really begin to nail down the areas of focus and then the plan within that focus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=1512)|
| 0:25:17| These six areas that the chamber works on through our economic development program are education| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=1517)|
| 0:25:23| and workforce development, technology and entrepreneurship, global marketing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=1523)|
| 0:25:29| business retention and expansion, public policy, and resources for living.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=1529)|
| 0:25:35| These six, I always think of them in concentric circles because they go together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=1535)|
| 0:25:41| Because without education and a skilled workforce, you're not going to retain the companies that you have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=1541)|
| 0:25:47| You're not going to recruit new companies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=1547)|
| 0:25:49| If you're not recruiting and you're not keeping, you're not going to be advertising.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=1549)|
| 0:25:53| You need to make sure that you have the public policies in place from a state level that are favorable for business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=1553)|
| 0:25:59| and help companies to grow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=1559)|
| 0:26:02| And then also things like better flights at the airport, air quality, infrastructure, roads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=1562)|
| 0:26:08| All these things are all wrapped into this program in what we are doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=1568)|
| 0:26:14| The budget for Innovation Valley is about $1.8 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=1574)|
| 0:26:20| You can see that about 48% of that is public funding, 52% is private funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=1580)|
| 0:26:26| Of that 48%, that includes public funding from the partners in their communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=1586)|
| 0:26:32| That's not just Knoxville and Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=1592)|
| 0:26:34| That's the partners and the communities within the Innovation Valley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=1594)|
| 0:26:39| You see how there is a breakdown of how the dollars are spent in each of the programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=1599)|
| 0:26:44| And one of the things that you'll notice is that there is a large percentage of our budget spent on education| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=1604)|
| 0:26:50| and workforce development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=1610)|
| 0:26:52| You may be aware that the Chamber has been very active in education,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=1612)|
| 0:26:56| and it is on the forefront of about everything that we're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=1616)|
| 0:26:59| As a matter of fact, Mike Edwards, our CEO, was going to be here this afternoon,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=1619)|
| 0:27:04| and he was called to Nashville by Governor Bredesen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=1624)|
| 0:27:07| He has been asked to serve on the Teacher Evaluation Advisory Committee for the governor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=1627)|
| 0:27:12| and so he called me about an hour and a half ago and was still stuck in traffic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=1632)|
| 0:27:17| and wanted me to let you know that he apologized for not being able to be here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=1637)|
| 0:27:20| But he is working on something that we feel is important,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=1640)|
| 0:27:24| and education is really the key to us being a successful community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=1644)|
| 0:27:31| A couple of slides about some successes and how they have happened here in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=1651)|
| 0:27:39| One of the things that we are extremely pleased about that was a very long process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=1659)|
| 0:27:48| was when Cisco Corporation announced that they would build their facility here in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=1668)|
| 0:27:53| And I'm not sure how many of you remember this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=1673)|
| 0:27:58| but the Costa Shop property obviously went through its ups and downs, if you will,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=1678)|
| 0:28:03| but the city made an investment and turned that property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=1683)|
| 0:28:06| which was a pretty rough piece of property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=1686)|
| 0:28:09| with extreme cost into something that could be marketed and sold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=1689)|
| 0:28:15| There was a project that came through TVA, and Doug had been working with them for a while,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=1695)|
| 0:28:21| and we didn't know at that point in time who that was, who this company was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=1701)|
| 0:28:25| We knew it was a major company that was looking for a distribution site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=1705)|
| 0:28:31| but they eliminated Knoxville quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=1711)|
| 0:28:34| We had shown them some existing buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=1714)|
| 0:28:36| We had shown them some land, but they were not pleased with anything that had been available,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=1716)|
| 0:28:41| and they were literally within hours away of making a decision to locate in Greenville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=1721)|
| 0:28:47| And Doug kept talking to them, kept talking to TVA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=1727)|
| 0:28:51| and they were about to leave the region,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=1731)|
| 0:28:53| and he said they called back late afternoon and said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=1733)|
| 0:28:57| okay, show us that Costa Shop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=1737)|
| 0:28:59| We'll come look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=1739)|
| 0:29:01| So everybody scrambles, and we go to Costa to look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=1741)|
| 0:29:06| And the site consultant says, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=1746)|
| 0:29:09| you want me to tell my company to put a food distribution project on a brownfield site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=1749)|
| 0:29:16| And we said, yes, sir, we do, and here's why.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=1756)|
| 0:29:19| So we made the pitch, the location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=1759)|
| 0:29:22| This was going to be a new design and operation for their facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=1762)|
| 0:29:26| This is the first one that they were doing, a fold-out distribution they called it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=1766)|
| 0:29:30| and this was going to be their showcase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=1770)|
| 0:29:34| After about two-and-a-half years of negotiating and going back and forth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=1774)|
| 0:29:41| we were able to have that announcement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=1781)|
| 0:29:43| and I think all of you will agree that if you look at that site and as you drive by it now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=1783)|
| 0:29:49| in that community that it was an investment well worth making for all parties involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=1789)|
| 0:29:55| But it was a very long process, and we fought hard for it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=1795)|
| 0:29:59| and Mayor Haslam was instrumental involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=1799)|
| 0:30:02| Some of you guys were involved, and even private sector citizens, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=1802)|
| 0:30:07| that we asked to help us to really make this deal work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=1807)|
| 0:30:11| So it takes a lot of things to make it happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=1811)|
| 0:30:16| The next company was, apparently we're doing food-related companies here today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=1816)|
| 0:30:23| Green Mountain Coffee Roasters came to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=1823)|
| 0:30:26| Doug had been to Chicago to meet with appointments that he had set up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=1826)|
| 0:30:32| with different site consultants, and so we go into these major cities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=1832)|
| 0:30:35| where there are a group of consultants, and we spend 24, 36 hours,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=1835)|
| 0:30:40| just one-on-one meetings talking to them about Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=1840)|
| 0:30:43| telling them why they need to consider this if projects come along.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=1843)|
| 0:30:47| Sometime later we got a call, and it happened to be from a particular site consultant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=1847)|
| 0:30:52| that he had met with, and they said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=1852)|
| 0:30:54| We've got a project, we need a greenfield site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=1854)|
| 0:30:56| we're looking to come to East Tennessee and put something here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=1856)|
| 0:31:00| We looked, we looked, they didn't like anything we saw.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=1860)|
| 0:31:04| The building out in Forks of the River had been Hess Distribution Center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=1864)|
| 0:31:09| had been Blue Mountain Wall Coverings, and had been Colliers International,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=1869)|
| 0:31:16| and had sold several times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=1876)|
| 0:31:19| It was a great building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=1879)|
| 0:31:20| It was over 300,000 square feet, set on 33-plus acres,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=1880)|
| 0:31:24| and we really thought they could make this building work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=1884)|
| 0:31:28| And the reason this building worked is because it was 300,000 square feet shell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=1888)|
| 0:31:36| When Collins and Aikman had been in there, and they had had a wallpaper distribution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=1896)|
| 0:31:41| they had a $10 million racking and sales system in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=1901)|
| 0:31:44| That thing had been completely taken apart and dismantled,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=1904)|
| 0:31:48| and you could walk through the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=1908)|
| 0:31:50| I mean, you could play football, you could probably fly some small planes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=1910)|
| 0:31:53| or do a number of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=1913)|
| 0:31:54| I mean, it was just a big, empty building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=1914)|
| 0:31:57| We convinced Green Mountain to look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=1917)|
| 0:31:59| They began to negotiate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=1919)|
| 0:32:01| Doug had the broker out of Atlanta.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=1921)|
| 0:32:05| The building owner was out of California.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=1925)|
| 0:32:07| The company was out of Vermont, and the site consultant was out of Chicago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=1927)|
| 0:32:12| So you had all these people trying to work together,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=1932)|
| 0:32:15| at least to make this part of the deal happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=1935)|
| 0:32:19| What we have today is a project that has exceeded their initial announcement of coming to Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=1939)|
| 0:32:25| They have invested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=1945)|
| 0:32:27| They did hit all their metrics and goals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=1947)|
| 0:32:29| and have even expanded and are now operating more lines for production than originally intended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=1949)|
| 0:32:37| And in that situation, it worked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=1957)|
| 0:32:39| You try to make what works for the company fit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=1959)|
| 0:32:43| You try to sell your best assets and make sure that what you're doing is going to work for that company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=1963)|
| 0:32:48| But now it's a $55 million investment, more than 350 jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=1968)|
| 0:32:52| They are continuing to grow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=1972)|
| 0:32:54| We've had other projects now look at this area as a result of our relationship with that consultant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=1974)|
| 0:33:01| and the deal that we were able to put together for Green Mountain Coffee Roasters| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=1981)|
| 0:33:05| in utilizing all the talents here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=1985)|
| 0:33:10| It's a great company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=1990)|
| 0:33:12| They're very environmentally sound.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=1992)|
| 0:33:14| They're very involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=1994)|
| 0:33:16| This company, it was neat because when they came in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=1996)|
| 0:33:19| after they had gone through and gone through and gone through,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=1999)|
| 0:33:22| and this process was fast.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=2002)|
| 0:33:24| They had to be up and running and ready.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=2004)|
| 0:33:26| It was probably seven to eight months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=2006)|
| 0:33:28| So it gives you an idea of sometimes they can go years and sometimes they can be very quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=2008)|
| 0:33:32| But they met with United Way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=2012)|
| 0:33:34| They wanted to meet with community resources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=2014)|
| 0:33:36| They wanted to understand what the Knoxville community was like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=2016)|
| 0:33:40| Next slide is Science Applications International Corporation in Oak Ridge, SAIC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=2020)|
| 0:33:46| Why is this up here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=2026)|
| 0:33:48| We get a lot of business interested in our relationship with the Oak Ridge National Lab.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=2028)|
| 0:33:53| SAIC had a presence here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=2033)|
| 0:33:55| They decided to make their shared services headquarters here in this area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=2035)|
| 0:34:00| $10 million new investment, 300 new jobs that are well-paying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=2040)|
| 0:34:04| and a lot of people from this region are employed there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=2044)|
| 0:34:08| Next slide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=2048)|
| 0:34:11| In January of 2009, we got hit with some pretty good whammies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=2051)|
| 0:34:16| We got Goody's closing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=2056)|
| 0:34:19| We got Alcoa downsizing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=2059)|
| 0:34:21| And then on January the 9th, ImagePoint called a meeting and closed their doors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=2061)|
| 0:34:28| I think we all felt the ripple of that through downtown,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=2068)|
| 0:34:31| and we really just couldn't believe that it happened, what was going on here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=2071)|
| 0:34:37| But we got with our Innovation Valley partners and talked about, okay, what can we do in regards to this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=2077)|
| 0:34:44| We contacted, had different meetings with some of the employees of ImagePoint,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=2084)|
| 0:34:49| and they said, you know what, we did business with this company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=2089)|
| 0:34:52| We did business with this company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=2092)|
| 0:34:54| These companies started contacting us and said, we did business with ImagePoint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=2094)|
| 0:34:58| What do you know about what's going on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=2098)|
| 0:35:01| In a very short period of time, I think we had 12 to 14 different companies contacted us at that point in time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=2101)|
| 0:35:09| Ten of those companies have now announced and opened offices and facilities here in the Knoxville area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=2109)|
| 0:35:16| They're not up to the same employment numbers, obviously, that ImagePoint was as a corporate headquarters,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=2116)|
| 0:35:22| but there are 145 of those people that were former employees that we are aware of with ImagePoint| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=2122)|
| 0:35:29| that are now working for these sign companies here in the region.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=2129)|
| 0:35:37| Some of our programs, I talked about workforce and education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=2137)|
| 0:35:41| Go ahead, Bill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=2141)|
| 0:35:43| We really believe that workforce plus education equals the future and the success of this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=2143)|
| 0:35:49| We have been involved in a couple of initiatives,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=2149)|
| 0:35:51| and I'm going to go through several of these target programs areas pretty quickly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=2151)|
| 0:35:55| but educators in the workplace on in-service day here for Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=2155)|
| 0:36:00| we had 500 teachers who went into private businesses and spent their in-service day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=2160)|
| 0:36:06| learning to understand how STEM courses or science, technology, engineering, and math| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=2166)|
| 0:36:11| that they are working to teach in their schools can be used in the real world.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=2171)|
| 0:36:16| How can they show the relationship to their students and how these important skills can be used?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=2176)|
| 0:36:22| Working with our underutilized workers, such as our disabled vets, our soldiers who are returning back,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=2182)|
| 0:36:28| different community-wide initiatives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=2188)|
| 0:36:30| The workforce summit that was in 08, we had 600 different folks participate in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=2190)|
| 0:36:35| Last year at Fulton High School, we had a graduation summit on a Saturday morning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=2195)|
| 0:36:40| where we had about 300 people in attendance to celebrate the graduation and then save our future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=2200)|
| 0:36:46| That's a video that with help from River Media was produced,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=2206)|
| 0:36:50| and if you haven't seen this or would like a copy of it, let me know and I'll be sure and get you a copy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=2210)|
| 0:36:56| But education is a community issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=2216)|
| 0:36:58| and it shows you how if you take 100 graduates and you break it down through the process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=2218)|
| 0:37:03| how many of them will be successful and go through college and into the workplace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=2223)|
| 0:37:07| It's a pretty powerful video when you see those numbers to work on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=2227)|
| 0:37:13| Our Director of Workforce and Development, Jennifer Evans,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=2233)|
| 0:37:16| was instrumental and actually almost like a United Way-loaned executive with Dr. McIntyre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=2236)|
| 0:37:22| and helped to write the five-year strategic plan that has been implemented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=2242)|
| 0:37:27| The education management information system is something that the school system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=2247)|
| 0:37:32| with private sector help from the Chamber, has developed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=2252)|
| 0:37:36| to really put together a data warehouse center where you can look at the different functions of the school system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=2256)|
| 0:37:41| and see where the needs are so that we can all better understand as a community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=2261)|
| 0:37:45| where the dollars that are being appropriated to school systems, are they really being utilized?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=2265)|
| 0:37:50| If we don't know what we need, then where do we need to spend the money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=2270)|
| 0:37:53| in order to get success from the school systems that we need?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=2273)|
| 0:37:56| And we're very excited to see that Tennessee was one of the two states chosen in the Race to the Top program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=2276)|
| 0:38:02| So several things in education that we're very involved in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=2282)|
| 0:38:07| Technology and entrepreneurship.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=2287)|
| 0:38:09| The only new person that was hired in the entire Innovation Valley new funding program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=2289)|
| 0:38:14| was the Director of Technology.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=2294)|
| 0:38:16| That person is on staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=2296)|
| 0:38:18| He is very specifically engaged with the Oak Ridge National Laboratory and Y-12.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=2298)|
| 0:38:23| We have targeted sectors, as you can see on the screen, in these defined areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=2303)|
| 0:38:27| And through a LUX study that we did, we now have companies in each of these defined areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=2307)|
| 0:38:32| that we know might consider an expansion or a relocation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=2312)|
| 0:38:35| and we are going after those companies to make that happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=2315)|
| 0:38:38| The tech teams that are involved include folks from the Oak Ridge National Laboratory,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=2318)|
| 0:38:42| Y-12, economic development partners in the private sectors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=2322)|
| 0:38:46| Well, how do you stay out there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=2326)|
| 0:38:48| You've got to be in front of these people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=2328)|
| 0:38:49| You've got to market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=2329)|
| 0:38:50| You've got to advertise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=2330)|
| 0:38:51| You've got to constantly work to make them aware that Knoxville is on their radar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=2331)|
| 0:38:56| You've got some examples in front of that in the package in front of what we're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=2336)|
| 0:39:01| One of the push cards that we use, Green Things Grow in the Valley,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=2341)|
| 0:39:05| and looking at working on different types of solar companies, direct mail pieces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=2345)|
| 0:39:11| Those are examples of some of the ads that we have used in our marketing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=2351)|
| 0:39:17| And on the next slide, some of the very specific pieces that we market in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=2357)|
| 0:39:22| and really get to are Chief Executive Magazine, Solar Today, Automotive News.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=2362)|
| 0:39:28| These are not just a fluke.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=2368)|
| 0:39:29| We do these because we know that we can go and look at the metrics, look at the analytics,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=2369)|
| 0:39:34| and see how many people are really taking a look at these ads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=2374)|
| 0:39:38| And then when they look at these ads, we can count and see where they go to the Knoxville Oak Ridge website.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=2378)|
| 0:39:44| And then we can really go back and focus and see what targets| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=2384)|
| 0:39:47| and what areas in the country that people are looking for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=2387)|
| 0:39:51| We were very pleased last year at Governor Bredesen's Economic Development Conference| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=2391)|
| 0:39:55| that our website received the first annual LinkedIn Outstanding Economic Development Website Award.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=2395)|
| 0:40:02| And we were totally surprised about that but very honored.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=2402)|
| 0:40:05| And it was specifically designed for job recruitment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=2405)|
| 0:40:09| Some of the trade shows also included in that marketing are listed there in front of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=2409)|
| 0:40:14| Cornet Global, RETEC, Renewable Energy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=2414)|
| 0:40:17| I know you guys are jealous that you don't get to go spend a lot of time at Renewable Energy World.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=2417)|
| 0:40:23| But these are the people who are making decisions about where some of these next facilities are going to go,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=2423)|
| 0:40:28| and we want them to look here in our area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=2428)|
| 0:40:31| Existing industry, we did a blitz back on a cold day in December and called on over 100 local companies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=2431)|
| 0:40:37| It rained, it snowed, and we had great success in just getting out in front of people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=2437)|
| 0:40:43| You have in your package a card that shows we want our existing companies to know if you need help,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=2443)|
| 0:40:51| if you need a contact at the city, who do you need to call, we'll help you with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=2451)|
| 0:40:55| We'll make sure if you need a stop sign put in place that got knocked down that you know where to go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=2455)|
| 0:41:00| because you'd be really surprised how much a street sign can impact a company's business sometimes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=2460)|
| 0:41:06| Our Mentor-Protege Program, we have 19 business executives here in the area who are mentoring 19,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=2466)|
| 0:41:16| well, 15 or 19 different companies here in small business, minority businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=2476)|
| 0:41:23| Out of those, this is a new program that we just launched several months ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=2483)|
| 0:41:27| and there are three of those companies that now have million-dollar-plus contracts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=2487)|
| 0:41:31| with other service providers or companies here because the connections were made| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=2491)|
| 0:41:35| and they can now grow their businesses here in our area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=2495)|
| 0:41:39| Public policy, I mentioned that a few minutes ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=2499)|
| 0:41:43| One of the things that we did was make sure that the Empowerment Zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=2503)|
| 0:41:46| and Tennessee Jobs Tax Credit was something that we could use in downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=2506)|
| 0:41:51| It was kind of fuzzy in the state language on that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=2511)|
| 0:41:54| and we had a company that we were working with that we wanted to make sure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=2514)|
| 0:41:57| if that happened, that it was applicable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=2517)|
| 0:42:00| And the Emerging Industry Tax Credit for new types of companies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=2520)|
| 0:42:05| State incentives, which is something that Tennessee relies on a lot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=2525)|
| 0:42:09| have always traditionally been geared toward manufacturing and big box operations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=2529)|
| 0:42:14| And we want the state legislature and the folks at the state ECD office to understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=2534)|
| 0:42:20| that while that was good in the past, that's not the type of companies that we're seeing as many of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=2540)|
| 0:42:25| We still like to see the large manufacturing operations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=2545)|
| 0:42:28| but we also want small companies with 25 or so jobs that have high-paying salaries| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=2548)|
| 0:42:34| to be able to take advantage of some of those tax credits as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=2554)|
| 0:42:38| I mentioned earlier resources for living, air quality roads, flights at McGee-Tyson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=2558)|
| 0:42:44| These are all the types of things that we work on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=2564)|
| 0:42:47| And then the last slide that I have for you is our current project list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=2567)|
| 0:42:52| Right now we have 29 active projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=2572)|
| 0:42:54| You can see the breakdown of these projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=2574)|
| 0:42:57| If they all hit, you know, and that's a big if,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=2577)|
| 0:43:01| but that's the game that we go into playing is that we're going to win and not be eliminated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=2581)|
| 0:43:06| Those ten projects would require 430 total acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=2586)|
| 0:43:10| They would also, if they went into space, they would need between three and a half,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=2590)|
| 0:43:16| four and a half million square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=2596)|
| 0:43:18| But again, if we win, you've got a potential of over $1.25 billion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=2598)|
| 0:43:23| in investment and almost 8,000 jobs in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=2603)|
| 0:43:27| We would love to take you on an existing industry visit with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=2607)|
| 0:43:31| We would love to set those up with you any time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=2611)|
| 0:43:34| We'll find, or if you know of a company in your district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=2614)|
| 0:43:37| or anywhere in the area that you'd like to go and visit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=2617)|
| 0:43:40| if you will just give Doug or I a call, we'll make sure that happens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=2620)|
| 0:43:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=2625)|
| 0:43:48| Okay, I'll try to keep moving quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=2628)|
| 0:43:49| We've got a lot to do, obviously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=2629)|
| 0:43:51| I do want to add one thing, and that we have a terrific relationship with the Chamber,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=2631)|
| 0:43:56| and I think they do a great job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=2636)|
| 0:43:58| And we have a very cooperative relationship, and it's all intertwined.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=2638)|
| 0:44:02| Just as an example, when Green Mountain Coffee was looking here, we got a call one time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=2642)|
| 0:44:07| hey, you all have an energy and sustainability program here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=2647)|
| 0:44:10| and we'd like to talk to you about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=2650)|
| 0:44:13| And Madeline Weil spent a lot of time with them, two very long meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=2653)|
| 0:44:16| because they were very interested in the type of community that we were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=2656)|
| 0:44:19| and the community values that that program articulated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=2659)|
| 0:44:23| So that turned out, I can't say that was a defining role,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=2663)|
| 0:44:26| but it's part of the whole package that folks look at that means it works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=2666)|
| 0:44:30| There are a lot of moving parts that touch in terms of getting folks to come here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=2670)|
| 0:44:35| Okay, what our challenge is, I'm going to go back to, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=2675)|
| 0:44:38| with the city government perspective on that, is when we try to encourage development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=2678)|
| 0:44:44| and I'm going to work, we're moving a little bit from job recruitment to development now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=2684)|
| 0:44:48| And the idea that we have is oftentimes we think it's in the city's interest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=2688)|
| 0:44:53| for development to occur in a certain place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=2693)|
| 0:44:56| Hopefully we want the kind of development we have in mind as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=2696)|
| 0:45:00| We want it to be in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=2700)|
| 0:45:02| We've got minimal open space remaining.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=2702)|
| 0:45:04| There's difficulty in profitability having to do with rehabbing old structures,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=2704)|
| 0:45:09| and we've had to facilitate private sector investment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=2709)|
| 0:45:12| That's consistent with the goals of the city and the values of the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=2712)|
| 0:45:16| Sometimes that's easy to articulate, and sometimes it's not so easy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=2716)|
| 0:45:22| But when we need to often encourage development, and we do that mainly with incentives| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=2722)|
| 0:45:27| that I had up there earlier in the slides, and the challenge is putting the right tools in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=2727)|
| 0:45:32| Those of you who were on the previous council remember that in 2004 we had a workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=2732)|
| 0:45:38| It started off a lot like this, and then the challenge was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=2738)|
| 0:45:41| how do we get a nice, consistent, predictable, understandable process?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=2741)|
| 0:45:46| What I said at that time is we had a lot of things going,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=2746)|
| 0:45:49| but we needed to get beyond what I called the adhocracy or what people thought it was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=2749)|
| 0:45:52| Well, how do you know about these things?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=2752)|
| 0:45:54| And can everybody apply for them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=2754)|
| 0:45:56| And how are they evaluated?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=2756)|
| 0:45:58| That seemed to be a big fog out there that sometimes what the city's use of tools seemed to cut through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=2758)|
| 0:46:05| And that's one thing we worked on a lot with city council and had a lot of discussions with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=2765)|
| 0:46:09| and we prepared a whole series of ways to deal with people who were interested so it was very predictable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=2769)|
| 0:46:17| And I encourage you, if you haven't been, to go to our website, and all of that's on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=2777)|
| 0:46:20| The other thing we believe in is absolute and total transparency and participation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=2780)|
| 0:46:25| Every meeting, every discussion, still the downtown north meetings are still on there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=2785)|
| 0:46:28| and some people go back and look through those, and they're pretty interesting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=2788)|
| 0:46:31| All of our criteria, all of our projects, there isn't a city in Tennessee that I'm aware of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=2791)|
| 0:46:36| that makes public all the projects that are being supported by incentives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=2796)|
| 0:46:40| We put all of our TIF projects on there when they were, what the project is, the history, and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=2800)|
| 0:46:45| And the more of that you build community confidence, you build confidence in a process we've established,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=2805)|
| 0:46:51| and I think that's critical.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=2811)|
| 0:46:53| We have things that limit our role, and I'm going to brush through these real quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=2813)|
| 0:46:57| Basically, the main thing is we as a city, the main thing we have is tax policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=2817)|
| 0:47:01| And that plays out in two ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=2821)|
| 0:47:04| We have a payment in lieu of taxes, which basically is figuring out a way where a company can have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=2824)|
| 0:47:10| or somebody we recruit, it can be for industrial reasons or other, can pay a reduced level of taxes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=2830)|
| 0:47:16| and then the burden is off of them, and they're pro forma for their business development is one that works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=2836)|
| 0:47:23| Another is using taxes but directing them toward public projects, and that's tax increment financing, or TIFs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=2843)|
| 0:47:32| I think I'm speaking a little quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=2852)|
| 0:47:34| I'm getting a few looks like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=2854)|
| 0:47:35| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=2855)|
| 0:47:36| The time pressures are taking over here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=2856)|
| 0:47:39| And basically we have to use tools like this because we don't have the capacity to take before you as a council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=2859)|
| 0:47:46| let's reduce these folks' taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=2866)|
| 0:47:48| That's not an option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=2868)|
| 0:47:50| The Constitution of Tennessee forbids that on a case-by-case basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=2870)|
| 0:47:55| And so these tools are developed in such a way by the state, by the General Assembly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=2875)|
| 0:48:00| for cities to use that are consistent with that constitutional provision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=2880)|
| 0:48:04| and we'll explain how that works in a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=2884)|
| 0:48:08| One of those development partners we work with is KCDC, and they help us through redevelopment areas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=2888)|
| 0:48:14| which allow two things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=2894)|
| 0:48:16| They allow the incentive of tax increment financing has to be that there's a slight exception to this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=2896)|
| 0:48:23| which we can get into, but I don't really want to spend much time on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=2903)|
| 0:48:26| But most of our tax increment financing is through KCDC in redevelopment areas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=2906)|
| 0:48:32| and this is one of our major tools that we've brought before you many, many times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=2912)|
| 0:48:38| The other thing that KCDC can provide us through redevelopment areas is the ability to use eminent domain to remove blight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=2918)|
| 0:48:47| and it's something we have tried to use exceedingly sparingly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=2927)|
| 0:48:50| But that stick being out there with the carrot of the tax policy is always good to have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=2930)|
| 0:48:55| because sometimes we want to push for new development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=2935)|
| 0:48:58| and others we really want folks to just improve what they have and clean up what they have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=2938)|
| 0:49:03| And many times we've found that just having that out there is very important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=2943)|
| 0:49:10| The way this works, basically the redevelopment area is something that council approves being set up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=2950)|
| 0:49:17| and the boundaries for, then we have a pretty extensive public process where people can know what's out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=2957)|
| 0:49:22| and why it's being set up, and again, we did that with Downtown North.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=2962)|
| 0:49:25| It's got to have its purposes, and then any project that comes up there has to come before council as that moves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=2965)|
| 0:49:32| So KCDC is a critical partner of ours, especially as we do tax increment financing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=2972)|
| 0:49:39| Examples of that, Brown Low School I mentioned before was a very important TIF project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=2979)|
| 0:49:44| that helped in the extension out of Downtown North and beyond,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=2984)|
| 0:49:48| and one that really had some real pluses for a neighborhood as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=2988)|
| 0:49:52| And we have a TIF district as a possibility, and we have that for the South Waterfront.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=2992)|
| 0:49:56| So that's part of our toolbox through KCDC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=2996)|
| 0:49:59| The other development partner we have is the Industrial Development Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=2999)|
| 0:50:03| Look, two things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=3003)|
| 0:50:04| You're actually ahead of schedule, so don't panic on time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=3004)|
| 0:50:07| But second, can you go back and explain the difference between a TIF project and a TIF district?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=3007)|
| 0:50:13| Sure. Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=3013)|
| 0:50:14| A TIF project is when an individual development that would not otherwise work through an application process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=3014)|
| 0:50:23| the taxes, the increment means the increase in taxes produced by that development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=3023)|
| 0:50:29| a substantial portion of that can be directed back into the financing of that development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=3029)|
| 0:50:35| That being, let's take the Holston was a huge one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=3035)|
| 0:50:38| Right now it's on the tax rolls, or previously on the tax rolls at $600,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=3038)|
| 0:50:44| or I think, Bob, you may even have what it was, but it's pre-state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=3044)|
| 0:50:49| And we estimate, well, once it's all developed according to what a developer wants to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=3049)|
| 0:50:54| it's going to produce millions of dollars of taxes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=3054)|
| 0:50:58| then we can take a proportion of that new taxes and have it directed back to retire alone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=3058)|
| 0:51:06| part of their loan and part of their financial package.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=3066)|
| 0:51:08| And I'll get into how that works in a minute if we have time, but that's a TIF project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=3068)|
| 0:51:15| A TIF district is when you have a defined area that all increases anywhere in that defined area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=3075)|
| 0:51:23| in taxes that occur over time can be directed back into infrastructure to support that area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=3083)|
| 0:51:29| not to the projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=3089)|
| 0:51:30| And the South Water Fund is our example of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=3090)|
| 0:51:34| That is, we anticipated a tremendous amount of economic growth in the South Water Fund| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=3094)|
| 0:51:39| and then therefore increased property taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=3099)|
| 0:51:42| Those property taxes that come from that, we've promised to go back into infrastructure to support that development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=3102)|
| 0:51:50| So it's really taking increases in taxes to an area for roads, streets, and so forth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=3110)|
| 0:51:58| or any infrastructure connected with the area rather than to any specific project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=3118)|
| 0:52:03| And one thing that, interestingly enough, comes up is once you do a TIF district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=3123)|
| 0:52:07| you've already got the taxes taken care of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=3127)|
| 0:52:10| If somebody in a TIF district comes and says, hey, we'd like some for a project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=3130)|
| 0:52:13| you have to say, sorry, those taxes are already accounted for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=3133)|
| 0:52:16| and what it's doing is adding value for you as a developer through the improvement in the infrastructure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=3136)|
| 0:52:23| So that's the difference between the two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=3143)|
| 0:52:27| The Industrial Development Board, this is another entity set up by the State General Assembly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=3147)|
| 0:52:35| to promote industry, trade, and commerce,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=3155)|
| 0:52:37| and it is the vehicle through which we can set up something called payment in lieu of taxes, or a pilot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=3157)|
| 0:52:43| And the way, basically, if the goal is to say, well, here is a project that comes along,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=3163)|
| 0:52:49| and this project, we want it to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=3169)|
| 0:52:52| It's in the city's interest for it to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=3172)|
| 0:52:55| We make that case to you as council, and you would hopefully see that you would agree with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=3175)|
| 0:53:01| And we'll call it a pilot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=3181)|
| 0:53:03| The way that would work is the person doing the development would say, this will work for me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=3183)|
| 0:53:09| if I don't have the burden of all the taxes that this project will produce.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=3189)|
| 0:53:13| Then I can make it work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=3193)|
| 0:53:16| Otherwise, it won't work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=3196)|
| 0:53:17| That's overcoming the development gap.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=3197)|
| 0:53:19| And that's different from a TIF, because in a TIF, the taxes are paid,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=3199)|
| 0:53:23| but they go back into paying for the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=3203)|
| 0:53:26| In a pilot, they just aren't paid at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=3206)|
| 0:53:28| Now, a lot of times folks ask, well, when would you use a pilot or a TIF?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=3208)|
| 0:53:34| Well, the ideal time to use a TIF is you're a developer, you're going to do a project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=3214)|
| 0:53:39| Let's take the Holston, for example, or you could take Brownlow School Lofts or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=3219)|
| 0:53:43| And once you build that, those are sold and the buyer pays the taxes to help repay the developer's loan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=3223)|
| 0:53:52| So that's much better for the developer than if they're sold and no taxes are collected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=3232)|
| 0:53:58| That doesn't work if no taxes are collected, because the developer is not going to get those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=3238)|
| 0:54:02| and it's not going to help make that project work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=3242)|
| 0:54:05| So a pilot works if the developer is going to hold on to the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=3245)|
| 0:54:09| And that's why when we took the Jackson Avenue apartments to you a few weeks ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=3249)|
| 0:54:13| that was meant to be retained, ownership to be retained, and it was much simpler to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=3253)|
| 0:54:18| well, you could set up a process by which you paid taxes and then they paid off your loan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=3258)|
| 0:54:24| or you could just say, well, you're not going to have the burden of those taxes anyway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=3264)|
| 0:54:28| so you need a smaller loan, and it just makes it easier for everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=3268)|
| 0:54:31| So those are the two tools that we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=3271)|
| 0:54:35| I guess, Bob, if you want to go to the next one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=3275)|
| 0:54:38| Now, how that works briefly, and we'll be able to go into as much detail as you want at another time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=3278)|
| 0:54:45| is, again, as I said, this has got to be understandable, consistent, fair, and public and transparent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=3285)|
| 0:54:53| So what our process we follow is a very structured one and a very disciplined one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=3293)|
| 0:54:58| We have a group within the city of Deputy to the Mayor Martin is a key member of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=3298)|
| 0:55:05| I am, Bob Wetzel, and others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=3305)|
| 0:55:09| Then we're on a project basis where if somebody comes to us, we ask them to fill out an application,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=3309)|
| 0:55:14| all of these run through our department, and that says, and sometimes with community development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=3314)|
| 0:55:20| that says, here's a project, it doesn't work unless I have one of these tax abatement or tax tools to use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=3320)|
| 0:55:27| And the first question we have to do is show us that there really is a gap.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=3327)|
| 0:55:33| It just can't be, hey, I'm going to build this, and rather than making a little money, I want to make a lot of money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=3333)|
| 0:55:38| That's not compelling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=3338)|
| 0:55:40| It's got to be this project doesn't work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=3340)|
| 0:55:42| That's what we call the but-for test.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=3342)|
| 0:55:44| It isn't going to happen unless we use this tool.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=3344)|
| 0:55:46| So we look at that, and we then send it out to a third-party banker to see whether, in fact, that is, in fact, the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=3346)|
| 0:55:54| That is, review their assumptions, how much it would cost, what they're likely to sell this for per square foot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=3354)|
| 0:56:00| what rental they're likely to get.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=3360)|
| 0:56:02| And then we make a decision, and we oftentimes stop at that point and go, we're not convinced of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=3362)|
| 0:56:07| The second thing we do is the public benefit test, which is, well, a lot of times if it doesn't work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=3367)|
| 0:56:14| the market's probably telling you it doesn't need to work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=3374)|
| 0:56:16| So why should the city get involved in having it work?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=3376)|
| 0:56:18| And that's when it's really in the city's interest to get this to go, and we have to identify that public benefit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=3378)|
| 0:56:24| Sometimes it's really easy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=3384)|
| 0:56:26| This building is falling apart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=3386)|
| 0:56:28| It's a fire hazard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=3388)|
| 0:56:30| It's impossible to develop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=3390)|
| 0:56:31| Nothing good is going to happen in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=3391)|
| 0:56:33| It will be a magnet for crime.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=3393)|
| 0:56:35| If it turns around, it will be a plus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=3395)|
| 0:56:37| It will be a plus for the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=3397)|
| 0:56:39| Perfect example again, Brown Low School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=3399)|
| 0:56:40| That was a negative to 4th and Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=3400)|
| 0:56:42| Now we want to make it a neutral positive, not to mention to restore a historic school and save an historic building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=3402)|
| 0:56:50| These are all important pluses that go into that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=3410)|
| 0:56:54| So we have what we call the but-for test and the public interest test,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=3414)|
| 0:56:58| and we have a discipline that we run everything through, and then we will then, if they pass both of these,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=3418)|
| 0:57:04| we'll continue with the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=3424)|
| 0:57:07| So what we have in terms of our partners, again, we work with community development very closely internally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=3427)|
| 0:57:13| We work with KCDC in redevelopment areas, mainly for tax increment financing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=3433)|
| 0:57:18| We work with the IDB on pilots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=3438)|
| 0:57:20| They do not have to be in redevelopment areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=3440)|
| 0:57:22| We work with the Chamber on business recruitment and retention,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=3442)|
| 0:57:25| Development Corporation on facilitating projects along with the Chamber.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=3445)|
| 0:57:30| Obviously, the MPC on land use and on public projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=3450)|
| 0:57:35| The cinema is an example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=3455)|
| 0:57:37| One of our partners is the PBA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=3457)|
| 0:57:39| I can go briefly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=3459)|
| 0:57:42| I don't know if you want to get into briefly how a pilot works and how a TIF works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=3462)|
| 0:57:46| I'll leave that up to you to counsel, or you want to move on to MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=3466)|
| 0:57:50| It's your pleasure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=3470)|
| 0:57:55| Well, I mean, figuring we go to 630, we have a little bit of time left here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=3475)|
| 0:58:02| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=3482)|
| 0:58:03| Sure, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=3483)|
| 0:58:04| Anybody object, let's go for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=3484)|
| 0:58:08| Strut, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=3488)|
| 0:58:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=3489)|
| 0:58:12| I'll start with the pilot, a payment in lieu of taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=3492)|
| 0:58:15| These are possible inside and outside redevelopment areas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=3495)|
| 0:58:18| and basically tax abatement, that may not be the exact legal term I ought to use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=3498)|
| 0:58:24| but basically I mean by that taxes will be reduced by a certain amount over a period of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=3504)|
| 0:58:30| So the way this works is if we think this is a fitting, there's a fitting use for the tool,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=3510)|
| 0:58:39| and we would prepare a situation by which in order for that tax to be reduced,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=3519)|
| 0:58:45| we're not actually reducing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=3525)|
| 0:58:47| What we're doing is providing that property to the Industrial Development Board to own for that period of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=3527)|
| 0:58:54| And that means it's off the tax rolls because it's owned by a public entity and not taxable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=3534)|
| 0:59:00| That's basically the way you get around just reducing the taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=3540)|
| 0:59:03| You provide it to a non-taxable entity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=3543)|
| 0:59:06| And then you might say, well, what is the payment in lieu of?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=3546)|
| 0:59:09| Well, that is negotiable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=3549)|
| 0:59:11| That is rent that can be paid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=3551)|
| 0:59:13| It's called rent, but what we're saying is, okay, you're not paying taxes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=3553)|
| 0:59:18| but depending on what's negotiated, there is an amount that we want you to pay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=3558)|
| 0:59:24| For instance, on the Jackson Avenue apartments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=3564)|
| 0:59:27| we negotiated an amount that is equal to the debt retirement portion of the budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=3567)|
| 0:59:33| which comes into play on TIFs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=3573)|
| 0:59:36| That doesn't always have to apply.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=3576)|
| 0:59:38| If Rhonda and the Chamber bring in an entity that, let's say we work with Riley Foods,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=3578)|
| 0:59:45| another important company that we part retention and part expansion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=3585)|
| 0:59:50| what we worked out there was really what do we need to do to get them here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=3590)|
| 0:59:54| It could be a minimal payment there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=3594)|
| 0:59:56| It's what's necessary to use this tool to make it possible and profitable for them to stay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=3596)|
| 1:00:01| and operate their business and expand and increase the tax base for their buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=3601)|
| 1:00:06| So the IDB actually takes ownership of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=3606)|
| 1:00:09| They set up a lease.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=3609)|
| 1:00:10| The developer pays the difference over the terms set by the IDB.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=3610)|
| 1:00:14| And after that's all over, it will be provided back to the owner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=3614)|
| 1:00:19| the owner rather than developer, and then the taxes are paid in full.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=3619)|
| 1:00:22| So a pilot, I had one other thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=3622)|
| 1:00:25| There are other taxes and fees are paid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=3625)|
| 1:00:28| The CBID fees are always paid if it's in the CBID,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=3628)|
| 1:00:31| and almost always at least the existing taxes are paid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=3631)|
| 1:00:35| We usually, in fact, don't go back to zero,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=3635)|
| 1:00:37| that is whatever they were before the property was improved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=3637)|
| 1:00:40| So a pilot basically works by turning it over to the IDB.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=3640)|
| 1:00:45| Some people have asked, well, why do pilots not go to commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=3645)|
| 1:00:48| It's because, and we've struggled with that issue of whether these things should go to commission or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=3648)|
| 1:00:56| It's because there's really no decision to be made other than by city council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=3656)|
| 1:01:00| to allow the property to go to the IDB.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=3660)|
| 1:01:04| It's not that commission decides not to collect the taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=3664)|
| 1:01:07| It's just not taxable at that point, and then to the city or to the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=3667)|
| 1:01:11| And that's the reason on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=3671)|
| 1:01:13| Okay, Bob.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=3673)|
| 1:01:14| Now how a TIF works, and let's do more of a project TIF| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=3674)|
| 1:01:17| because that's where most of the southwestern is very significant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=3677)|
| 1:01:20| but it is an exception.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=3680)|
| 1:01:23| A project TIF works when somebody comes in and goes through the same procedure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=3683)|
| 1:01:28| and the same discipline, and what we do is they have to go to a bank and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=3688)|
| 1:01:35| if we approve this, we'll say it's the non-debt retirement proportion of the taxes can be directed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=3695)|
| 1:01:45| and we set up through KCDC this whole process, can be directed back to pay off a loan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=3705)|
| 1:01:52| So the developer comes and they say, well, here is our loan for the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=3712)|
| 1:01:56| It could be any of the ones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=3716)|
| 1:01:59| It could be the candy factory or the Fire Street Lofts was another one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=3719)|
| 1:02:04| Here's the loan for the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=3724)|
| 1:02:05| We also are getting a TIF loan, and we've gotten a bank agreeing to do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=3725)|
| 1:02:10| and that bank is saying, all right, the city and the county, in this case,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=3730)|
| 1:02:14| we go to county commission on this as well as city council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=3734)|
| 1:02:17| are going to say any new taxes realized from this project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=3737)|
| 1:02:20| are going to be directed back to pay off that loan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=3740)|
| 1:02:23| and the bank then understands that process and says, okay, we'll grant that loan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=3743)|
| 1:02:28| That is the portion that makes the project work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=3748)|
| 1:02:32| That's our judgment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=3752)|
| 1:02:33| We need that to make the project work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=3753)|
| 1:02:34| It wouldn't work without it, and it's people who live there who buy the condominiums| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=3754)|
| 1:02:40| or even keep ownership of the building, they pay their taxes like everybody else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=3760)|
| 1:02:44| They don't know the difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=3764)|
| 1:02:46| It's just that Jim York and his office and Larry Martin's,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=3766)|
| 1:02:49| they keep track of this money and direct it to pay off the loans for a period of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=3769)|
| 1:02:54| As you know, we take these projects to council as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=3774)|
| 1:02:57| But what is immediately realized is the debt retirement portion, which is 26%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=3777)|
| 1:03:05| So immediately, if there's a new building, we say the immediate benefit is that 26% of the taxes are paid,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=3785)|
| 1:03:12| and that's above what the base was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=3792)|
| 1:03:14| So whenever we do a TIF, there are new taxes coming in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=3794)|
| 1:03:17| They're just not all the new taxes for that period of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=3797)|
| 1:03:21| Now, I might add, parenthetically, since I've spoken so fast that we've gotten at least not too far behind,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=3801)|
| 1:03:27| all of these things, and we had a great discussion in council about a year ago, as I remember,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=3807)|
| 1:03:33| that got to, well, there's risk involved in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=3813)|
| 1:03:37| There's not perfect knowledge, and the risk profile is basically this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=3817)|
| 1:03:42| We could have granted, say, a TIF and taken to you a TIF, figuring it wouldn't happen otherwise,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=3822)|
| 1:03:48| and maybe it really would have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=3828)|
| 1:03:50| And then we're not getting the tax money, the full 74 extra percent over the 26 for the period of the TIF.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=3830)|
| 1:03:58| We don't really have any way of knowing that, but that's why we've got to be pretty cautious in doing this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=3838)|
| 1:04:03| That's risk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=3843)|
| 1:04:04| The other risk is if we don't do this, if we make the call and nothing happens,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=3844)|
| 1:04:09| that then buildings deteriorate, fires break out, all sorts of things can happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=3849)|
| 1:04:14| The building then four years later, nobody can make it work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=3854)|
| 1:04:17| It's too far gone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=3857)|
| 1:04:18| I mean, there's not enough, there's too much, there's not a gap that would be fundable through the process that we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=3858)|
| 1:04:23| The one way to look at this risk profile is that even if we're four years about into, or five years into a TIF,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=3863)|
| 1:04:34| and maybe it would have happened later, getting it done earlier presents all kinds of benefits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=3874)|
| 1:04:41| the immediate 26 percent occurring earlier, one, and all the other things that happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=3881)|
| 1:04:46| People, the construction, all the economic activity, if there's retail, the retail sales.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=3886)|
| 1:04:51| But we have to evaluate that because what we don't want to do is come to, if at all possible,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=3891)|
| 1:04:57| is provide an incentive that's not needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=3897)|
| 1:05:02| That's something we want to avoid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=3902)|
| 1:05:03| We feel pretty, we feel good, very confident in our process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=3903)|
| 1:05:07| But, I mean, law of probabilities are we well could have missed one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=3907)|
| 1:05:11| And we could have been wrong on one, we turned down two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=3911)|
| 1:05:14| So, you know, who knows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=3914)|
| 1:05:16| Okay, so I guess we're ready to summarize here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=3916)|
| 1:05:20| And then I guess after Mike goes, we'll then have questions on the whole thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=3920)|
| 1:05:24| We've got a lot of tools to use going back and taking the route back up to 60,000 feet again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=3924)|
| 1:05:32| As council, as an administration, as a government,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=3932)|
| 1:05:35| to help direct toward the kind of community we want to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=3935)|
| 1:05:39| And I think the more strategic we are and the more of a vision that we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=3939)|
| 1:05:45| and the more that council and the administration as much as possible can share in this vision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=3945)|
| 1:05:49| we can be incredibly successful at these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=3949)|
| 1:05:52| Again, the capital fund, obviously, do we invest money on a public space or garages?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=3952)|
| 1:05:57| Those come up often.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=3957)|
| 1:05:59| Payment in lieu of taxes, we've had some real successes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=3959)|
| 1:06:02| Riley Foods, a tremendous success in our partnership with the chambers, what enabled that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=3962)|
| 1:06:06| Jackson and Gay is a use of one where it's going to be rental, so ownership will be retained.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=3966)|
| 1:06:11| Tax increment financing projects, Brownlow, Fire Street Lofts, we've got quite a few.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=3971)|
| 1:06:16| Tax increment in financing districts, we used a district briefly for the cinema to close that gap.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=3976)|
| 1:06:22| It paid off, as you know, early and is already now those dollars are going back to the general fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=3982)|
| 1:06:27| And the South Waterfront.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=3987)|
| 1:06:28| So I think our challenge is to make sure that the public retains confidence in these tools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=3988)|
| 1:06:35| and in our use of these tools because it doesn't take many, many, very many mistakes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=3995)|
| 1:06:41| and this happens in many cities, for there to be a movement that goes, okay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=4001)|
| 1:06:45| these are being used irresponsibly, we'll just clamp down on them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=4005)|
| 1:06:49| And I think there are real negatives toward that happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=4009)|
| 1:06:53| So that pretty well, I guess, is all we have to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=4013)|
| 1:06:57| And I will turn it over to Mr. Carberry to go into the other major set of ways we have to encourage development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=4017)|
| 1:07:04| and discourage development, and that's land use policy and zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=4024)|
| 1:07:12| Thank you, Bill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=4032)|
| 1:07:14| We kind of went back to old school and actually have a handout.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=4034)|
| 1:07:19| So it's going to be in front of you here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=4039)|
| 1:07:23| We felt we had quite a bit of material to cover and maybe something you'd like to take home,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=4043)|
| 1:07:28| so we decided to use that approach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=4048)|
| 1:07:31| Jeff Archer, who's also with the comprehensive planning staff, is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=4051)|
| 1:07:34| He helped put this together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=4054)|
| 1:07:37| I'm going to talk about some existing tools and about some new tools that you will be seeing in the form of ordinances,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=4057)|
| 1:07:47| basically, in the next year or two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=4067)|
| 1:07:50| And so the first of these I'd like to talk about is form-based codes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=4070)|
| 1:07:57| And so if you turn the page over, I'm going to give a brief overview of the difference between conventional zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=4077)|
| 1:08:06| and form-based codes, because I think some of you are new to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=4086)|
| 1:08:12| And I'd like to look at sort of three eras of Knoxville's zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=4092)|
| 1:08:18| In 1929, Knoxville had its first zoning ordinance and general plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=4098)|
| 1:08:25| It's online if you want to see it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=4105)|
| 1:08:27| It's by Harlan Bartholomew and Associates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=4107)|
| 1:08:30| Excellent, excellent planning work for that era.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=4110)|
| 1:08:34| And prior to that, everything was trolley-based as far as emerging suburban areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=4114)|
| 1:08:42| So the automobile didn't figure much into the early zoning ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=4122)|
| 1:08:47| It wasn't until after World War II, which I would say is the second era,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=4127)|
| 1:08:52| and we began to have highway systems that went out to what is the suburbs then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=4132)|
| 1:09:01| and suburban shopping centers and those kinds of things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=4141)|
| 1:09:06| that we began to introduce new building forms and new parking standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=4146)|
| 1:09:11| And that's what I want to be talking about in the first few minutes here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=4151)|
| 1:09:15| That 1950s code sort of turned the clock back on tradition to where, for instance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=4155)|
| 1:09:25| in the old portions of the city, 4th and Gill and out east, south,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=4165)|
| 1:09:33| no longer could one essentially do a house on a 50-foot lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=4173)|
| 1:09:42| The new code said 75-foot wide lots throughout central or all of Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=4182)|
| 1:09:47| whether it be urban or suburban.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=4187)|
| 1:09:50| Another thing we don't have on here is an ordinance that you're going to see called R1HK,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=4190)|
| 1:09:55| which does turn the clock back to recognize those kinds of older neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=4195)|
| 1:10:00| It's sort of like infill housing to some degree,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=4200)|
| 1:10:04| but it could recognize that need in the heart of Knoxville, the area inside 640.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=4204)|
| 1:10:12| So the other thing that happened in this second era was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=4212)|
| 1:10:17| there wasn't an interstate highway system here until the late 60s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=4217)|
| 1:10:22| And so North Central Street, Magnolia, Kingston Pike, Asheville Highway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=4222)|
| 1:10:29| Chapman Highway were all these conduits out of town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=4229)|
| 1:10:34| And North Central, for instance, which you can see in this lower photograph under street layout,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=4234)|
| 1:10:40| was widened from two lanes to five lanes in many sections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=4240)|
| 1:10:46| Now it's way over capacity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=4246)|
| 1:10:50| There's only about 11,000 trips on there per day after the interstate went through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=4250)|
| 1:10:55| But it was an era where we were trying to get people through town or out of town,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=4255)|
| 1:10:59| and now the goal with a lot of this work is how do we retain people in town| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=4259)|
| 1:11:05| and attract people to the central core of the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=4265)|
| 1:11:10| So let's go to the next page, and we'll talk about some of the basics of form code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=4270)|
| 1:11:15| There's already a code for South Waterfront as part of the zoning ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=4275)|
| 1:11:23| and we've been working with the city, its law department, policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=4283)|
| 1:11:30| We've reorganized the zoning code to have a whole section that will accept the form codes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=4290)|
| 1:11:37| Waiting in the wings for new form codes is Cumberland Avenue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=4297)|
| 1:11:41| which you'll see probably in the next six, eight months,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=4301)|
| 1:11:45| and then it's going to be North Central and downtown north, and then the West Magnolia area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=4305)|
| 1:11:54| There's quite a few differences between conventional zoning and form codes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=4314)|
| 1:12:02| First of all, when we talk about form, it's the volume of the building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=4322)|
| 1:12:08| and perhaps such things as windows and door openings and those kinds of things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=4328)|
| 1:12:14| in relation to the street and the lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=4334)|
| 1:12:19| It's aiming toward more uniformity in the street setting with built-to lines| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=4339)|
| 1:12:27| and locations for parking and those kinds of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=4347)|
| 1:12:31| It also is less controlling as far as use and allows a mix of use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=4351)|
| 1:12:38| It might point in certain districts where it's Cumberland Avenue, for instance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=4358)|
| 1:12:44| where it should be retail on the ground floor and then it could be office or residential up above,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=4364)|
| 1:12:50| but it does allow a mix of use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=4370)|
| 1:12:55| And that's what we as planners refer to as the private realm, what happens beyond the street right-of-way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=4375)|
| 1:13:03| Also really important in this, because you want to set the address and set the setting for the development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=4383)|
| 1:13:09| is what happens in the public realm,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=4389)|
| 1:13:11| and that's where you've seen the drawings of what's going to happen on Cumberland Avenue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=4391)|
| 1:13:17| with wider sidewalks and street trees and those kinds of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=4397)|
| 1:13:20| That's the public realm, and that's where generally it's the city that would have the responsibility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=4400)|
| 1:13:27| to make those improvements to foster private investment in the form code area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=4407)|
| 1:13:35| What you see here is an example of the cross-section that was in the Magnolia Corridor plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=4415)|
| 1:13:43| that was recently adopted, looking at the complete street cross-section| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=4423)|
| 1:13:48| for the first part of Magnolia Avenue of how it might appear in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=4428)|
| 1:13:57| Then we're moving to road corridor design and redevelopment tools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=4437)|
| 1:14:03| And this can happen in both fairly, well, mainly in suburban or rural areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=4443)|
| 1:14:14| This concept has been around for quite some time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=4454)|
| 1:14:17| When I use the term overlay, let me give you a couple of examples to put it in context.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=4457)|
| 1:14:25| Knox County has several of the historic districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=4465)|
| 1:14:28| The downtown area has an overlay on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=4468)|
| 1:14:33| The Tech Corridor has an overlay on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=4473)|
| 1:14:36| And overlays do not change the underlying zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=4476)|
| 1:14:40| Whatever is allowed by whatever zone within the overlay, that's perfectly fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=4480)|
| 1:14:46| But it does begin to set parameters as far as design standards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=4486)|
| 1:14:51| in some cases materials as in historic districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=4491)|
| 1:14:56| If a house is lost, what are going to be the standards for new construction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=4496)|
| 1:15:02| within that historic district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=4502)|
| 1:15:05| Examples downtown are signs and awnings and those kinds of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=4505)|
| 1:15:11| So you're really getting at some of these basic aesthetic issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=4511)|
| 1:15:16| and sometimes safety issues with the overlay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=4516)|
| 1:15:20| And it's a means to separate out some distinction between those areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=4520)|
| 1:15:26| and more conventional areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=4526)|
| 1:15:28| When we worked on the East County Sector Plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=4528)|
| 1:15:32| and we've heard this in some of the other more rural sectors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=4532)|
| 1:15:35| is we don't want to be like Kingston Pike and like West Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=4535)|
| 1:15:39| And there are some very scenic qualities to Asheville Highway still.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=4539)|
| 1:15:46| Portions of John Sevier Highway are scenic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=4546)|
| 1:15:50| Other portions, like the before picture here, are less so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=4550)|
| 1:15:55| But the idea here, and we've begun work on an ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=4555)|
| 1:16:00| that would allow these kinds of corridors and overlays,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=4560)|
| 1:16:05| is you would get at lighting standards, perhaps signage standards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=4565)|
| 1:16:11| more uniformity in signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=4571)|
| 1:16:13| I think we've all been to communities where there might be a consistent height in the sign| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=4573)|
| 1:16:18| or it might be monument signs, consistency in landscape.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=4578)|
| 1:16:22| It's a way of unifying and beautifying the sense of place along a corridor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=4582)|
| 1:16:28| And that's where we're heading as far as the highway overlay corridors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=4588)|
| 1:16:36| Then I want to touch upon urban and suburban parking standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=4596)|
| 1:16:46| And there's two aspects of this that we're looking at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=4606)|
| 1:16:52| One is in the heart of Knoxville and more urban settings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=4612)|
| 1:16:57| And the other is we recognize that even in suburbia, there's massive parking lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=4617)|
| 1:17:04| You can go to Dean Hill Center, any Home Depot site, any Walmart site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=4624)|
| 1:17:10| and you can see a sea of asphalt virtually any time of the year that's underutilized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=4630)|
| 1:17:16| And several cities have recognized that that's a redevelopment opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=4636)|
| 1:17:22| Home Depot went so far in an article that we're quoting there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=4642)|
| 1:17:27| They're proposing out-parcel development on 50 of their Home Depot sites.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=4647)|
| 1:17:33| That was also in the Sentinel back in November.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=4653)|
| 1:17:36| So they like the idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=4656)|
| 1:17:39| The private sector is sometimes interested in this as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=4659)|
| 1:17:43| So that gets at this over-parking, if you will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=4663)|
| 1:17:47| Right now the Knoxville standard for a shopping center is 4.5 parking spaces per thousand square feet of leaseable floor area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=4667)|
| 1:17:59| in other words, the size of the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=4679)|
| 1:18:01| And we've anecdotally begun to look around town to say, well, wait a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=4681)|
| 1:18:06| We already have situations where the parking works pretty darn well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=4686)|
| 1:18:12| And the one we have in the corner there is the Food City Bearden Shopping Center at North Shore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=4692)|
| 1:18:23| As you're coming to North Shore when heading west on Kingston Pike, that's only 2.5 spaces per thousand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=4703)|
| 1:18:31| And I think you can go in there virtually any time and find a space without a great deal of difficulty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=4711)|
| 1:18:41| If we turn to the next page, another example is when Home Depot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=4721)|
| 1:18:50| and I'm sure most of you are familiar with this case, wanted to redevelop the Target site in Fountain City,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=4730)|
| 1:18:56| we began to talk about the existing landscape there and the trees that Target planted 20-something years ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=4736)|
| 1:19:05| and said, you know, let's try to work around these things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=4745)|
| 1:19:09| It doesn't need to be completely cleared.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=4749)|
| 1:19:12| And 4.5 spaces probably is something you should reconsider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=4752)|
| 1:19:18| And they did. They came back with 3.5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=4758)|
| 1:19:22| I went there on Christmas Eve, and I know that had to be one of the high-volume days of the year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=4762)|
| 1:19:29| and had no problem finding a parking space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=4769)|
| 1:19:32| So we really feel that these standards need to be revisited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=4772)|
| 1:19:37| And as part of that, we did a comparison.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=4777)|
| 1:19:40| A lot of cities use minimums and maximums.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=4780)|
| 1:19:44| And Knoxville's standards are stated as minimums.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=4784)|
| 1:19:48| In certain cases, people exceed the minimum, which is really getting over-parked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=4788)|
| 1:19:53| But you can see from Asheville and Greenville that our minimums are their maximums generally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=4793)|
| 1:20:04| And this is across the board in any area, not only urban, but in suburban in those two communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=4804)|
| 1:20:11| And there's dozens of other examples out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=4811)|
| 1:20:15| I thought it was interesting in the Greenville maximum office space that it was so high,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=4815)|
| 1:20:20| but the one use that I can think of where it really does demand a lot of parking are call centers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=4820)|
| 1:20:27| where you've seen an old grocery store converted into a call center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=4827)|
| 1:20:34| It's the most cars that have parked in those places in 30 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=4834)|
| 1:20:41| Then the middle illustration is an example of redevelopment in Edgewood Park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=4841)|
| 1:20:48| which is about a mile from downtown Atlanta, taking an old gray field site, if you will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=4848)|
| 1:20:57| And they came back in with a new urban approach and put in a target.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=4857)|
| 1:21:01| And you can see the list of the uses on the thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=4861)|
| 1:21:07| They also had a main street entrance into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=4867)|
| 1:21:10| And the parking is much less there and just a lot more urban development in the core of the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=4870)|
| 1:21:19| And then the question is, why do this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=4879)|
| 1:21:23| It's an anti-sprawl device.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=4883)|
| 1:21:25| It's doing what Bill had talked about before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=4885)|
| 1:21:28| It's redevelopment of obsolete areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=4888)|
| 1:21:31| It's putting more square footage in places where there wasn't,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=4891)|
| 1:21:37| and a mix of uses where people can walk and don't necessarily have to drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=4897)|
| 1:21:43| And then finally, the implications for increasing a tax base, both through sales taxes and property tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=4903)|
| 1:21:52| So I think a lot of these kinds of tools are win-wins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=4912)|
| 1:21:56| And then the final one is when we were doing Magnolia and the recent Vestal Plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=4916)|
| 1:22:02| we recognized that certain districts, and this came up in a Burlington case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=4922)|
| 1:22:10| Burlington was a little trolley stop back in the 19-teens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=4930)|
| 1:22:16| And it was the first place you came to when you came in on Rutledge Pike| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=4936)|
| 1:22:20| or across the ferry on Holston River Road, and the trolley ended there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=4940)|
| 1:22:25| And so it was a natural place for those little slot commercial buildings to evolve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=4945)|
| 1:22:32| way before Asheville Highway was created.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=4952)|
| 1:22:35| Well, they never had any parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=4955)|
| 1:22:37| And the place went out of business for a better part of a year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=4957)|
| 1:22:41| and go back to get an occupancy permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=4961)|
| 1:22:44| And CODES is interested in, well, how are you going to handle the parking?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=4964)|
| 1:22:48| We need to have off-street parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=4968)|
| 1:22:49| And there's just no way in that kind of district to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=4969)|
| 1:22:53| So we're saying let's look at on-street parking as a substitute for off-street parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=4973)|
| 1:23:01| Not everything has to be off the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=4981)|
| 1:23:04| And shared parking arrangements for an overall district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=4984)|
| 1:23:08| Another example is, and we worked on this with policy development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=4988)|
| 1:23:13| and also in the Magnolia Plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=4993)|
| 1:23:17| But when we knew that James White Parkway and I-40 were going to be completed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=4997)|
| 1:23:21| that there would be acres of land under those viaducts for hundreds and hundreds of cars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=5001)|
| 1:23:27| And the kind of redevelopment that can continue to happen in the old city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=5007)|
| 1:23:32| and out through the warehouse district and out through downtown north,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=5012)|
| 1:23:36| whether it be residential or businesses, can share a common parking area under a viaduct like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=5016)|
| 1:23:43| And I think the city is heading in that direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=5023)|
| 1:23:47| Turning to conservation tools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=5027)|
| 1:23:50| Probably the most important thing that's out there right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=5030)|
| 1:23:54| and would continue to be the most important thing is the growth policy plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=5034)|
| 1:24:00| That was mandated by state law back in the late 90s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=5040)|
| 1:24:06| It was to avoid the cherry-picking kind of annexations that happened for years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=5046)|
| 1:24:13| and to have decisions made between cities and counties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=5053)|
| 1:24:18| as to where their growth boundaries were going to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=5058)|
| 1:24:21| Cities were required to put in an urban growth boundary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=5061)|
| 1:24:25| The county had to subdivide the remaining portions of its jurisdiction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=5065)|
| 1:24:30| into a planned growth area and a rural area if they chose to do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=5070)|
| 1:24:35| In Knoxville and Knox County, an agreement was struck between Farragut, the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=5075)|
| 1:24:41| and the city of Knoxville to recognize all three types of areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=5081)|
| 1:24:47| The map that you see is for east county sector.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=5087)|
| 1:24:51| And what we have found in looking at residential building permits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=5091)|
| 1:24:57| over the life of that plan, at least to 2009,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=5097)|
| 1:25:02| is that only 13% of the building permits have occurred in the rural area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=5102)|
| 1:25:12| And that area comprises over 40% of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=5112)|
| 1:25:17| So, you know, we feel that that is really working.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=5117)|
| 1:25:23| We also looked at the existing land use in the east county sector,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=5123)|
| 1:25:28| and only 2% of the agricultural forest and vacant land was lost from 2000 to 2006.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=5128)|
| 1:25:36| And we didn't go into where that was, whether it be the planned growth area or the rural area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=5136)|
| 1:25:41| but I know that anecdotally that the major portion of that was in the planned growth area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=5141)|
| 1:25:47| and that the rural area stayed the same,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=5147)|
| 1:25:50| given where the subdivisions are that I can recognize out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=5150)|
| 1:25:55| Final couple of tools, the scenic road overlays.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=5155)|
| 1:26:00| Some of you have seen this recently in the east county plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=5160)|
| 1:26:05| but it's not only the Thorn Grove Pikes and Kodak Roads,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=5165)|
| 1:26:09| but there could be other scenic corridors in Knoxville or Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=5169)|
| 1:26:14| And the idea there is to, you have a situation where the development is going to be lighter to begin with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=5174)|
| 1:26:22| but you want to conserve the scenic qualities as far as the landscape, the historic buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=5182)|
| 1:26:29| So the approach is, if people wanted to do it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=5189)|
| 1:26:34| what kind of signage, lighting, use of materials would be a complement to the traditional forms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=5194)|
| 1:26:44| and materials that were used along those corridors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=5204)|
| 1:26:51| This is one of the Georgia communities which has such a standard with the pumpkin there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=5211)|
| 1:26:58| and you can see more rural signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=5218)|
| 1:27:01| If you ever go off places along the Natchez Trace like Leepers Fork,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=5221)|
| 1:27:06| you can clearly see that they're using those kind of rural standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=5226)|
| 1:27:11| Then we have also begun to look at a proposed conservation corridor along the French Broad| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=5231)|
| 1:27:19| on both the south and north sides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=5239)|
| 1:27:23| And not only is the setting of the historic resources important,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=5243)|
| 1:27:29| there's well over 40 of them out there, but it's that rural landscape around them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=5249)|
| 1:27:36| And there's means to do that as far as cluster housing, if housing is going to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=5256)|
| 1:27:41| We'll be talking about a conservation subdivision ordinance in a second,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=5261)|
| 1:27:45| but to protect the setting of the resources is the major goal there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=5265)|
| 1:27:51| I'm going to give you a real quick overview of the hillside and ridgetop protection plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=5271)|
| 1:27:59| and where that stands right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=5279)|
| 1:28:01| There's a draft online if you'd like to look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=5281)|
| 1:28:04| It's going to the task force that was created through council and the county commission a couple years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=5284)|
| 1:28:13| later in or mid-June.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=5293)|
| 1:28:16| And this is so digested, it doesn't do justice to the draft plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=5296)|
| 1:28:24| but I just wanted to touch upon some highlights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=5304)|
| 1:28:28| Lack of clearing standards is one of the major problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=5308)|
| 1:28:33| If it's not a use on review case, in other words, a plan zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=5313)|
| 1:28:38| we'll oftentimes see things completely clear cut on the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=5318)|
| 1:28:42| In Knox County, unlike Knoxville, which does have some clearing standards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=5322)|
| 1:28:48| there's no clearing standards, so oftentimes we see complete clearing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=5328)|
| 1:28:52| and grading before a development even is contemplated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=5332)|
| 1:28:57| Lack of reforestation on slopes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=5337)|
| 1:29:01| I think if we look around town and Callahan Road is sort of the poster child on that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=5341)|
| 1:29:08| We're not doing anything to reclaim the natural setting of those slopes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=5348)|
| 1:29:13| and there are some standards which of all places have come from the Office of Surface Mining| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=5353)|
| 1:29:18| on strip mine reclamation that could really be promising for urban areas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=5358)|
| 1:29:23| and those are incorporated as a recommendation in the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=5363)|
| 1:29:28| And then this goes back to age-old codes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=5368)|
| 1:29:35| Subdivision regulations require 26-foot-wide minimum roads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=5375)|
| 1:29:39| So if you look at Lindbergh Forest or Lake Forest or Sequoia Hills,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=5379)|
| 1:29:44| those weren't 26-foot-wide roads, but they function rather nicely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=5384)|
| 1:29:48| And when you get into a hillside situation and you have to put in a 26-foot-wide road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=5388)|
| 1:29:54| it's going to be more expensive to begin with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=5394)|
| 1:29:57| but it's also going to require greater side cut slopes and that kind of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=5397)|
| 1:30:03| City engineering and county engineering have said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=5403)|
| 1:30:05| yeah, let's cut it back to where it could be 20 feet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=5405)|
| 1:30:08| so I think you're going to see some subdivision changes on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=5408)|
| 1:30:11| And then we've seen some ridiculous driveway grades, like 30 percent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=5411)|
| 1:30:17| and if somebody had a fire or a heart attack or something like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=5417)|
| 1:30:22| that vehicle's not getting up there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=5422)|
| 1:30:25| And so both the city and the county are looking to more stringent standards in that regard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=5425)|
| 1:30:31| This next table, you probably go, oh, my God, and it's a lot of numbers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=5431)|
| 1:30:36| and I'm going to cut to an example of how it might work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=5436)|
| 1:30:43| Right now, when you get one of the recommendations for a planned residential zone approval for MPC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=5443)|
| 1:30:54| if somebody had come in and said they wanted to do R1| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=5454)|
| 1:30:59| or something like that on a really steep area, we would say, wait a second,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=5459)|
| 1:31:03| we need to have site plan review on that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=5463)|
| 1:31:05| and see how you're dealing with the terrain and where the roads are going to be located| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=5465)|
| 1:31:10| and that kind of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=5470)|
| 1:31:12| So whether it's the city or the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=5472)|
| 1:31:14| most of the rezonings as far as residential are planned residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=5474)|
| 1:31:20| And what you see in this first or the middle column are the means that we use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=5480)|
| 1:31:27| to assign the density when it's coming to the planning commission and to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=5487)|
| 1:31:32| And it's been a formula that's basically been in use for 15 years now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=5492)|
| 1:31:38| and it's worked pretty well as far as, you know, we used to get requests,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=5498)|
| 1:31:42| well, I want to do PR at eight units an acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=5502)|
| 1:31:45| and we would say, well, it can be up to eight units per acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=5505)|
| 1:31:49| but the resource wasn't studied to say is it eight units even conceivable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=5509)|
| 1:31:55| given the lay of this terrain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=5515)|
| 1:31:58| And then with the advent of GIS systems, we said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=5518)|
| 1:32:01| well, we can actually calculate slope groups within any development site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=5521)|
| 1:32:08| So I'm going to quickly flip to the very last page to show you how this sort of basically works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=5528)|
| 1:32:15| And concurrently I'll just talk about conservation subdivisions too in doing so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=5535)|
| 1:32:21| Here's a site that is within the hillside and ridgetop protection area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=5541)|
| 1:32:27| because most of it's over 15 percent slopes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=5547)|
| 1:32:30| The green areas are fairly level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=5550)|
| 1:32:33| The yellow areas are at least 15 to 25 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=5553)|
| 1:32:38| And then the reddish and orange are over 25 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=5558)|
| 1:32:43| So we can, our GIS staff can look at those patterns and say you have so many acres in the zero to 15,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=5563)|
| 1:32:54| so many, you know, in the 15 to 25, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=5574)|
| 1:32:58| And then it just becomes a numeric formula where you go back to say, okay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=5578)|
| 1:33:02| you got two acres in 15 to 25 percent and two dwelling units per acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=5582)|
| 1:33:10| where you're allotting four dwelling units for that area, that would be the way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=5590)|
| 1:33:14| And then it just ratchets towards less density higher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=5594)|
| 1:33:19| And we began to put in two other categories.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=5599)|
| 1:33:24| It used to be just 25 and above, but in the course of the work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=5604)|
| 1:33:28| we began to look at the really steep stuff like Sevier County has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=5608)|
| 1:33:34| where you see a lot of the hillside houses there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=5614)|
| 1:33:37| And we felt if anybody wants to get into those areas, it's probably not a good idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=5617)|
| 1:33:42| And most developers don't anyway here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=5622)|
| 1:33:45| And so it was very low density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=5625)|
| 1:33:47| And then the 50 percent or more, there's only one parcel in all of Knox County that's,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=5627)|
| 1:33:54| I won't say all of Knox County that's on a 50 percent slope, but that is out in the rural area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=5634)|
| 1:34:00| But then you have some anomalies like above Lonsdale,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=5640)|
| 1:34:04| all those little lots that are mostly tax delinquent anyway, and they're undeveloped.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=5644)|
| 1:34:11| And those were platted probably from the plains of the Midwest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=5651)|
| 1:34:15| and never knew what the real terrain was and haven't been developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=5655)|
| 1:34:22| And then we're exploring a percentage of clearing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=5662)|
| 1:34:26| and we've tested this with several subdivisions, and we think that that works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=5666)|
| 1:34:32| Then flipping it over, it will have height limitations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=5672)|
| 1:34:38| Okay, 35 feet high, clearing limitations in relation to the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=5678)|
| 1:34:44| We've already talked about the road widths.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=5684)|
| 1:34:46| And then finally, partnering with Legacy Parks and other organizations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=5686)|
| 1:34:52| to actually set aside open space corridors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=5692)|
| 1:34:55| You saw those in the park plan as well already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=5695)|
| 1:35:01| Conservation subdivisions is very quickly, it's a means of smaller lot sizes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=5701)|
| 1:35:06| smaller road widths, putting the development in a more compact area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=5706)|
| 1:35:12| so you can conserve the resource like the hillsides or park lands elsewhere on the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=5712)|
| 1:35:20| And we're throwing in a bonus density on that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=5720)|
| 1:35:24| if one provides public access to those kinds of open spaces is the proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=5724)|
| 1:35:30| That's what we've been kind of working on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=5730)|
| 1:35:32| and I think as we go through a review process on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=5732)|
| 1:35:37| you'll be seeing these tools before you for your consideration as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=5737)|
| 1:35:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=5743)|
| 1:35:44| Any questions people have?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=5744)|
| 1:35:48| That was a very thorough discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=5748)|
| 1:35:50| I've never seen this council this quiet, and I'm happy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=5750)|
| 1:35:53| Please, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=5753)|
| 1:35:55| If there is no questions from council, we'll move into public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=5755)|
| 1:35:59| And I will just say if anybody would like to address city council, come on down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=5759)|
| 1:36:08| No one's coming down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=5768)|
| 1:36:09| I guess we're good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=5769)|
| 1:36:11| I think then we're going to stand adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=5771)|
| 1:36:13| Thank you, everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=5773)|
| 1:36:14| Appreciate the information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=5774)|
| 1:36:19| I don't see his light.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=5779)|
| 1:36:22| Mr. DellaVoppe?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=5782)|
| 1:36:25| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=5785)|
| 1:36:26| You can leave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=5786)|
| 1:36:27| Mr. DellaVoppe is going to ask a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=5787)|
| 1:36:29| Yeah, I think this one's for MPC, and that is if we are trying to foster development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=5789)|
| 1:36:35| and growth and jobs and those kinds of things in one area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=5795)|
| 1:36:39| is there a tool to protect the surrounding area from having sort of spill-off development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=5799)|
| 1:36:46| if what we have is something that we want to keep the nature of the site?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=5806)|
| 1:36:51| In other words, is there a tool that you have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=5811)|
| 1:36:54| and maybe it's an overlay tool based on your descriptions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=5814)|
| 1:36:57| what tool do you have to protect surrounding areas?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=5817)|
| 1:37:02| Well, first of all, if it's a very intense development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=5822)|
| 1:37:06| like a commercial development or industrial development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=5826)|
| 1:37:10| we feel that such a tool as the new employment center zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=5830)|
| 1:37:17| or planned commercial should be used, so there has to be a use on review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=5837)|
| 1:37:21| and you can look at the landscaping and the buffers to an immediate area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=5841)|
| 1:37:27| Then, you know, we usually don't try,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=5847)|
| 1:37:30| and that's what the basis of zoning was when it first started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=5850)|
| 1:37:32| You don't try to put industrial in the middle of a neighborhood to begin with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=5852)|
| 1:37:39| We also have the growth policy plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=5859)|
| 1:37:43| which is pointing to areas where certain kinds of development are appropriate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=5863)|
| 1:37:49| such as in the urban growth area and the planned growth area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=5869)|
| 1:37:52| and where higher forms of development are not appropriate, such as the rural area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=5872)|
| 1:37:58| So those are the basic tools that you use in terms of zoning?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=5878)|
| 1:38:01| They come to the top of my head, yeah, as far as that kind of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=5881)|
| 1:38:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=5884)|
| 1:38:06| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=5886)|
| 1:38:07| Since we've already stood adjourned, I will just say good night to everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=5887)|
| 1:38:10| Thank you, everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877100527?start=5890)|
