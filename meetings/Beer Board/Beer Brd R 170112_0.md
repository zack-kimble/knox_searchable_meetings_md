| 0:00:00| Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=0)|
| 0:00:01| It's 5.30, so let's call this beer board workshop to order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=1)|
| 0:00:11| Basically, we have several people here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=11)|
| 0:00:15| Let's get the meeting started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=15)|
| 0:00:17| And after the roll call, I'll introduce some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=17)|
| 0:00:19| of the people who are here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=19)|
| 0:00:23| Let's start with a moment of silence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=23)|
| 0:00:26| Instead of a prayer today, we can just all do what we want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=26)|
| 0:00:29| So a moment of silence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=29)|
| 0:00:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=44)|
| 0:00:46| Councilman De La Verpa, will you lead us in the pledge?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=46)|
| 0:00:49| Please address the flag.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=49)|
| 0:00:51| I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=51)|
| 0:00:56| and to the republic for which it stands,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=56)|
| 0:00:58| one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=58)|
| 0:01:02| and justice for all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=62)|
| 0:01:08| Would you call the roll, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=68)|
| 0:01:10| Councilman Brown, Councilman Campin, Councilman De La Verpa.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=70)|
| 0:01:15| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=75)|
| 0:01:16| Vice Mayor Grieve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=76)|
| 0:01:17| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=77)|
| 0:01:18| Councilman Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=78)|
| 0:01:19| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=79)|
| 0:01:20| Councilman Pavlis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=80)|
| 0:01:21| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=81)|
| 0:01:21| Councilman Saunders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=81)|
| 0:01:23| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=83)|
| 0:01:23| Councilman Stair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=83)|
| 0:01:24| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=84)|
| 0:01:25| Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=85)|
| 0:01:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=86)|
| 0:01:27| Just a word of caution, these mics are hot all the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=87)|
| 0:01:32| And so when you have a conversation or say something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=92)|
| 0:01:36| we will all be able to hear it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=96)|
| 0:01:40| Some people learn that the hard way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=100)|
| 0:01:43| Thank you, Councilman Stair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=103)|
| 0:01:46| This workshop has been called, we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=106)|
| 0:01:50| talked about it back in September and October,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=110)|
| 0:01:53| when we were having a number of compliance checks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=113)|
| 0:01:55| And it seemed like there were a lot of people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=115)|
| 0:01:58| willing to sell to minors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=118)|
| 0:02:00| And this became a concern of this beer board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=120)|
| 0:02:03| And then we got into the holidays,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=123)|
| 0:02:04| and it wasn't a good time to have a workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=124)|
| 0:02:07| And so this was the soonest that we could have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=127)|
| 0:02:09| So basically, our goals today are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=129)|
| 0:02:11| to see if we can come up with some strategies or things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=131)|
| 0:02:15| to reduce beer sales to underage customers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=135)|
| 0:02:18| And we will also learn about the application| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=138)|
| 0:02:21| of scanners in beer sales, because that has been something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=141)|
| 0:02:24| that we've talked about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=144)|
| 0:02:26| We have with us today Charlie Jordan from Safe Serve,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=146)|
| 0:02:32| who has worked with the scanner business for a while,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=152)|
| 0:02:35| developed a scanner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=155)|
| 0:02:36| And he's going to give us the ins and outs and the ups| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=156)|
| 0:02:38| and downs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=158)|
| 0:02:40| We have Kim Pouncey from Top Shelf,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=160)|
| 0:02:42| and she does a lot of training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=162)|
| 0:02:44| And Kim has been on the road when the wine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=164)|
| 0:02:46| sales started for months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=166)|
| 0:02:48| And she's now finally back in town,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=168)|
| 0:02:50| getting all the grocery stores trained| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=170)|
| 0:02:52| to be able to sell wine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=172)|
| 0:02:55| Someone mentioned that she was buying red wine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=175)|
| 0:02:58| vinegar in the grocery store at Kroger,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=178)|
| 0:03:01| and they asked to see her ID, because the sale in the car| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=181)|
| 0:03:04| saw red wine on the vinegar thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=184)|
| 0:03:07| So I'm glad that people are on top of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=187)|
| 0:03:09| It's a tough drink, I'll tell you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=189)|
| 0:03:10| It is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=190)|
| 0:03:11| It is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=191)|
| 0:03:11| It is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=191)|
| 0:03:12| And of course, I think we all know Karen Pershing, who| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=192)|
| 0:03:15| is the executive director of the Metropolitan Drug Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=195)|
| 0:03:19| And she is going to start us off| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=199)|
| 0:03:21| with telling us a few things that we might need to know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=201)|
| 0:03:28| Thank you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=208)|
| 0:03:29| It's great to be with you this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=209)|
| 0:03:32| I'm going to go rather quickly through this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=212)|
| 0:03:36| But as you all, can you hear me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=216)|
| 0:03:38| Pull the microphone up a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=218)|
| 0:03:40| There.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=220)|
| 0:03:41| Is that better?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=221)|
| 0:03:42| That's better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=222)|
| 0:03:42| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=222)|
| 0:03:44| I think you all know pretty much who we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=224)|
| 0:03:50| But we've been in this community now for 30 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=230)|
| 0:03:53| And of course, we were formed and chartered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=233)|
| 0:03:56| by city and county government officials| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=236)|
| 0:03:58| to really be the primary prevention hub around substance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=238)|
| 0:04:03| abuse issues in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=243)|
| 0:04:05| So of course, a lot of our focus is on young people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=245)|
| 0:04:08| and making sure they get started| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=248)|
| 0:04:11| on a good productive future and not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=251)|
| 0:04:13| get caught up in the cycle of addiction at an early age.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=253)|
| 0:04:21| Our mission and vision is really to improve health| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=261)|
| 0:04:24| in our community by reducing the likelihood of substance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=264)|
| 0:04:28| use and abuse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=268)|
| 0:04:30| And of course, our vision is to create| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=270)|
| 0:04:32| a healthy and safe community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=272)|
| 0:04:34| Because there are safety issues involved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=274)|
| 0:04:36| when you talk about substance abuse related issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=276)|
| 0:04:42| This just shows you, and I apologize| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=282)|
| 0:04:44| for the data being so behind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=284)|
| 0:04:49| But we don't anticipate, as you can see, the trends.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=289)|
| 0:04:53| We are doing this survey again in 2017,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=293)|
| 0:04:57| probably within the next month or two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=297)|
| 0:04:59| We had some legislative issues that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=299)|
| 0:05:02| happened at the state level that prohibited us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=302)|
| 0:05:06| from doing this appropriately in 2015.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=306)|
| 0:05:10| So we've got a little gap there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=310)|
| 0:05:11| But you can see, just by looking at this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=311)|
| 0:05:14| that alcohol is definitely the drug of choice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=314)|
| 0:05:16| among our high school students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=316)|
| 0:05:19| And that was lifetime use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=319)|
| 0:05:21| This is the last 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=321)|
| 0:05:22| So this is current use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=322)|
| 0:05:24| So you can see, we've made some progress.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=324)|
| 0:05:28| We're seeing that rate go down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=328)|
| 0:05:31| But there's still roughly a third| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=331)|
| 0:05:34| of high school students that are surveyed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=334)|
| 0:05:37| say that they're abusing alcohol or using alcohol.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=337)|
| 0:05:41| This is 9th through 12th graders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=341)|
| 0:05:44| But here's another thing that I want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=344)|
| 0:05:46| to show your attention to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=346)|
| 0:05:48| We also do a middle school survey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=348)|
| 0:05:50| So you can see that this behavior is starting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=350)|
| 0:05:53| at younger and younger ages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=353)|
| 0:05:55| So this is 6th, 7th, and 8th graders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=355)|
| 0:05:58| So you can see, again, why we focus a lot of our education| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=358)|
| 0:06:03| at the middle school age.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=363)|
| 0:06:04| Because if you wait till high school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=364)|
| 0:06:06| some of these behaviors are already starting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=366)|
| 0:06:08| Let me ask you a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=368)|
| 0:06:10| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=370)|
| 0:06:10| Do you actually interview these elementary kids?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=370)|
| 0:06:14| How do you come up with that data?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=374)|
| 0:06:16| Well, the surveys are actually done anonymously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=376)|
| 0:06:19| And they're randomly selected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=379)|
| 0:06:20| We don't survey every student in every school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=380)|
| 0:06:25| But the survey, it's a Scantron form.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=385)|
| 0:06:28| There's no way you can identify the responses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=388)|
| 0:06:34| and tie it back to a particular student.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=394)|
| 0:06:37| It is self-reported data.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=397)|
| 0:06:38| So as if with any self-reported data,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=398)|
| 0:06:43| there's going to be a possibility that somebody may| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=403)|
| 0:06:46| not be truthful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=406)|
| 0:06:49| But there's a little speech or whatever| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=409)|
| 0:06:52| we say that the teacher, actually, who's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=412)|
| 0:06:55| administering it, goes over how important it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=415)|
| 0:06:58| is for them to answer truthfully to each question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=418)|
| 0:07:04| So it goes down as young as 6th grade?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=424)|
| 0:07:06| 6th grade, which is middle school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=426)|
| 0:07:10| You're welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=430)|
| 0:07:12| So we have been partnering with the city and county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=432)|
| 0:07:16| beer boards for quite a number of years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=436)|
| 0:07:19| And what we do through the Metro Drug Coalition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=439)|
| 0:07:23| is we offer packets to each new beer permit holder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=443)|
| 0:07:27| And in those packets is a lot of information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=447)|
| 0:07:30| on what they can do to prevent underage sales| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=450)|
| 0:07:34| in their business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=454)|
| 0:07:35| There's some stickers that they can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=455)|
| 0:07:38| put that they're going to be checking ID on the business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=458)|
| 0:07:41| premises.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=461)|
| 0:07:42| There's buttons the employees can wear that say no sale,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=462)|
| 0:07:46| no ID, no sale, no way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=466)|
| 0:07:49| Just reminders for them to use in their business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=469)|
| 0:07:54| But it also has a letter from us saying, if you need any help,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=474)|
| 0:07:59| that we're happy to provide any additional information,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=479)|
| 0:08:02| materials, or help, including consultation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=482)|
| 0:08:06| So consultation, we primarily worked with you guys| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=486)|
| 0:08:09| on those who have failed compliance checks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=489)|
| 0:08:14| and they have to submit a remediation plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=494)|
| 0:08:17| We send a letter to all of the businesses that failed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=497)|
| 0:08:22| and offer our services to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=502)|
| 0:08:25| But sometimes you all direct them to us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=505)|
| 0:08:29| when they come before you, especially if their plans are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=509)|
| 0:08:32| very weak, which we do see that sometimes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=512)|
| 0:08:36| They bring them to us and we're like, oh, you put a lot of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=516)|
| 0:08:38| thought into this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=518)|
| 0:08:40| So we're available to help them with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=520)|
| 0:08:43| And then, again, I mentioned the compliance check follow up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=523)|
| 0:08:47| We do follow up with them and offer any kind of consultation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=527)|
| 0:08:51| services they may need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=531)|
| 0:08:54| Suggestions to strengthen compliance rates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=534)|
| 0:08:57| through policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=537)|
| 0:08:58| We've worked with you all in the past| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=538)|
| 0:09:00| on tweaking your billboard policies and procedures| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=540)|
| 0:09:04| to try to send stronger messages to businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=544)|
| 0:09:08| So we'll continue to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=548)|
| 0:09:11| I fear that the people that are watching on TV,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=551)|
| 0:09:14| assuming this is on community TV, cannot hear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=554)|
| 0:09:17| No?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=557)|
| 0:09:18| I don't know that it's on community TV right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=558)|
| 0:09:20| Never mind, we can hear you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=560)|
| 0:09:21| Because the NPC was meeting and I'm not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=561)|
| 0:09:25| sure they've switched it over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=565)|
| 0:09:26| The light back there is not blinking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=566)|
| 0:09:28| The mic was not picking her up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=568)|
| 0:09:30| It's not picking me up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=570)|
| 0:09:32| Maybe it's being into it, I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=572)|
| 0:09:35| Yeah, I don't have the most booming voice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=575)|
| 0:09:37| I apologize for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=577)|
| 0:09:38| We can hear you, but I'm not sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=578)|
| 0:09:40| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=580)|
| 0:09:41| Behind you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=581)|
| 0:09:42| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=582)|
| 0:09:44| We look at this issue, again, it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=584)|
| 0:09:47| an issue of community safety, underage sales.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=587)|
| 0:09:51| Because what we know about the adolescent brain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=591)|
| 0:09:54| is it's not fully developed in some folks until around age 25.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=594)|
| 0:10:01| So until that time, their prefrontal cortex| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=601)|
| 0:10:03| is still, which is your executive functioning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=603)|
| 0:10:07| judgment center of your brain, which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=607)|
| 0:10:10| tells you, can sort out consequences| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=610)|
| 0:10:13| and think through things before you make decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=613)|
| 0:10:17| And adolescents just don't have that capacity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=617)|
| 0:10:20| I don't care if they're straight A students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=620)|
| 0:10:23| They're still dumb.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=623)|
| 0:10:26| And so it's important for us as adults| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=626)|
| 0:10:29| to help them make those decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=629)|
| 0:10:33| And so sometimes that means putting barriers in the way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=633)|
| 0:10:37| so that they don't have access and don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=637)|
| 0:10:39| have the opportunity to make wrong decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=639)|
| 0:10:44| So that's the reason we're really concerned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=644)|
| 0:10:47| We've lost kids to drunk driving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=647)|
| 0:10:50| When you've got an adolescent drunk driver on the road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=650)|
| 0:10:52| they're more likely to put us in jeopardy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=652)|
| 0:10:56| So again, this is a community safety issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=656)|
| 0:11:02| Alcohol and alcohol sales, especially with young people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=662)|
| 0:11:07| So compliance checks are extremely important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=667)|
| 0:11:11| And we appreciate what a great job KPD| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=671)|
| 0:11:14| does in conducting those, especially on a regular basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=674)|
| 0:11:19| I can stand here and say, unfortunately, we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=679)|
| 0:11:21| don't have that same regularity in the county yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=681)|
| 0:11:25| But we hope to get there in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=685)|
| 0:11:28| But KPD, I know, has done at least monthly compliance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=688)|
| 0:11:33| checks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=693)|
| 0:11:33| There's been some months where they've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=693)|
| 0:11:35| been able to do two a month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=695)|
| 0:11:37| But the compliance checks are really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=697)|
| 0:11:41| a part of an environmental prevention| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=701)|
| 0:11:43| strategy around reducing the likelihood that kids are going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=703)|
| 0:11:47| to have access to alcohol.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=707)|
| 0:11:50| They're thought to be the most effective when they're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=710)|
| 0:11:53| frequent, well-publicized, and well-designed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=713)|
| 0:11:58| In fact, there's a study in your packet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=718)|
| 0:11:59| I put in there, a research study showing that retailers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=719)|
| 0:12:04| will call each other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=724)|
| 0:12:07| KPD shows up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=727)|
| 0:12:09| They do a compliance check.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=729)|
| 0:12:10| They're going to call their neighbor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=730)|
| 0:12:12| Even if KPD doesn't go to their neighbor, for a while| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=732)|
| 0:12:15| that neighbor is going to be extremely careful| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=735)|
| 0:12:18| because KPD is out there and they're in their area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=738)|
| 0:12:21| So again, it shows that there is heightened awareness| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=741)|
| 0:12:26| among businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=746)|
| 0:12:27| If they know that people are out there checking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=747)|
| 0:12:32| Do you have any statistics on how many citations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=752)|
| 0:12:35| in a year or something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=755)|
| 0:12:36| Well, this is what I was going to show you here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=756)|
| 0:12:39| We keep track of the compliance rates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=759)|
| 0:12:42| for the city and the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=762)|
| 0:12:44| And so you can see here, there's a lot of ups and downs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=764)|
| 0:12:48| there with the compliance rates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=768)|
| 0:12:51| And again, 2016 doesn't look terrible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=771)|
| 0:12:55| But we had a couple of months there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=775)|
| 0:12:57| towards the end of the year where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=777)|
| 0:13:00| we had many more businesses that were failing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=780)|
| 0:13:04| So our rate would have been much higher in 2016| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=784)|
| 0:13:07| had we not had that unusual kind of blip there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=787)|
| 0:13:11| But you can see, the higher we can keep them again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=791)|
| 0:13:16| the less likely our adolescents are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=796)|
| 0:13:19| going to get a hold of alcohol, at least| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=799)|
| 0:13:22| through retail outlets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=802)|
| 0:13:26| And then this just shows how many KPD is doing per year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=806)|
| 0:13:30| So you can see again, they're on the increase| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=810)|
| 0:13:34| to try to do more per year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=814)|
| 0:13:37| And again, so not all businesses are being checked every year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=817)|
| 0:13:45| So again, when they are being checked,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=825)|
| 0:13:49| you wonder if they fail when they're being checked,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=829)|
| 0:13:53| how often they're serving or providing alcohol| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=833)|
| 0:13:56| in between those checks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=836)|
| 0:13:58| So again, that's another reason why it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=838)|
| 0:14:03| important to do them frequently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=843)|
| 0:14:04| And it's important to send a very strong message| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=844)|
| 0:14:07| if they do fail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=847)|
| 0:14:09| Because the likelihood that they're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=849)|
| 0:14:11| selling at other times when you're not checking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=851)|
| 0:14:14| is going to be very high if they fail a compliance check.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=854)|
| 0:14:18| Those are actual business numbers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=858)|
| 0:14:20| we knocked on their door and had the cadet or someone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=860)|
| 0:14:24| pose as a purchaser?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=864)|
| 0:14:25| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=865)|
| 0:14:27| And let me reassure you, too, because I've actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=867)|
| 0:14:30| been out on some of these compliance checks personally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=870)|
| 0:14:33| And my daughter actually was one of the underage people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=873)|
| 0:14:36| for a while.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=876)|
| 0:14:37| They don't try to trick you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=877)|
| 0:14:40| There's no trickery involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=880)|
| 0:14:43| In fact, once she got within six months of turning 21,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=883)|
| 0:14:47| they wouldn't use her anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=887)|
| 0:14:49| So again, they don't even try to bump up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=889)|
| 0:14:51| to the birth date on the underage people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=891)|
| 0:14:55| that they're using.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=895)|
| 0:14:56| So it's done very professionally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=896)|
| 0:14:58| It's done very well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=898)|
| 0:15:01| And it's not designed to trick anyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=901)|
| 0:15:05| They're just very upfront about the whole process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=905)|
| 0:15:09| And you can probably say a little more about that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=909)|
| 0:15:12| than I can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=912)|
| 0:15:15| Oops, I'm going the wrong way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=915)|
| 0:15:17| You all have my contact information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=917)|
| 0:15:19| Anything that we can do at the Metro Drug Coalition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=919)|
| 0:15:24| to help you all, we are willing to do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=924)|
| 0:15:27| I have put a couple policies from some other areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=927)|
| 0:15:33| Metropolitan Davidson County's beer board rules and regs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=933)|
| 0:15:37| are in there, as well as the city of Alcoa.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=937)|
| 0:15:40| I live close to the Knox Blount County line| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=940)|
| 0:15:43| and go to Blount County quite a bit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=943)|
| 0:15:46| to eat groceries and things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=946)|
| 0:15:49| And in their beer board requirements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=949)|
| 0:15:54| they card everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=954)|
| 0:15:56| And I just think it's a good practice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=956)|
| 0:15:58| My husband and I, we don't care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=958)|
| 0:16:01| In fact, I find it flattering at my age| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=961)|
| 0:16:03| when they ask for my ID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=963)|
| 0:16:05| So it's just something to think about, increasing fines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=965)|
| 0:16:11| Davidson County, if you look at their beer board fines,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=971)|
| 0:16:14| first offense is $1,500.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=974)|
| 0:16:17| It gets your attention by increasing the fines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=977)|
| 0:16:21| So again, we don't want to penalize people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=981)|
| 0:16:25| but we do want to send a very strong message| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=985)|
| 0:16:28| from the beginning that we take this seriously, especially| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=988)|
| 0:16:32| selling to underage folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=992)|
| 0:16:34| And we expect you all to be responsible business owners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=994)|
| 0:16:38| And that's all we're asking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=998)|
| 0:16:39| We want them to be successful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=999)|
| 0:16:41| It helps all of us if we have a thriving business community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=1001)|
| 0:16:45| So we're all about that, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=1005)|
| 0:16:47| We just want to make sure that they're doing it the right way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=1007)|
| 0:16:51| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=1011)|
| 0:16:51| Thank you, Karen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=1011)|
| 0:16:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=1012)|
| 0:16:53| I guess a year ago, I went through the compliance checks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=1013)|
| 0:16:58| because I thought that it was probably convenience stores that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=1018)|
| 0:17:00| were more likely to sell to underage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=1020)|
| 0:17:03| And the data showed that, in fact, it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=1023)|
| 0:17:05| was people with the on-off premise restaurants and bars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=1025)|
| 0:17:08| with better trained personnel than a convenience store,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=1028)|
| 0:17:12| usually, that were more likely to sell to underage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=1032)|
| 0:17:15| And it was one of those things where your mind is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=1035)|
| 0:17:18| set to think one thing, but the data showed something different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=1038)|
| 0:17:22| And it was a 20% difference in them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=1042)|
| 0:17:26| So that was a big change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=1046)|
| 0:17:29| Well, we've talked about training| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=1049)|
| 0:17:30| and how important it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=1050)|
| 0:17:33| And sometimes it takes, and sometimes it doesn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=1053)|
| 0:17:37| Kim Pouncy is with Top Shelf, and she's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=1057)|
| 0:17:39| been training for a year or several.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=1059)|
| 0:17:42| And so she's going to talk with us about that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=1062)|
| 0:17:44| for about 10 or 15 minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=1064)|
| 0:17:46| This is training inside the company or task force training?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=1066)|
| 0:17:52| It can be, what I'm going to talk about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=1072)|
| 0:17:54| is a number of ways to do the training| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=1074)|
| 0:17:57| and distribute and facilitate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=1077)|
| 0:18:00| The process, once you do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=1080)|
| 0:18:01| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=1081)|
| 0:18:01| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=1081)|
| 0:18:03| So training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=1083)|
| 0:18:06| A lot of you know me, and some of you don't know me at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=1086)|
| 0:18:09| For those that have known me, I've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=1089)|
| 0:18:11| been doing this for 20 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=1091)|
| 0:18:12| And I'm really passionate about training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=1092)|
| 0:18:17| My feeling about people that fail compliance checks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=1097)|
| 0:18:22| with no training, that's kind of like shutting the barn door| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=1102)|
| 0:18:26| after the horse is out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=1106)|
| 0:18:27| It's like, OK, now you've been penalized for things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=1107)|
| 0:18:31| that you didn't know about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=1111)|
| 0:18:33| And now you must go to court, and now you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=1113)|
| 0:18:37| have to take a class and learn the stuff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=1117)|
| 0:18:39| that you should have known before we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=1119)|
| 0:18:41| did our compliance check.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=1121)|
| 0:18:43| So that's kind of where I am on that issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=1123)|
| 0:18:49| I try very hard to make sure that we do everything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=1129)|
| 0:18:52| we can to make it as easy for businesses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=1132)|
| 0:18:54| to get the information that they need between fear boards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=1134)|
| 0:18:58| and the TABC and those types of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=1138)|
| 0:19:03| A lot of times when I present like this, people look at me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=1143)|
| 0:19:06| and they're like, well, you own the company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=1146)|
| 0:19:08| You're just here to sell to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=1148)|
| 0:19:10| Well, I am and I'm not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=1150)|
| 0:19:13| I'm here to sell the concept of training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=1153)|
| 0:19:16| I don't really care where it comes from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=1156)|
| 0:19:18| Yes, I would prefer it to come from us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=1158)|
| 0:19:21| Of course I would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=1161)|
| 0:19:22| But training is what keeps our community safe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=1162)|
| 0:19:26| And it's what keeps our businesses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=1166)|
| 0:19:28| from being penalized from things that they really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=1168)|
| 0:19:30| don't know they need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=1170)|
| 0:19:36| So beer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=1176)|
| 0:19:37| Beer is the reason we're here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=1177)|
| 0:19:41| Beer seems to be innocuous, but it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=1181)|
| 0:19:44| is the most commonly used intoxicant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=1184)|
| 0:19:46| in underage drinking, DUI arrests, alcoholics,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=1186)|
| 0:19:49| heavy drinkers, DUI deaths, and injuries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=1189)|
| 0:19:53| It is the number one most abused alcoholic beverage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=1193)|
| 0:19:57| Compliance checks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=1197)|
| 0:20:01| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=1201)|
| 0:20:03| So what do they show us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=1203)|
| 0:20:04| We have higher failure rates that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=1204)|
| 0:20:06| could indicate a decreased concern by businesses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=1206)|
| 0:20:11| or their employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=1211)|
| 0:20:13| Employees may or may not be trained at all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=1213)|
| 0:20:15| on proper carting or not trained well on carting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=1215)|
| 0:20:19| And managers may not be taking these issues seriously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=1219)|
| 0:20:23| So like Karen said, if businesses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=1223)|
| 0:20:25| are failing random compliance checks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=1225)|
| 0:20:29| how many minors are actually showing their very real ID| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=1229)|
| 0:20:34| and still getting served alcohol?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=1234)|
| 0:20:37| Now, I will say that I have a step-grandson that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=1237)|
| 0:20:40| was buying beer when he was 19 years old.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=1240)|
| 0:20:43| All he had, he had a fake ID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=1243)|
| 0:20:45| I never got to see it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=1245)|
| 0:20:47| And all they asked him to do was repeat his date of birth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=1247)|
| 0:20:50| off of his ID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=1250)|
| 0:20:51| So he would hold it up, and he would tell them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=1251)|
| 0:20:53| when he was born.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=1253)|
| 0:20:55| And his friends gave him $20 each.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=1255)|
| 0:20:59| And he got to keep the change for every case of beer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=1259)|
| 0:21:01| that he bought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=1261)|
| 0:21:02| He'd walk out with five cases of beer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=1262)|
| 0:21:06| with an ID that didn't belong to him when he was 19.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=1266)|
| 0:21:09| Because they didn't look at it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=1269)|
| 0:21:11| They didn't look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=1271)|
| 0:21:12| All they had to do was put the date of birth in the register.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=1272)|
| 0:21:15| That's all they had to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=1275)|
| 0:21:16| So all he had to do was tell them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=1276)|
| 0:21:17| what his date of birth was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=1277)|
| 0:21:19| You know, in Brenda's point on the on and off premise thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=1279)|
| 0:21:24| so I have really had my eyes open now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=1284)|
| 0:21:27| that I'm doing the wine and grocery stores| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=1287)|
| 0:21:29| and dealing with liquor stores.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=1289)|
| 0:21:30| It's a different kind of person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=1290)|
| 0:21:34| Restaurant people tend to be, and I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=1294)|
| 0:21:36| was in the restaurant industry for 25 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=1296)|
| 0:21:38| so I can say this, they are so ADD.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=1298)|
| 0:21:43| They hate structure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=1303)|
| 0:21:46| Structure, they're just going from one moment to the next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=1306)|
| 0:21:53| You have most of these people are 18 to 23-ish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=1313)|
| 0:21:58| And again, their brain is not fully formed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=1318)|
| 0:22:00| They don't understand consequence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=1320)|
| 0:22:04| Whereas for food stores and liquor stores,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=1324)|
| 0:22:07| these people are so much more focused| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=1327)|
| 0:22:11| and they're so much more grown up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=1331)|
| 0:22:13| And most of your clerks have been working there for years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=1333)|
| 0:22:17| and they're older, and this is their job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=1337)|
| 0:22:20| It is their livelihood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=1340)|
| 0:22:21| Whereas when you talk to a server,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=1341)|
| 0:22:23| I'm just doing this till I get out of school and get a real job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=1343)|
| 0:22:27| So it's a completely different mindset.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=1347)|
| 0:22:30| The other thing about the training is the off premise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=1350)|
| 0:22:33| has a shorter training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=1353)|
| 0:22:36| And really, their main focus, don't sell to drunk people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=1356)|
| 0:22:40| and don't sell to underage people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=1360)|
| 0:22:43| So you can just focus on those two points mainly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=1363)|
| 0:22:46| For people that work in a restaurant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=1366)|
| 0:22:48| they have to know what a drink is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=1368)|
| 0:22:51| how many drinks make you drunk, how to calculate drinks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=1371)|
| 0:22:55| They have to know how alcohol gets in, how alcohol gets out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=1375)|
| 0:22:58| plus carding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=1378)|
| 0:22:59| They're there for five hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=1379)|
| 0:23:00| And by the time they leave, it's just all mush.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=1380)|
| 0:23:05| So that's kind of your difference there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=1385)|
| 0:23:08| between the two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=1388)|
| 0:23:11| So the enforcement issues that we face with compliance checks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=1391)|
| 0:23:14| is not all businesses fail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=1394)|
| 0:23:17| We have a lack of business-friendly options| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=1397)|
| 0:23:20| because the only thing you can do at a compliance check| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=1400)|
| 0:23:22| is either increase fines or enforce training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=1402)|
| 0:23:26| That's all you can do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=1406)|
| 0:23:27| It's going to cost them money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=1407)|
| 0:23:30| Businesses see compliance checks as gotcha.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=1410)|
| 0:23:33| Fines are seen as a revenue source for our government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=1413)|
| 0:23:36| And the businesses just flat out, first response| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=1416)|
| 0:23:39| is, it's my employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=1419)|
| 0:23:41| They aren't doing what they're supposed to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=1421)|
| 0:23:43| Boom, they're out of here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=1423)|
| 0:23:44| That's my policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=1424)|
| 0:23:45| As soon as an employee gets caught in a sting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=1425)|
| 0:23:47| they're out of here, which is another thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=1427)|
| 0:23:51| I would like to change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=1431)|
| 0:23:54| What they accomplish, though, compliance checks accomplish,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=1434)|
| 0:23:56| they reinforce the fact that we need training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=1436)|
| 0:24:00| They make businesses much more aware| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=1440)|
| 0:24:02| of how strong their company carding policies are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=1442)|
| 0:24:06| how well their employees are doing their jobs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=1446)|
| 0:24:10| improve community safety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=1450)|
| 0:24:12| And in larger businesses, they're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=1452)|
| 0:24:15| seeing what a store is doing, a particular area is doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=1455)|
| 0:24:19| So it could be that that cadet was a real minor that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=1459)|
| 0:24:25| purchased a case of beer and went out and killed somebody,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=1465)|
| 0:24:28| and there's a huge lawsuit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=1468)|
| 0:24:30| We've all seen that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=1470)|
| 0:24:33| So we're saving them from that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=1473)|
| 0:24:35| So solutions, things I would really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=1475)|
| 0:24:42| like to see with beer boards, have something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=1482)|
| 0:24:47| in the application paperwork that talks about company policy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=1487)|
| 0:24:51| what it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=1491)|
| 0:24:54| When businesses submit their initial paperwork,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=1494)|
| 0:24:58| they have to submit their company policy at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=1498)|
| 0:25:02| If you guys don't have time to, I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=1502)|
| 0:25:06| know that the inspections unit is kind of busy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=1506)|
| 0:25:09| I know that you guys are kind of busy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=1509)|
| 0:25:12| Karen, the MDC, or I would be happy to look at those policies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=1512)|
| 0:25:17| When they submit their application,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=1517)|
| 0:25:19| send us the policies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=1519)|
| 0:25:21| We could grade them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=1521)|
| 0:25:23| We could put suggestions on them, get them back to you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=1523)|
| 0:25:26| and that could go with the license to the business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=1526)|
| 0:25:31| So if Wanda gets the application,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=1531)|
| 0:25:33| they would forward it to you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=1533)|
| 0:25:34| Is that what you're saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=1534)|
| 0:25:36| No, they just forward the company policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=1536)|
| 0:25:40| The business submits that company policy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=1540)|
| 0:25:42| with their application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=1542)|
| 0:25:44| Wanda gets us that policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=1544)|
| 0:25:47| We go through it, give suggestions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=1547)|
| 0:25:49| get it back to her, and it goes out with their license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=1549)|
| 0:25:52| That way, if you have someone on their first offense,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=1552)|
| 0:25:56| you're able to say, hey, we had your company policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=1556)|
| 0:26:00| We don't want you to write down what you're going to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=1560)|
| 0:26:03| We want you to write down what went wrong| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=1563)|
| 0:26:05| on the first offense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=1565)|
| 0:26:09| That way, you're not chasing offense number two and number| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=1569)|
| 0:26:12| three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=1572)|
| 0:26:16| So little things that we suggest to people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=1576)|
| 0:26:21| Managers look at the ID from any employee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=1581)|
| 0:26:24| that gets an ID that the date of birth is 1996| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=1584)|
| 0:26:28| or has the little red bar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=1588)|
| 0:26:31| Man, we will have this year, hopefully as soon| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=1591)|
| 0:26:35| as I can finish writing it, on our website,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=1595)|
| 0:26:39| we're going to have resources where managers can actually go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=1599)|
| 0:26:42| It's going to be called the Alcohol Compliance Tool,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=1602)|
| 0:26:48| and they will be able to go in and download this sheet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=1608)|
| 0:26:53| and figure out what that we have offered them they want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=1613)|
| 0:26:56| to use as company policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=1616)|
| 0:26:57| And create their own company policy from that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=1617)|
| 0:27:00| So that'll be on the website.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=1620)|
| 0:27:02| You're saying that the driver's license has a red bar saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=1622)|
| 0:27:05| sort of red flag, this one ain't old enough?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=1625)|
| 0:27:08| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=1628)|
| 0:27:08| And they still ignore that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=1628)|
| 0:27:09| And they still don't see it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=1629)|
| 0:27:12| Still don't see it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=1632)|
| 0:27:14| Did Karen erase hers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=1634)|
| 0:27:15| That's what it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=1635)|
| 0:27:16| Karen did, and she still gets served.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=1636)|
| 0:27:20| All right, so as far as training,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=1640)|
| 0:27:22| we have what is called Minors Reducing a Major Liability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=1642)|
| 0:27:25| It is an online program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=1645)|
| 0:27:28| It can be offered through the Metropolitan Drug Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=1648)|
| 0:27:32| or the Knoxville Police Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=1652)|
| 0:27:34| The rate is going to be anywhere from around $8 to $15| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=1654)|
| 0:27:40| per employee, depending upon what type of course| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=1660)|
| 0:27:44| we decide to do, if we decide to do anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=1664)|
| 0:27:48| It could be something that could be required of all businesses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=1668)|
| 0:27:51| and all of their employees before they get their license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=1671)|
| 0:27:56| The biggie with training, as much| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=1676)|
| 0:27:58| as people don't like to say we require training,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=1678)|
| 0:28:01| training fees are tax deductible and fines are not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=1681)|
| 0:28:07| By golly, how much more business friendly can you get than that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=1687)|
| 0:28:11| That's my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=1691)|
| 0:28:14| In doing the new training, I have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=1694)|
| 0:28:16| gotten comments from people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=1696)|
| 0:28:17| I did a training in Blount County, a community training| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=1697)|
| 0:28:20| for all these people that had been popped in a sting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=1700)|
| 0:28:24| And everybody in there said, why didn't somebody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=1704)|
| 0:28:27| teach us all this before?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=1707)|
| 0:28:30| And then we wouldn't be here now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=1710)|
| 0:28:34| So they had had no training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=1714)|
| 0:28:37| I've had, since we've been doing wine and grocery stores,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=1717)|
| 0:28:39| Kroger managers call me all the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=1719)|
| 0:28:41| It's like, this training is wonderful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=1721)|
| 0:28:43| We're catching all these fake IDs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=1723)|
| 0:28:45| We have turned away more underage people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=1725)|
| 0:28:48| They're finding they are excited about it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=1728)|
| 0:28:51| very excited about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=1731)|
| 0:28:54| So that's just kind of some of the things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=1734)|
| 0:28:57| Oh, I had one liquor store that called.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=1737)|
| 0:28:58| And he was all grumbly because his employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=1738)|
| 0:29:00| had to take this course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=1740)|
| 0:29:03| So we get him all set up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=1743)|
| 0:29:04| And then he calls back about an hour later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=1744)|
| 0:29:06| And he said, OK, I need three more courses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=1746)|
| 0:29:09| because I will not have my new employees know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=1749)|
| 0:29:12| more than my old employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=1752)|
| 0:29:14| So he just did the training on his own at that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=1754)|
| 0:29:18| Red bar, there it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=1758)|
| 0:29:19| See on the right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=1759)|
| 0:29:20| That is what you see on an under 21| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=1760)|
| 0:29:23| ID in the state of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=1763)|
| 0:29:26| This is one of the things that we have in our program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=1766)|
| 0:29:28| so that people actually have to pay attention and look at this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=1768)|
| 0:29:34| These are 19-year-olds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=1774)|
| 0:29:35| You have to be very obvious with these children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=1775)|
| 0:29:41| We show them different types of fake ID that they may see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=1781)|
| 0:29:46| Can you all tell what's wrong with that one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=1786)|
| 0:29:48| besides the doctored around the picture?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=1788)|
| 0:29:51| Can you see the doctored around the picture| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=1791)|
| 0:29:53| where they've taken the under 21 route from around| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=1793)|
| 0:29:56| and reprinted it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=1796)|
| 0:29:58| That license is laminated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=1798)|
| 0:30:02| We don't laminate our driver's licenses anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=1802)|
| 0:30:06| We show them this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=1806)|
| 0:30:08| Here's how you look at the year of birth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=1808)|
| 0:30:10| 1996 is the year of fear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=1810)|
| 0:30:13| There you go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=1813)|
| 0:30:14| Mine's laminated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=1814)|
| 0:30:15| What did I do wrong?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=1815)|
| 0:30:16| Let me see it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=1816)|
| 0:30:17| No, not laminated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=1817)|
| 0:30:18| It's like a piece of plastic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=1818)|
| 0:30:19| Yeah, no, this is like your luggage tag laminated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=1819)|
| 0:30:21| Oh, it was handed to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=1821)|
| 0:30:22| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=1822)|
| 0:30:23| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=1823)|
| 0:30:24| So we show them all the fake holograms so that, not all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=1824)|
| 0:30:26| but what we can get a hold of that's out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=1826)|
| 0:30:28| so they know what they're looking at when| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=1828)|
| 0:30:30| they look at fake IDs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=1830)|
| 0:30:31| So we show them all the fake holograms so that, not all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=1831)|
| 0:30:35| but what we can get a hold of that's out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=1835)|
| 0:30:37| so they know what they're looking at when| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=1837)|
| 0:30:39| they look at fake IDs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=1839)|
| 0:30:41| So in a wrap up, come on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=1841)|
| 0:30:46| I thought the key was you get your 21-year-old friend| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=1846)|
| 0:30:49| to buy the beer and you drink it in the parking lot or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=1849)|
| 0:30:53| Well, you can do that too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=1853)|
| 0:30:55| But see, we train against third-party sales as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=1855)|
| 0:30:59| And loitering is against law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=1859)|
| 0:31:02| Lawyering or loitering?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=1862)|
| 0:31:03| Loitering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=1863)|
| 0:31:04| So you can't drink in the parking lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=1864)|
| 0:31:06| because you're loitering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=1866)|
| 0:31:09| So beer boards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=1869)|
| 0:31:11| You guys are like the parents of the beer permit holders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=1871)|
| 0:31:16| OK?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=1876)|
| 0:31:17| You know, if any of you have children,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=1877)|
| 0:31:19| you know if you discipline a child for something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=1879)|
| 0:31:22| not all children, OK?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=1882)|
| 0:31:23| We know not all children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=1883)|
| 0:31:25| But for the good children, you discipline them one time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=1885)|
| 0:31:28| for one thing, and you're not going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=1888)|
| 0:31:30| to have a problem with that again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=1890)|
| 0:31:32| You may have a new problem, but not a problem with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=1892)|
| 0:31:36| Consistency matters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=1896)|
| 0:31:40| As a beer board, every member has to be on the same page.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=1900)|
| 0:31:45| And you kind of have to be on the same page| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=1905)|
| 0:31:48| with your constituents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=1908)|
| 0:31:49| And it needs to be just a, hey, this is community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=1909)|
| 0:31:54| This is safety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=1914)|
| 0:31:55| We're trying to help you stay out of trouble.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=1915)|
| 0:31:59| That's what we're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=1919)|
| 0:32:01| And then, of course, raising the fines| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=1921)|
| 0:32:04| and other requirements showing the businesses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=1924)|
| 0:32:07| the seriousness of selling beer, which is a legal drug.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=1927)|
| 0:32:13| Do you have a recommended fine other than the $500?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=1933)|
| 0:32:20| I'd like $1,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=1940)|
| 0:32:26| I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=1946)|
| 0:32:27| Knox County's gone to $1,000 on the first offense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=1947)|
| 0:32:31| Because they had so many.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=1951)|
| 0:32:32| And they actually, on one meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=1952)|
| 0:32:34| they just went, OK, just to let everybody know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=1954)|
| 0:32:36| we just raised the fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=1956)|
| 0:32:38| Just today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=1958)|
| 0:32:39| Just now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=1959)|
| 0:32:41| In answer to Councilman DeLaValle's question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=1961)|
| 0:32:44| Mr. Frost and I and Ms. Day have all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=1964)|
| 0:32:49| discussed this fine thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=1969)|
| 0:32:51| And Rob, would you like to talk about that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=1971)|
| 0:32:54| Briefly, I have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=1974)|
| 0:32:55| Because I printed off, when did Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=1975)|
| 0:32:57| go to $1,000 for the first offense?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=1977)|
| 0:32:59| Because I printed off their website today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=1979)|
| 0:33:01| and it's $500 for their first offense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=1981)|
| 0:33:04| That's the minimum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=1984)|
| 0:33:07| They have a range?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=1987)|
| 0:33:10| No, it says choice between a 30-day suspension| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=1990)|
| 0:33:13| or a $500 fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=1993)|
| 0:33:16| They did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=1996)|
| 0:33:17| Karen, what was that meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=1997)|
| 0:33:18| I think it was probably in the spring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=1998)|
| 0:33:20| Yeah, it was in the spring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=2000)|
| 0:33:22| It was last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=2002)|
| 0:33:23| I don't know why it's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=2003)|
| 0:33:26| Did they amend their ordinance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=2006)|
| 0:33:29| They may have amended their ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=2009)|
| 0:33:30| and it may not be on the website.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=2010)|
| 0:33:32| It may not be updated, Rob, but I'm going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=2012)|
| 0:33:34| to need the message to respond to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=2014)|
| 0:33:37| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=2017)|
| 0:33:38| Any other questions for Kim?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=2018)|
| 0:33:42| Well, I think now we all understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=2022)|
| 0:33:44| that we don't have red bars around any of our licenses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=2024)|
| 0:33:47| Unfortunately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=2027)|
| 0:33:48| We can go have a beer after this is over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=2028)|
| 0:33:50| And one thing I will offer, if anybody wants to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=2030)|
| 0:33:53| and my card's in the front of the packet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=2033)|
| 0:33:55| There's also an ID coder in the front of the packet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=2035)|
| 0:33:58| and a copy of the, not a copy of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=2038)|
| 0:34:00| but a sample of the manager policy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=2040)|
| 0:34:02| that we are working on and are going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=2042)|
| 0:34:06| to be adding some things to and changing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=2046)|
| 0:34:09| But if you would like to take the carding course| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=2049)|
| 0:34:12| that we do, just email me, and I will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=2052)|
| 0:34:15| be happy to set up a user for you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=2055)|
| 0:34:18| and you can go in and just take it and see what's offered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=2058)|
| 0:34:22| So does it have a receipt at the end| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=2062)|
| 0:34:25| that shows that they watched it all the way through?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=2065)|
| 0:34:28| Is there something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=2068)|
| 0:34:29| They have to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=2069)|
| 0:34:30| There's like two slides, and then there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=2070)|
| 0:34:32| questions about what they've just learned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=2072)|
| 0:34:34| And they go through that way, and then at the end| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=2074)|
| 0:34:36| there's a test that is graded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=2076)|
| 0:34:39| And then they get a certificate saying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=2079)|
| 0:34:41| that they have completed that course and what their score is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=2081)|
| 0:34:44| It's stated in the time stamp or whatever| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=2084)|
| 0:34:46| that they went all the way through it and passed the test?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=2086)|
| 0:34:48| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=2088)|
| 0:34:49| And 70 is a pass or whatever?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=2089)|
| 0:34:51| No, we require 80.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=2091)|
| 0:34:54| So that's your training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=2094)|
| 0:34:55| What about our task class?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=2095)|
| 0:34:57| Are you part of the task class?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=2097)|
| 0:34:59| I am not, but he can answer the task class,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=2099)|
| 0:35:02| because that's classroom training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=2102)|
| 0:35:03| That's not an online.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=2103)|
| 0:35:07| We require everybody that gets a permit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=2107)|
| 0:35:09| to complete the class.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=2109)|
| 0:35:11| Yes, that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=2111)|
| 0:35:13| Anyone who has a beer permit in the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=2113)|
| 0:35:15| of Knoxville, either an owner or manager,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=2115)|
| 0:35:19| is required by city ordinance to show up annually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=2119)|
| 0:35:23| and complete the task class.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=2123)|
| 0:35:25| Are these similar?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=2125)|
| 0:35:27| I mean, what Topshop does?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=2127)|
| 0:35:29| Yes, yes, extremely similar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=2129)|
| 0:35:31| The training that we teach is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=2131)|
| 0:35:39| I just forgot the name of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=2139)|
| 0:35:41| Tennessee Regional Safety Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=2141)|
| 0:35:43| They come up with the curriculum,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=2143)|
| 0:35:45| and we teach straight from that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=2145)|
| 0:35:49| Well, what about the suggestion that was made| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=2149)|
| 0:35:51| that when we have an application for a new permit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=2151)|
| 0:35:55| to share whatever their policy is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=2155)|
| 0:35:58| with either the Metropolitan Drug Commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=2158)|
| 0:36:00| or Top Shelf or someone, some third party,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=2160)|
| 0:36:03| is this cumbersome or good?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=2163)|
| 0:36:05| Well, this is something that we need to talk about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=2165)|
| 0:36:09| having a management policy toward the sale of beer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=2169)|
| 0:36:15| submitted with the application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=2175)|
| 0:36:18| This can become, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=2178)|
| 0:36:20| if somebody's got a 200-page manual| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=2180)|
| 0:36:23| or a 30-page manual that they submit with the application,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=2183)|
| 0:36:26| this becomes somewhat cumbersome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=2186)|
| 0:36:29| I think that that's a good idea personally,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=2189)|
| 0:36:32| but I also know the logistics of it could become unmanageable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=2192)|
| 0:36:38| On the other hand, if, say, when it did not require that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=2198)|
| 0:36:43| but someone does have a violation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=2203)|
| 0:36:46| then have them submit their policies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=2206)|
| 0:36:49| and have the Drug Commission or Top Shelf or someone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=2209)|
| 0:36:53| actually review those to see what they can do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=2213)|
| 0:36:57| to not let this happen again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=2217)|
| 0:37:00| I think the most pathetic...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=2220)|
| 0:37:02| To lay that down in the first place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=2222)|
| 0:37:04| Right. That would be ideal. That would be ideal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=2224)|
| 0:37:06| And that's something the Beer Board will need to discuss.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=2226)|
| 0:37:09| The most pathetic remedial plan we received| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=2229)|
| 0:37:13| was on the back of a piece of receipt from a restaurant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=2233)|
| 0:37:18| and they had jotted down four things they were going to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=2238)|
| 0:37:22| and that was their plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=2242)|
| 0:37:24| We did see them again in a few months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=2244)|
| 0:37:27| So I've talked to Karen about this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=2247)|
| 0:37:30| and the Drug Commission is very willing to review plans for people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=2250)|
| 0:37:36| you know, before they get their permit, after they get their permit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=2256)|
| 0:37:41| after they make a mistake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=2261)|
| 0:37:43| It's all a logistical kind of thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=2263)|
| 0:37:46| and this is something that we probably need to look at in some detail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=2266)|
| 0:37:51| You've got a 30-page plan. I bet they don't read it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=2271)|
| 0:37:54| It would be shorter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=2274)|
| 0:37:56| Can I clarify one thing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=2276)|
| 0:37:57| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=2277)|
| 0:37:58| Actually, what I'm talking about is additional training,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=2278)|
| 0:38:01| which is just a course on how to card, just proper carding techniques.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=2281)|
| 0:38:06| So that's what they're focusing on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=2286)|
| 0:38:08| is just how to look at and read and check out this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=2288)|
| 0:38:13| That's what this course that I'm talking about does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=2293)|
| 0:38:16| So that can be done through the NVC online.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=2296)|
| 0:38:19| It's an inexpensive kind of an option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=2299)|
| 0:38:23| Thank you very much for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=2303)|
| 0:38:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=2305)|
| 0:38:26| Vice Mayor Grieve, did you have a question, or was it answered?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=2306)|
| 0:38:29| Well, partially I have a question for both Kim and Karen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=2309)|
| 0:38:32| I'm just curious over the—| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=2312)|
| 0:38:34| Please lean into the microphone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=2314)|
| 0:38:35| Can you hear me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=2315)|
| 0:38:36| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=2316)|
| 0:38:38| Most of the question was partially answered,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=2318)|
| 0:38:40| but I have a question for Kim and Karen, just out of interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=2320)|
| 0:38:44| Do we have records of the number of DUIs, for instance, that have been given per year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=2324)|
| 0:38:49| I guess maybe that goes to the police department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=2329)|
| 0:38:51| That's number one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=2331)|
| 0:38:52| The other thing I was curious about is that we talk about underage drinking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=2332)|
| 0:38:56| and I know that's what we're concerned about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=2336)|
| 0:38:58| but we're also concerned about the safety in our whole community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=2338)|
| 0:39:01| Have they done studies from, like, people that are 21 to 25 or 21 to 28 or this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=2341)|
| 0:39:07| Is the correlation similar that you see on the charts?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=2347)|
| 0:39:11| Has that been done?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=2351)|
| 0:39:13| I'm just curious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=2353)|
| 0:39:14| I mean, do they grow a brain by 25?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=2354)|
| 0:39:16| Pardon?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=2356)|
| 0:39:17| Do they grow a brain by 25?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=2357)|
| 0:39:18| Well, that's why I'm just curious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=2358)|
| 0:39:20| I mean, back when I was in college, the legal drinking age was 18.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=2360)|
| 0:39:24| Now, whether or not we had our minds or not, I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=2364)|
| 0:39:27| But I'm just curious as to we're concentrating on underage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=2367)|
| 0:39:32| but I'm curious as to what happens from 21 to 25 or 21 to 28,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=2372)|
| 0:39:36| especially with DUIs and this sort of thing in terms of safety in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=2376)|
| 0:39:41| Have those studies been done?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=2381)|
| 0:39:43| Elder?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=2383)|
| 0:39:44| Karen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=2384)|
| 0:39:46| Yeah, I can tell you that there is data available| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=2386)|
| 0:39:49| and research that has been done in the various age groups around DUI.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=2389)|
| 0:39:55| I don't know off the top of my head what the results of those are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=2395)|
| 0:40:00| but I can certainly pull any information that you all would like to have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=2400)|
| 0:40:05| and pull that together and get it to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=2405)|
| 0:40:08| I bet Friday and Saturday night really have a little peak in them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=2408)|
| 0:40:13| Yeah, the weekends are always going to have a higher prevalence, higher rates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=2413)|
| 0:40:18| And then the other question I have has to do with the compliance checks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=2418)|
| 0:40:22| Are we sort of standard with other cities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=2422)|
| 0:40:25| our size in terms of the number of compliance checks we have for this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=2425)|
| 0:40:30| Are we high or are we low?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=2430)|
| 0:40:32| Or what's the situation in terms of us checking?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=2432)|
| 0:40:35| Well, I think you guys do a great job in terms of frequency of checks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=2435)|
| 0:40:41| and the number of businesses that you can get in a check.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=2441)|
| 0:40:45| And I know that TABC works very closely with KPD on those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=2445)|
| 0:40:51| And so they really try to focus and do a real concentrated effort| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=2451)|
| 0:40:56| and hit as many businesses in the time frame that they can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=2456)|
| 0:41:00| I know Sergeant Hunter's goal was to get to two a month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=2460)|
| 0:41:06| to actually go out and do two of these a month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=2466)|
| 0:41:10| So I think you guys, you know, my knowledge is more here local| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=2470)|
| 0:41:15| and just with the two beer boards, the city and the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=2475)|
| 0:41:19| And I can say you all are much more frequent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=2479)|
| 0:41:24| and consistent with your compliance checks than the county is right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=2484)|
| 0:41:30| So I'm happy with how often they're getting out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=2490)|
| 0:41:34| Does the city have more establishments than the county?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=2494)|
| 0:41:38| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=2498)|
| 0:41:39| Is it like twice as much, Nick?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=2499)|
| 0:41:42| Well, I'm not sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=2502)|
| 0:41:44| I mean, I'm sure it is, but I didn't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=2504)|
| 0:41:47| Yeah, you do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=2507)|
| 0:41:48| And we have hit certain spots of the community too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=2508)|
| 0:41:53| like the Old City and the UT area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=2513)|
| 0:41:58| and have done special trainings with Kim on fake IDs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=2518)|
| 0:42:04| because we know in those areas where you have higher concentrations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=2524)|
| 0:42:08| of college age population,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=2528)|
| 0:42:12| they're going to be more likely to get out-of-state IDs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=2532)|
| 0:42:16| which, you know, you can become very familiar with our own IDs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=2536)|
| 0:42:20| But then how do you recognize a fake ID from another state?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=2540)|
| 0:42:25| So we cover all of those things during those trainings too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=2545)|
| 0:42:29| And those, you know, we don't ask them to pay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=2549)|
| 0:42:33| You know, we provide those free.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=2553)|
| 0:42:35| So we've done that for those businesses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=2555)|
| 0:42:37| and tried to promote that as well to really help them out in the college areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=2557)|
| 0:42:45| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=2565)|
| 0:42:46| I noticed that after the drug commission did trainings with particularly the businesses on the strip,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=2566)|
| 0:42:52| that there was a real drop of sales to minors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=2572)|
| 0:42:57| especially from those businesses that had been frequent flyers to the beer board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=2577)|
| 0:43:03| There was a significant drop, and we didn't see them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=2583)|
| 0:43:06| We haven't seen most of them for a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=2586)|
| 0:43:10| So we appreciate what you all do, and we will be looking at some possibilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=2590)|
| 0:43:15| Okay, we have one other presenter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=2595)|
| 0:43:17| Does the officer have anything on the DUI numbers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=2597)|
| 0:43:22| No, I do not, but I can get those numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=2602)|
| 0:43:24| Is that a stat you can get someone to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=2604)|
| 0:43:26| Yes, absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=2606)|
| 0:43:27| Could you do that and then just forward it to the chair?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=2607)|
| 0:43:30| One thing about the DUI numbers, I know this is a concern,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=2610)|
| 0:43:34| but this beer board is concerned with beer permits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=2614)|
| 0:43:40| And if we get into DUIs and some other places, we're really into the weeds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=2620)|
| 0:43:46| And it's not that I'm not interested or thinking it's significant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=2626)|
| 0:43:49| No, I was just curious as to how we are with DUIs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=2629)|
| 0:43:52| Right, right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=2632)|
| 0:43:55| All right, next we have Charlie Jordan, who is with Safe Serve,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=2635)|
| 0:43:59| and we have talked about scanners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=2639)|
| 0:44:01| I know that Councilman Wallace has been very interested in scanners for businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=2641)|
| 0:44:07| So, Mr. Jordan, do you want to tell us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=2647)|
| 0:44:11| Yeah, definitely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=2651)|
| 0:44:12| And I'll actually – I'm going to pass these around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=2652)|
| 0:44:16| There's fake IDs and real IDs scattered within there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=2656)|
| 0:44:21| Let's see here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=2661)|
| 0:44:22| All right, so Safe Serve, what we do is alcohol compliance for businesses that serve alcohol.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=2662)|
| 0:44:33| We also assist with tobacco compliance as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=2673)|
| 0:44:36| as far as being able to make things easy for employees to distinguish the age of the individual| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=2676)|
| 0:44:43| as well as figure out the validity of the ID itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=2683)|
| 0:44:51| Now, our mission is supporting trust in the transaction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=2691)|
| 0:44:58| We are doing more on this in 2017.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=2698)|
| 0:45:03| We actually got our start initially very early in 2016 of last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=2703)|
| 0:45:08| And with supporting trust, our idea there is to create an operational system through our ID readers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=2708)|
| 0:45:19| that creates trust between the business, the business owner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=2719)|
| 0:45:23| the employees that are responsible for making sales within that business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=2723)|
| 0:45:29| and the guests that frequent that business as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=2729)|
| 0:45:33| We think that there's a lot that is being missed across the board from between all three of those sections,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=2733)|
| 0:45:41| and that's what we're trying to tie together with the technology that we have created.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=2741)|
| 0:45:47| Now, as far as the problem, my motivation comes from one of my good friends that's us in October of 2010.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=2747)|
| 0:45:57| That was our senior year of high school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=2757)|
| 0:46:00| And in January of 2011, my friend there, he was able to purchase alcohol, and he didn't come home that night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=2760)|
| 0:46:13| That was my first real introduction to how alcohol sales, especially alcohol sales to a minor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=2773)|
| 0:46:24| can really affect not just an individual but also a community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=2784)|
| 0:46:33| And that was a hard time for me and our two closest friends as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=2793)|
| 0:46:42| But what I've kind of learned from that and what I'm trying to do as far as with SafeServe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=2802)|
| 0:46:49| to make sure that situations like that don't continue or at least don't continue as frequently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=2809)|
| 0:46:55| is by identifying these factors, negligence, fake IDs, and accountability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=2815)|
| 0:47:00| Those are the three things that rule sale to minors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=2820)|
| 0:47:07| Just going into the first one, negligence, some businesses just don't care, and that's a really big issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=2827)|
| 0:47:17| If you think about the term business leader, you expect there to be significant leadership from that individual in a community setting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=2837)|
| 0:47:25| And quite frankly, if you're not going to be a leader and you own a business in a community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=2845)|
| 0:47:30| I don't think you should necessarily be able to operate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=2850)|
| 0:47:35| Now, that being said, there are a lot of people out there that really try and make an effort| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=2855)|
| 0:47:43| towards not selling to minors or to operating properly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=2863)|
| 0:47:48| And sometimes mistakes happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=2868)|
| 0:47:51| There was some research done on 2015 stats with ABC where it was in the 80th percentile| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=2871)|
| 0:47:59| that out of the sale to minor offenses, which there was some 560 offenses in 2015,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=2879)|
| 0:48:06| that in the 80th percentile it was mistake driven.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=2886)|
| 0:48:12| So it was something where either the employee was flustered, didn't check the ID, didn't think to check the ID,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=2892)|
| 0:48:19| or they checked it and for whatever reason they just got the date wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=2899)|
| 0:48:23| But, I mean, again, somebody mentioned it earlier, the fact that sure, that place might be caught that one time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=2903)|
| 0:48:32| but how many other times is this occurring within that establishment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=2912)|
| 0:48:36| And so, yeah, I feel like there is definitely efforts being made, but are they enough?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=2916)|
| 0:48:45| I mean, that's for everybody here to decide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=2925)|
| 0:48:49| Accountability, I think, is a big thing, both on the serving side as well as on this end as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=2929)|
| 0:48:59| I see a lot of cases, not necessarily here, but other places around the state as well as with other states,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=2939)|
| 0:49:05| where a lot of times the minimum is thrown out consistently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=2945)|
| 0:49:10| And that's fine, but if you think about it, with punishment there needs to be examples made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=2950)|
| 0:49:17| That's what really resonates with the individuals that get caught in circumstances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=2957)|
| 0:49:24| And I think that making those statements goes a long way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=2964)|
| 0:49:33| It gets people really thinking about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=2973)|
| 0:49:35| I mean, I think the maximum that a beer board can apply is $2,500 in a fine,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=2975)|
| 0:49:41| and I'm not sure exactly how that falls into place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=2981)|
| 0:49:46| But I'm just saying that I feel that other business owners will really come to resonate with an example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=2986)|
| 0:49:55| I was talking with a business owner in Memphis back in December,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=2995)|
| 0:50:00| and he had a suspension for ten days as far as not being able to serve alcohol,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=3000)|
| 0:50:07| and he said it cost him $1,000 a day for not being able to serve alcohol.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=3007)|
| 0:50:12| His suspension was more painful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=3012)|
| 0:50:15| Right. The suspension is always going to be more painful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=3015)|
| 0:50:19| Now, that being said, also think about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=3019)|
| 0:50:23| If he had also been fined just $1,000, that would have been equivalent to him as a one-day suspension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=3023)|
| 0:50:31| So there's ways to think about these numbers as far as how you gauge how severe the punishment needs to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=3031)|
| 0:50:39| And, sure, it's going to be different with a lot of different businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=3039)|
| 0:50:42| Of course, a liquor store where their sole revenue comes from selling alcohol| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=3042)|
| 0:50:47| compared to a restaurant that's serving food and other items as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=3047)|
| 0:50:51| Those numbers are going to vary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=3051)|
| 0:50:53| The business owner I was talking to in Memphis, he was a restaurant owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=3053)|
| 0:50:57| So thinking about those things as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=3057)|
| 0:51:01| But we just lost connection. Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=3061)|
| 0:51:05| So, anyways, with fake IDs, that is becoming more and more of a prevalent issue nowadays| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=3065)|
| 0:51:16| because they're starting to become very easy to get your hands on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=3076)|
| 0:51:20| Initially in our development, we had reached out to several areas within the community that we were working in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=3080)|
| 0:51:28| to see kind of who had fake IDs that they were willing to let go or what areas we could get those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=3088)|
| 0:51:35| And we also wanted to interview some of those people to figure out where they were purchasing them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=3095)|
| 0:51:39| The number one place is online sales.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=3099)|
| 0:51:42| There's whole Reddit threads, which if you're not familiar with Reddit, it's an online forum,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=3102)|
| 0:51:48| where transactions are made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=3108)|
| 0:51:52| Just off the top of my head, there's YOLO IDs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=3112)|
| 0:51:57| There is IDGod.com.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=3117)|
| 0:52:03| There's all these manufacturers that are online making them under the term of novelty ID as a way of, I guess, trying to skirt the law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=3123)|
| 0:52:14| And they're very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=3134)|
| 0:52:16| I mean, obviously, we've got a few of them there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=3136)|
| 0:52:19| There's, I think, three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=3139)|
| 0:52:20| Mine's in there, actually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=3140)|
| 0:52:21| I forgot about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=3141)|
| 0:52:22| But there's two other real IDs in there, and the rest are all fake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=3142)|
| 0:52:29| And the big thing is with a lot of ID readers nowadays, they'll scan perfectly fine on them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=3149)|
| 0:52:38| And so that's a level of, I guess, of achievement for them as far as being able to have them actually be able to read on a device and show the information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=3158)|
| 0:52:53| I'll get more into that later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=3173)|
| 0:52:55| But, yeah, fake IDs are a big deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=3175)|
| 0:52:58| There's been studies done as far as how they're used in a college scenario.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=3178)|
| 0:53:03| Last I checked, it was 22% of the incoming freshman class will have a fake ID, which is wild, and you can get three for $100.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=3183)|
| 0:53:12| So, I mean, it's just very easy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=3192)|
| 0:53:19| And so that brings me into the solution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=3199)|
| 0:53:23| So we're the first to do a lot of what we've done, and we're okay with that because someone has to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=3203)|
| 0:53:32| So we provide ID readers to businesses, and we package them up to where we try to protect those businesses as best we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=3212)|
| 0:53:43| The thing is if they're using our solution, they're not going to fail a compliance check.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=3223)|
| 0:53:49| There's no reason why they should ever fail a compliance check while using what we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=3229)|
| 0:53:53| And that's part of our goal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=3233)|
| 0:53:55| We want to see those numbers go as close to zero as we can possibly get them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=3235)|
| 0:54:01| And part of our approach is bottom-up and top-down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=3241)|
| 0:54:04| So we go out and do a lot of, like, footwork with businesses to educate them on what we have, how it's unique to their circumstances, and how it can assist them in properly operating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=3244)|
| 0:54:20| And we also have a bottom-down or a top-down, sorry, approach as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=3260)|
| 0:54:26| What we're doing there is we're starting to work a lot more with the distributors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=3266)|
| 0:54:30| And what we're doing there, we're setting up incentivized efforts with the distribution companies so that way those distributors can incentivize their clients,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=3270)|
| 0:54:41| which are your bars and restaurants, to utilize what we have as a way to promote responsible serving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=3281)|
| 0:54:51| Our most recent work with that is Brown Foreman, which is based out of Louisville, and they service a lot of Tennessee-located establishments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=3291)|
| 0:55:00| We create transparent accountability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=3300)|
| 0:55:02| So with our units, what we're able to do is we're able to represent to the business owners or the management,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=3302)|
| 0:55:11| hey, your employees are checking IDs consistently throughout their shifts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=3311)|
| 0:55:17| Each employee signs in with their own unique PIN that's also associated to the expiration of their serving permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=3317)|
| 0:55:27| So, for instance, once their permit expires, they can't utilize the software unless they update their permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=3327)|
| 0:55:34| And part of that is also so we can do some of these studies that a lot of people are asking about tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=3334)|
| 0:55:40| which I think just kind of proves what we're working on even more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=3340)|
| 0:55:45| We're working on providing a lot of the analytics that can provide how many minors are trying to get into a place with their actual ID,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=3345)|
| 0:55:54| how many fake IDs are being used, what the most popular times for a fake ID to be used on any given night,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=3354)|
| 0:56:01| as well as the most popular time where minors are trying to get into places or try to purchase things that they shouldn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=3361)|
| 0:56:08| And so that's something that's to come later on this year that we've currently got in the works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=3368)|
| 0:56:14| Now, I've got busted 91% up there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=3374)|
| 0:56:17| So with fake ID detection, we, right now, the best way to detect a fake ID is with our scanners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=3377)|
| 0:56:28| So what we've done...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=3388)|
| 0:56:30| Is it a phone or is it really a phone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=3390)|
| 0:56:32| It's actually a, it's no longer a phone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=3392)|
| 0:56:36| We utilize hardware that we lock down our software on to kind of protect personal information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=3396)|
| 0:56:42| And so what we're able to do is we read the barcode on the backs of those IDs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=3402)|
| 0:56:48| And with that, there's bar and club stats.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=3408)|
| 0:56:52| There's TCT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=3412)|
| 0:56:53| There's TokenWorks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=3413)|
| 0:56:55| There's all sorts of units out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=3415)|
| 0:56:57| There's LobbyGuard, which I don't know if you guys are familiar with this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=3417)|
| 0:57:01| but that's what Nashville uses in their government offices and the TSA now use as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=3421)|
| 0:57:07| There's also ScanMobi that's in the highway patrol units cars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=3427)|
| 0:57:10| We've tested it against all of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=3430)|
| 0:57:12| And each one of those systems, fake IDs will run through 100%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=3432)|
| 0:57:18| Are you saying they fake the stuff on the front but the barcoding on the back doesn't get faked?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=3438)|
| 0:57:23| The barcoding on the back, it will, what it does is it reads that front.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=3443)|
| 0:57:29| There's a very top layer of information within that barcode.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=3449)|
| 0:57:32| And that's all those things read.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=3452)|
| 0:57:35| For whatever reason, they just didn't decide to put more work into it than that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=3455)|
| 0:57:39| and they left it there, and so massive holes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=3459)|
| 0:57:42| There's also retail pharmacies, the POS programs that scan your ID if you're purchasing Sudafed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=3462)|
| 0:57:47| so they can track it for methamphetamine or the meth check groups.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=3467)|
| 0:57:53| And, I mean, even then, if you had enough fake IDs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=3473)|
| 0:57:58| you more or less purchased as much Sudafed as you wanted to across a certain landscape.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=3478)|
| 0:58:05| So, yeah, one of the things that we're able to do is pick these things out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=3485)|
| 0:58:10| and I can show you here in a little bit how our units pick those up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=3490)|
| 0:58:17| Now, I went in a little bit as far as the who and the what, which is our competition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=3497)|
| 0:58:23| and that leads me into the big picture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=3503)|
| 0:58:26| So what our goal as a business is, I'll go back to being a business leader.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=3506)|
| 0:58:33| Being a leader in the community as well as putting that leadership into even a bigger picture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=3513)|
| 0:58:43| What we expect to do with this, we have a few other use cases| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=3523)|
| 0:58:47| we're going to be implementing over the course of this year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=3527)|
| 0:58:50| and we're going to extract the essence of what makes our technology tick,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=3530)|
| 0:58:56| and we're going to provide it to our competition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=3536)|
| 0:59:00| So the way we see it is not everybody's going to sign up for our stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=3540)|
| 0:59:06| I mean, that's how capitalism works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=3546)|
| 0:59:10| But we want to make sure that everybody has the right equipment installed into their establishment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=3550)|
| 0:59:17| So whether they use us or not, we'll be either in or very close to their establishment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=3557)|
| 0:59:25| And the goal is to try and get these things off the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=3565)|
| 0:59:28| We're trying to work with getting some things changed with the Tennessee legislature| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=3568)|
| 0:59:32| that prevents bars from actually being able to confiscate fake IDs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=3572)|
| 0:59:36| because we definitely feel that that's a good start.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=3576)|
| 0:59:39| A good place to start is to take those off the street because they are way too common.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=3579)|
| 0:59:44| And that goes, again, back to the accountability issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=3584)|
| 0:59:48| It's a Class C or Class A misdemeanor to actually utilize a fake ID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=3588)|
| 0:59:56| And it could be just very well that some examples need to be made| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=3596)|
| 1:00:01| because there's a lot of cases out there where my ID got taken up, I've got two more,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=3601)|
| 1:00:08| or my ID got taken up, I'll just go order more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=3608)|
| 1:00:11| And that doesn't need to be the mentality behind it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=3611)|
| 1:00:15| So, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=3615)|
| 1:00:17| I guess to leave it with that, I'll just kind of go into our squad, which is our team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=3617)|
| 1:00:24| There's myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=3624)|
| 1:00:26| We're all pretty much TTU students minus one individual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=3626)|
| 1:00:31| We've got Shurtash.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=3631)|
| 1:00:32| He's actually a Nepali exchange student.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=3632)|
| 1:00:34| He kind of does all of our tech and security on the back end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=3634)|
| 1:00:40| We've got Jonathan Bradley, who does a lot of our data analyzing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=3640)|
| 1:00:44| very key into being able to produce the statistics we're wanting to provide here in the future very soon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=3644)|
| 1:00:51| We also have Jonathan Ziegler, who is the app design expert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=3651)|
| 1:00:55| He's actually also very key into the process we use to detect fake IDs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=3655)|
| 1:01:02| And then we also just got Michael Walton, who's actually head of manufacturing for Google.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=3662)|
| 1:01:10| And so he's helping us really move forward in our efforts to get this where it needs to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=3670)|
| 1:01:16| so it becomes a very usable product in the marketplace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=3676)|
| 1:01:21| And so with that, I guess I'll open the floor to any questions that you guys might have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=3681)|
| 1:01:26| and show you kind of how our stuff works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=3686)|
| 1:01:30| What's a reader cost?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=3690)|
| 1:01:31| So what it costs right now is if you just want the reader without any liability protection or anything of the sort,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=3691)|
| 1:01:37| it's $30 a month, which is a lot cheaper than a fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=3697)|
| 1:01:42| Per reader?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=3702)|
| 1:01:43| Per reader, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=3703)|
| 1:01:44| There's discounts for if you have, like, over five units in a given establishment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=3704)|
| 1:01:51| And then as well, we offer some liability protection that more or less guarantees that they're protected,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=3711)|
| 1:01:58| as well as the marketing data.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=3718)|
| 1:02:00| And then whenever they have those packages, then it reduces it to $10 a month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=3720)|
| 1:02:04| And you say your reader will detect 91% of the time it'll detect a fake ID?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=3724)|
| 1:02:08| Yes, we're by no means perfect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=3728)|
| 1:02:10| And the big reason to that right now is the fact that we can only be so far up to date| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=3730)|
| 1:02:18| as far as what new technology is out there as far as these IDs are concerned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=3738)|
| 1:02:23| How many do you have in place out there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=3743)|
| 1:02:25| How many readers do you have in place?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=3745)|
| 1:02:29| So we've got, I couldn't tell you the exact number,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=3749)|
| 1:02:33| but we've got somewhere around 40 to 50 units that are actually live currently right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=3753)|
| 1:02:40| Now, and to go back to our percent correctness, the way we've got it set up is every ID that comes through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=3760)|
| 1:02:49| that's scannable that actually has usable data comes through as a real ID initially.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=3769)|
| 1:02:54| And what we have is we have a red flag situation that flags those on our server side| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=3774)|
| 1:02:59| so we can actually detect these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=3779)|
| 1:03:01| Basically, the more areas we're able to find flags for, which part of the difficulty with that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=3781)|
| 1:03:07| is the fact that a lot of states are not up to par with current ID standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=3787)|
| 1:03:14| And so actually by 2018, all 50 states are required to be up to the current standard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=3794)|
| 1:03:22| as far as the data that has to be in those licenses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=3802)|
| 1:03:27| And that will make our jobs a million times easier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=3807)|
| 1:03:29| Plus, we're also working on identifying the front face of the ID as well using some nifty vision APIs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=3809)|
| 1:03:40| And so basically what we'll be able to do there is set key standards across the board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=3820)|
| 1:03:43| for each individual state's IDs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=3823)|
| 1:03:45| Or even, which with those you can do Canada and Mexico driver's license photo IDs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=3825)|
| 1:03:52| and we're actually soon to be implementing passports, visas, those sorts of documents as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=3832)|
| 1:03:57| But what we're going to be doing is setting key indicators on those documents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=3837)|
| 1:04:02| so we can pick out fake IDs or fake documents that as far as the areas that are very hard to print| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=3842)|
| 1:04:11| on a secondary machine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=3851)|
| 1:04:15| Anybody else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=3855)|
| 1:04:17| Okay, so your pricing is on the low end compared to some pricing that we've heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=3857)|
| 1:04:23| We're the most accessible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=3863)|
| 1:04:25| Okay, and do the people who use your service, do they own the reader?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=3865)|
| 1:04:31| Yeah, so actually how it works is whenever they utilize these readers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=3871)|
| 1:04:37| that monthly cost, what that includes is our connection to be able to update these devices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=3877)|
| 1:04:44| So for $30 a month you're getting the reader and you're getting an upgrade every time there's an upgrade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=3884)|
| 1:04:49| Right, and any time we upgrade the hardware too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=3889)|
| 1:04:52| we don't charge them for the upgraded hardware as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=3892)|
| 1:04:55| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=3895)|
| 1:04:56| All right, thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=3896)|
| 1:04:57| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=3897)|
| 1:04:59| All right, we have a, thank you, Charlie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=3899)|
| 1:05:02| We obviously had a lot of information tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=3902)|
| 1:05:04| We need to, I think, give some thought to how we want to proceed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=3904)|
| 1:05:10| Do we want to increase some penalties?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=3910)|
| 1:05:13| Do we want to adjust some requirements?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=3913)|
| 1:05:17| What else do we want to do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=3917)|
| 1:05:19| While we're pondering that for a minute,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=3919)|
| 1:05:21| there is a new permit application that has come to us that we will be addressing at council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=3921)|
| 1:05:27| with an ordinance on Tuesday night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=3927)|
| 1:05:30| We have an application from someone for self-serve beer dispensing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=3930)|
| 1:05:37| Like a Coke machine?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=3937)|
| 1:05:40| Yes, similar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=3940)|
| 1:05:42| And what it would be is when you go into this establishment that has self-serve beer dispensing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=3942)|
| 1:05:48| there would be someone at the door to check your ID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=3948)|
| 1:05:51| You would get a wristband with a number or something on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=3951)|
| 1:05:56| And so you would go up, and let's say there were 15 kinds of craft beers on tap,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=3956)|
| 1:06:01| and you wanted to sample.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=3961)|
| 1:06:03| The maximum amount you could have is 32 ounces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=3963)|
| 1:06:06| And each time you hit the tap, your wristband would be scanned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=3966)|
| 1:06:13| and the maximum would be 32 ounces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=3973)|
| 1:06:17| This is something that is new to the beer serving scene.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=3977)|
| 1:06:24| Nashville has not jumped on that bandwagon,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=3984)|
| 1:06:28| and I don't know of other cities in Tennessee that have jumped on that bandwagon either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=3988)|
| 1:06:36| Our ordinance basically means that beer is only served by the permit holder,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=3996)|
| 1:06:44| an employee, or an agent of the permit holder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=4004)|
| 1:06:49| That would mean a human being.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=4009)|
| 1:06:51| Am I correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=4011)|
| 1:06:55| Put the microphone down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=4015)|
| 1:06:57| That's what we're going to propose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=4017)|
| 1:06:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=4018)|
| 1:06:59| What is it right now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=4019)|
| 1:07:01| It's fairly silent about the situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=4021)|
| 1:07:07| So this is the hottest, newest thing in beer service in South Carolina.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=4027)|
| 1:07:15| The person who's applying the application, I believe, they live in South Carolina,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=4035)|
| 1:07:20| and they would be proposing to open an establishment in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=4040)|
| 1:07:25| Now, this is a whole new field for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=4045)|
| 1:07:31| What if you're PII drunk at 24?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=4051)|
| 1:07:33| You just flash your thingy, and you're going to be fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=4053)|
| 1:07:37| Well, supposedly, according to the permit application, you can only have 32 ounces maximum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=4057)|
| 1:07:44| You could have gone to someplace before that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=4064)|
| 1:07:46| That's true, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=4066)|
| 1:07:48| Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=4068)|
| 1:07:49| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=4069)|
| 1:07:50| I know through experience that they have some of these establishments in Las Vegas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=4070)|
| 1:07:56| and the concept behind it is to minimize loss of the alcohol.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=4076)|
| 1:08:01| It's going to be like pouring a drink that it's all accounted for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=4081)|
| 1:08:07| But I know some of the issues, exactly what you were saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=4087)|
| 1:08:10| go in, have your wristband, leave, and come back later on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=4090)|
| 1:08:17| The bottom line is that we will have an ordinance on the agenda Tuesday night that addresses this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=4097)|
| 1:08:25| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=4105)|
| 1:08:26| What does the state do right now with wineries as far as being able to go in and taste as many wines as you want?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=4106)|
| 1:08:34| I know we were down in New Orleans, and they had a place where it was not only wine testing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=4114)|
| 1:08:38| but it was the same sort of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=4118)|
| 1:08:40| You tested as much as you wanted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=4120)|
| 1:08:42| Does the state have any kind of regulations over that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=4122)|
| 1:08:45| No, the state does not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=4125)|
| 1:08:46| And it is my understanding that there is an establishment on Paper Mill here in Knoxville that serves wine,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=4126)|
| 1:08:53| and it's that kind of a deal where you get a wristband or something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=4133)|
| 1:08:57| and it gauges how much wine you have consumed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=4137)|
| 1:09:02| One in the old city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=4142)|
| 1:09:03| I believe that's called drink.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=4143)|
| 1:09:05| It is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=4145)|
| 1:09:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=4146)|
| 1:09:07| It's called drink.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=4147)|
| 1:09:08| That's a TABC thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=4148)|
| 1:09:10| I just wondered how they do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=4150)|
| 1:09:12| If you all remember, as of January 1st, the beer that the Beer Board regulates is now up to 8%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=4152)|
| 1:09:20| So, I mean, personally, if I had 32 ounces of 8% beer, that probably wouldn't be good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=4160)|
| 1:09:29| Well, it could be good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=4169)|
| 1:09:30| Especially for you, Rob.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=4170)|
| 1:09:34| It could be bad for those of us on the road when you get behind the wheel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=4174)|
| 1:09:38| So that is something that's coming up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=4178)|
| 1:09:40| George, you look like you have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=4180)|
| 1:09:42| I think my comment is that we have a choice whether we want to be reactionary or preventative,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=4182)|
| 1:09:48| and we can put some rules on the front end and make our application tighter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=4188)|
| 1:09:54| and maybe put some things there, or we can react and raise the fines| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=4194)|
| 1:09:59| and put it on the back end should they come forward or both.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=4199)|
| 1:10:03| But I think that money always speaks to the heart,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=4203)|
| 1:10:09| and I would propose that we look at raising the fines and getting them a little bit higher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=4209)|
| 1:10:14| But I think it would be really wise to put some things on the front end and make them submit a plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=4214)|
| 1:10:22| I don't know about sending it off-site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=4222)|
| 1:10:24| I think that would be kind of cumbersome, sending that to someone else to have them review it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=4224)|
| 1:10:28| But, I mean, you can limit it to 150 words or 200 words.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=4228)|
| 1:10:33| They've got to put it in what their plan is and what they're going to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=4233)|
| 1:10:36| But I think you've got to do something to make it a little bit –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=4236)|
| 1:10:40| put a little bit more responsibility on the permit holder,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=4240)|
| 1:10:43| and then if they're going to continue to fail, then up the fines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=4243)|
| 1:10:47| And $500 is just not anything that anybody would be – that you would really worry about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=4247)|
| 1:10:53| I don't see a lot of these people really worrying about having to pay a $500 fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=4253)|
| 1:10:58| Right now the first offense in the city is there is no monetary fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=4258)|
| 1:11:02| It's just a submit your remedial plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=4262)|
| 1:11:06| So maybe we make a first-time offense fine at $500,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=4266)|
| 1:11:10| but also maybe make them submit their plan as part of their application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=4270)|
| 1:11:13| I don't think that would be unfair to say this is how we intend to be part of the application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=4273)|
| 1:11:20| One of the things that we did on the special event permits was to ask them to submit their plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=4280)|
| 1:11:26| because there was a lot of room for inappropriate sales over serving to minors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=4286)|
| 1:11:35| And that hasn't created a problem, has it, Wanda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=4295)|
| 1:11:38| I mean, everybody submits it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=4298)|
| 1:11:40| They don't seem to balk about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=4300)|
| 1:11:42| They either do it or they don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=4302)|
| 1:11:44| So that's certainly something that we need to consider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=4304)|
| 1:11:47| Would it also be good, though, to hear from some of the businesses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=4307)|
| 1:11:50| in terms of where they're coming from?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=4310)|
| 1:11:55| When they apply for a permit or the process?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=4315)|
| 1:12:01| Well, just the whole process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=4321)|
| 1:12:02| I mean, hear from their side also in terms of we want to have some controls| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=4322)|
| 1:12:10| and we want to take care of the issue, but I think also we want to be business friendly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=4330)|
| 1:12:14| and we want to have an understanding in terms of what these folks go through also, I would think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=4334)|
| 1:12:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=4339)|
| 1:12:20| Councilman Pavlis?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=4340)|
| 1:12:21| I mean, I have that concern as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=4341)|
| 1:12:25| You know, the problem, I could be supportive of maybe on the first offense| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=4345)|
| 1:12:32| having a fine associated with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=4352)|
| 1:12:35| But, you know, let's always remember, too, that these servers, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=4355)|
| 1:12:41| you could have the best training in the world and the best program out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=4361)|
| 1:12:45| and these servers, some of them, they just don't care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=4365)|
| 1:12:49| They don't want to follow the rules no matter what.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=4369)|
| 1:12:52| So what happens is, you know, we jack up these fines way up high,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=4372)|
| 1:12:58| and the business owner and the businesses are left with that bill,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=4378)|
| 1:13:03| but the server, I can guarantee you, I will guarantee you, nine out of ten times,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=4383)|
| 1:13:08| probably within a day, is going to have another job served| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=4388)|
| 1:13:12| because that's just the way that industry works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=4392)|
| 1:13:14| And so here they go with nothing happens to them other than they just change jobs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=4394)|
| 1:13:19| and get a whole bunch of new friends.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=4399)|
| 1:13:21| But the business is left behind with that money that they have to pay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=4401)|
| 1:13:27| So it's a slippery slope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=4407)|
| 1:13:30| We need to be cognizant of the fact that, you know, it's not business friendly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=4410)|
| 1:13:36| But we're not here just to be business friendly because we're making mistakes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=4416)|
| 1:13:40| But if they've got a good plan, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=4420)|
| 1:13:42| you've got to look at the whole picture of what's their history and all that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=4422)|
| 1:13:46| Well, and ultimately the servers, they will see some consequences and repercussions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=4426)|
| 1:13:54| if they are in fact caught serving to underage, that sort of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=4434)|
| 1:14:00| Eventually the state will revoke their server permit and stuff like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=4440)|
| 1:14:06| And that way, if they do not have a server permit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=4446)|
| 1:14:10| then they're not supposed to be able to serve liquor by the drink and things of that nature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=4450)|
| 1:14:16| But you do make a great point about holding these servers accountable and stuff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=4456)|
| 1:14:24| because there needs to be something there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=4464)|
| 1:14:27| So how is that done? I mean, is a server?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=4467)|
| 1:14:31| Well, basically when we catch them at an over-serve compliance check,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=4471)|
| 1:14:38| or not over-serve but a compliance check,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=4478)|
| 1:14:40| we issue them a misdemeanor citation for a sale of alcohol to a minor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=4480)|
| 1:14:47| And then, of course, it's going through state court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=4487)|
| 1:14:50| And it's going to be up to the state court to determine what sort of penalties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=4490)|
| 1:14:56| or punishments they might get for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=4496)|
| 1:15:00| Possibly could be a situation where council decides to maybe impose some fines on them as well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=4500)|
| 1:15:09| at the local level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=4509)|
| 1:15:12| So you don't know what the parameters are of the state, how many times if they get caught?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=4512)|
| 1:15:18| If they get caught the first time, ultimately they will lose that permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=4518)|
| 1:15:25| Well, I know, but ultimately what's the season?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=4525)|
| 1:15:29| No, the first time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=4529)|
| 1:15:31| If they get caught selling to underage, the state will take their permit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=4531)|
| 1:15:36| but it may take the state a little bit to getting the permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=4536)|
| 1:15:43| But that's only for TABC?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=4543)|
| 1:15:46| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=4546)|
| 1:15:47| For alcohol, I mean for spirits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=4547)|
| 1:15:48| For liquor by the drink.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=4548)|
| 1:15:49| For spirits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=4549)|
| 1:15:50| We're just dealing with beer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=4550)|
| 1:15:52| They are cited to court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=4552)|
| 1:15:54| The district attorney does deal with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=4554)|
| 1:15:56| I think one concern that we see is sometimes on first offenses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=4556)|
| 1:15:59| the district attorney's office, they have a lot of cases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=4559)|
| 1:16:02| And so sometimes on first offenses they'll dismiss it as far as they won't have an actual violation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=4562)|
| 1:16:09| so long as they meet certain conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=4569)|
| 1:16:11| And so they might, if it's dismissed on payment of costs or some other type of resolution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=4571)|
| 1:16:18| then they won't eventually get up to the ABC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=4578)|
| 1:16:21| And so what I think Sergeant Coward's saying is at some point after a certain number of violations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=4581)|
| 1:16:25| if they're convicted, because ABC's not going to take a permit until the conviction happens,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=4585)|
| 1:16:30| because you're innocent until proven guilty, it's a process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=4590)|
| 1:16:34| It takes time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=4594)|
| 1:16:35| So then we're back to square one in that it really doesn't sound like it's a very effective plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=4595)|
| 1:16:41| And I understand the burden on the courts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=4601)|
| 1:16:43| but, again, let's just be careful talking about raising the fines out of the roof for the businesses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=4603)|
| 1:16:51| because they can have the best plan in the world, but it's just going to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=4611)|
| 1:16:55| I'm going to tell you right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=4615)|
| 1:16:56| Your fines and costs, I mean, I'll practice in criminal court,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=4616)|
| 1:16:59| but probably your fines and costs, like Ms. Dyer mentioned, to get it dismissed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=4619)|
| 1:17:03| that can be $200 or $300 on the server.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=4623)|
| 1:17:08| And we don't require employees to be terminated as part of punishment for the business owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=4628)|
| 1:17:14| A lot of businesses, that is their practice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=4634)|
| 1:17:16| They're going to terminate them immediately and move on to their next employee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=4636)|
| 1:17:19| But that's never been something that we've required as part of an agreed order or as part of punishment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=4639)|
| 1:17:25| We do try to figure out where the business went wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=4645)|
| 1:17:28| And if the business went wrong because they aren't checking the IDs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=4648)|
| 1:17:31| a lot of times in our agreed orders we'll have an agreed order where they go and buy a scanner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=4651)|
| 1:17:36| as part of their agreement with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=4656)|
| 1:17:39| I like to have a combination of suspension and fines as part of our agreed orders| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=4659)|
| 1:17:45| because businesses' suspensions scare them much more than the fines do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=4665)|
| 1:17:49| The only concern I have about having a fine on the first offense the way we currently have it drafted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=4669)|
| 1:17:56| is we need to have a due process component.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=4676)|
| 1:17:58| If we decide that we're going to increase the fine on the first offense,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=4678)|
| 1:18:01| which I think is something you all are thinking about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=4681)|
| 1:18:03| we'll just need to tweak it so that they have the opportunity to go to a hearing if they want to dispute that fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=4683)|
| 1:18:08| We don't have that right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=4688)|
| 1:18:10| Well, I mean, and that's been my position all along.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=4690)|
| 1:18:13| I think it's wrong for them to just have the policy, you get fired on the spot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=4693)|
| 1:18:17| Well, what if that's a, you know, some servers are professional servers and that's what they do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=4697)|
| 1:18:22| and they want to stay at Calhoun's or they want to stay wherever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=4702)|
| 1:18:26| and they make that one mistake and then, bam, you're done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=4706)|
| 1:18:30| And I think that's wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=4710)|
| 1:18:32| I think it's a bad policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=4712)|
| 1:18:34| I can't control their policies, but I think train them a little bit more, work with them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=4714)|
| 1:18:39| keep the good employees because it costs a lot of money to keep training these employees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=4719)|
| 1:18:43| and they go right down the street, and I promise you within a day they probably got another job serving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=4723)|
| 1:18:49| We had a convenience store owner that had been with the company for, what, 25 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=4729)|
| 1:18:55| Pull the microphone down, please, so we can hear you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=4735)|
| 1:18:58| We had a convenience store owner, remember, that had been with the company 20, 25 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=4738)|
| 1:19:03| and first time, and he was out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=4743)|
| 1:19:06| And I'll just speak for the law department because we represent you all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=4746)|
| 1:19:09| when we move to the process with the hearing officer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=4749)|
| 1:19:11| We don't require them to terminate the employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=4751)|
| 1:19:14| That is something certainly that they offer it up, and if they tell us they've done it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=4754)|
| 1:19:18| we'll incorporate it into our agreed order, but we don't require it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=4758)|
| 1:19:21| We often include additional equipment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=4761)|
| 1:19:24| We often include training, and we always have a suspension and a fine as part of the agreed order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=4764)|
| 1:19:30| One of the things that, as much as we would like to do it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=4770)|
| 1:19:33| we can't control what an owner decides to do with an employee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=4773)|
| 1:19:38| whether they decide to fire them or they decide to retain them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=4778)|
| 1:19:42| That's really into the weeds for what we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=4782)|
| 1:19:45| But what we can do as a beer board is really encourage people, when they apply for the permit, to have a plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=4785)|
| 1:19:52| How are you going to train your employees?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=4792)|
| 1:19:55| How are you going to be trained?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=4795)|
| 1:19:57| What's your game plan here on service?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=4797)|
| 1:19:59| And it sounds to me like that that's something this beer board is interested in moving forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=4799)|
| 1:20:06| Could you email your thoughts on that to Will?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=4806)|
| 1:20:13| He's been silent tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=4813)|
| 1:20:15| Or to Rob, either one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=4815)|
| 1:20:17| We can come up with some suggestions, not this beer board meeting in February,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=4817)|
| 1:20:22| but in the March beer board meeting, come up with some ideas at the beer board meeting and move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=4822)|
| 1:20:30| Does that sound like a plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=4830)|
| 1:20:32| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=4832)|
| 1:20:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=4833)|
| 1:20:34| I said that we would only take 75 minutes, and I fibbed because we've now taken 81.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=4834)|
| 1:20:38| So if there is no other business, we can adjourn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170112?start=4838)|
