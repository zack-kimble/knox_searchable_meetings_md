| 0:01:29| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=89)|
| 0:01:30| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=90)|
| 0:01:31| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=91)|
| 0:01:32| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=92)|
| 0:01:33| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=93)|
| 0:01:34| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=94)|

| 0:01:43| Councilwoman Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=103)|
| 0:01:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=104)|
| 0:01:45| 12A, the corridor overlay, has been circulating since 2010.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=105)|
| 0:01:53| And I'm proposing that we need to circulate it 180 more days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=113)|
| 0:01:58| so that we can massage some of the points of contention| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=118)|
| 0:02:01| and have the absolute best ordinance that we can have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=121)|
| 0:02:04| as opposed to one that has some good points, some less| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=124)|
| 0:02:08| good points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=128)|
| 0:02:09| So I'm requesting that we postpone this 180 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=129)|
| 0:02:13| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=133)|
| 0:02:14| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=134)|
| 0:02:15| Any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=135)|
| 0:02:17| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=137)|
| 0:02:18| That's postponing the corridor overlay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=138)|
| 0:02:20| which is 12A on our agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=140)|
| 0:02:23| All in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=143)|
| 0:02:24| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=144)|
| 0:02:25| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=145)|
| 0:02:26| The ayes have it, and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=146)|
| 0:02:28| Anything else for postponement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=148)|
| 0:02:30| Items to be added by motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=150)|
| 0:02:33| Consent items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=153)|
| 0:02:34| We have 11T, which is a certificate of compliance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=154)|
| 0:02:38| 11U through W are pensions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=158)|
| 0:02:41| And 12B through F are 202s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=161)|
| 0:02:45| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=165)|
| 0:02:46| All in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=166)|
| 0:02:48| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=168)|
| 0:02:48| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=168)|
| 0:02:49| The ayes have it, and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=169)|
| 0:02:51| For the mayor's report, I first want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=171)|
| 0:02:53| to share with you all that I had the pleasure yesterday| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=173)|
| 0:02:56| of joining Chief Stan Sharp, our fire chief,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=176)|
| 0:02:59| for the presentation of the Firefighter of the Quarter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=179)|
| 0:03:02| Award to Senior Firefighter Corey Darnell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=182)|
| 0:03:06| Corey has been with the fire department for four years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=186)|
| 0:03:09| And this winter, one day while he was off duty,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=189)|
| 0:03:13| he saw a man who had collapsed while jogging| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=193)|
| 0:03:16| at a park in Oak Ridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=196)|
| 0:03:18| Corey just happened to be driving by,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=198)|
| 0:03:20| and he immediately called 911.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=200)|
| 0:03:23| And then he rushed to help the man,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=203)|
| 0:03:25| and he performed CPR while waiting for the ambulance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=205)|
| 0:03:28| Turned out that the gentleman had a heart attack,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=208)|
| 0:03:31| and the doctors credit Corey's quick action| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=211)|
| 0:03:34| with saving his life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=214)|
| 0:03:36| And he has a wife, children, and actually his family was there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=216)|
| 0:03:42| And it was a very touching moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=222)|
| 0:03:44| I mean, we did the formal stuff, and then the family| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=224)|
| 0:03:46| just spoke in his honor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=226)|
| 0:03:48| It was really quite amazing to see the gratitude from all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=228)|
| 0:03:53| of the family members for the quick action that Corey took.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=233)|
| 0:03:57| And so we talk a lot about the time and effort and expense| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=237)|
| 0:04:01| that goes into the training of all of our city workers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=241)|
| 0:04:05| and especially our emergency responders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=245)|
| 0:04:07| But it's not until you hear about an incident like this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=247)|
| 0:04:11| that you really understand what it means.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=251)|
| 0:04:13| And this is while he was even off duty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=253)|
| 0:04:15| So we are talking literally about the difference| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=255)|
| 0:04:18| between life and death.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=258)|
| 0:04:19| And Corey certainly saw it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=259)|
| 0:04:21| And I know he said that he really represented| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=261)|
| 0:04:23| all of his fellow firefighters and emergency responders| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=263)|
| 0:04:28| with the action and with the recognition that he got.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=268)|
| 0:04:32| And he also reflects them with the actions that he took.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=272)|
| 0:04:35| So we congratulate Corey again for the recognition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=275)|
| 0:04:39| And we also want to thank all of our dedicated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=279)|
| 0:04:42| uniformed employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=282)|
| 0:04:44| So you all remember that as part of this year's budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=284)|
| 0:04:56| I proposed and you approved $500,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=296)|
| 0:04:59| to create a fund for historic preservation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=299)|
| 0:05:02| Next Tuesday, July 29th at 5.30 PM,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=302)|
| 0:05:09| we will hold a public meeting at the East Tennessee History| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=309)|
| 0:05:12| Center to solicit input and ideas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=312)|
| 0:05:15| on how we can best use that money to protect and redevelop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=315)|
| 0:05:19| historic properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=319)|
| 0:05:21| Becky Wade, our community development director,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=321)|
| 0:05:24| will lead that meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=324)|
| 0:05:25| And her department already oversees several programs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=325)|
| 0:05:28| that have had preservation success,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=328)|
| 0:05:31| including our commercial facade grants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=331)|
| 0:05:33| and our blighted property redevelopment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=333)|
| 0:05:34| program, among others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=334)|
| 0:05:37| There are various ways this money could be applied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=337)|
| 0:05:40| And we've got some ideas of our own as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=340)|
| 0:05:43| But we really want to hear first from property owners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=343)|
| 0:05:45| developers, preservationists, anyone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=345)|
| 0:05:48| with a passion for protecting the legacy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=348)|
| 0:05:50| of our historic properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=350)|
| 0:05:52| So please come out Tuesday the 29th at 5.30| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=352)|
| 0:05:55| at the East Tennessee History Center on Gay Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=355)|
| 0:05:58| And if you can't make that meeting, email Becky| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=358)|
| 0:06:01| and share ideas as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=361)|
| 0:06:04| And one other thing to call to your attention,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=364)|
| 0:06:06| we have just published our new Greenways map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=366)|

| 0:06:11| Here's one right here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=371)|
| 0:06:13| And you all should have one around the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=373)|

| 0:06:32| It's really very well done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=392)|
| 0:06:33| I really appreciate our Parks and Recreation Department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=393)|
| 0:06:37| doing this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=397)|
| 0:06:38| It's attractive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=398)|
| 0:06:39| It invites you to get out there and get on the greenways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=399)|
| 0:06:44| And copies of this are available at our recreation centers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=404)|

| 0:06:51| And if you really want a copy and you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=411)|

| 0:09:56| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=596)|
| 0:09:56| Councilman Del Valle, how about, would you like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=596)|
| 0:09:58| I was going to have maybe Christy give a little background| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=598)|
| 0:10:01| first, would that be good?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=601)|
| 0:10:02| OK, and then see what questions you have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=602)|
| 0:10:05| Christy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=605)|
| 0:10:05| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=605)|
| 0:10:06| So we have, this is really a matter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=606)|
| 0:10:09| of formalizing the terms under which we already| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=609)|
| 0:10:11| work under both of these agreements for Innovation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=611)|
| 0:10:14| Valley, which handles our economic development and jobs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=614)|
| 0:10:19| and creation through a regional approach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=619)|
| 0:10:22| And then the Knoxville Chamber, of course,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=622)|
| 0:10:23| offers those services for the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=623)|
| 0:10:26| And Rhonda Rice and Doug Lawyer are here this evening| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=626)|
| 0:10:28| to answer questions for you as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=628)|
| 0:10:31| The first one is for Innovation Valley, the first agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=631)|
| 0:10:33| And the second one that we are proposing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=633)|
| 0:10:35| is for the Knoxville Chamber.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=635)|
| 0:10:37| These have been handled in the past as services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=637)|
| 0:10:40| that were provided under a line item in our city of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=640)|
| 0:10:43| budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=643)|
| 0:10:44| This is simply formalizing the terms under which we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=644)|
| 0:10:47| work with this group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=647)|
| 0:10:49| I think it's just good to communicate what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=649)|
| 0:10:51| the expectations are and to help all of us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=651)|
| 0:10:53| understand and better define the relationship.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=653)|
| 0:10:57| Councilman Illamofi?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=657)|
| 0:10:58| If I would key off that, maybe we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=658)|
| 0:11:00| can have Rhonda or one of the other folks step up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=660)|
| 0:11:03| I just wanted to know a little bit of the difference| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=663)|
| 0:11:06| between the two agreements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=666)|
| 0:11:07| In other words, why is Innovation Valley| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=667)|
| 0:11:10| broken out separate and the Chamber money's different?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=670)|
| 0:11:15| And I'm sure she can tell us, and that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=675)|
| 0:11:16| would be great to know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=676)|
| 0:11:18| Sure, Rhonda Rice, 17 Market Square, 37920.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=678)|
| 0:11:23| To answer the first part of your question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=683)|
| 0:11:25| Councilman, is the fact that the Knoxville Chamber| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=685)|
| 0:11:28| existed before the regional economic development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=688)|
| 0:11:31| approach for Innovation Valley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=691)|
| 0:11:33| And so that agreement was in place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=693)|
| 0:11:36| and was a part of the mayor's line item budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=696)|
| 0:11:39| as Christy said earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=699)|
| 0:11:41| Then when the regional initiative came in line,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=701)|
| 0:11:44| that is a much broader scope of services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=704)|
| 0:11:47| in what we do throughout the region here in East Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=707)|
| 0:11:50| and covering not only the city of Knoxville and Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=710)|
| 0:11:53| but six counties throughout our area here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=713)|
| 0:11:56| So it's the same staff providing you the benefit of services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=716)|
| 0:12:02| And we feel like the Chamber, we are the economic development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=722)|
| 0:12:06| agency for the mayor and for the city of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=726)|
| 0:12:08| in providing those services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=728)|
| 0:12:10| All right, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=730)|
| 0:12:11| Y'all had a recently interesting land use seminar| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=731)|
| 0:12:16| with a consultant who was explaining| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=736)|
| 0:12:18| how it's important to have a land base to market| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=738)|
| 0:12:22| your community to the business world.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=742)|
| 0:12:24| That was interesting and helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=744)|
| 0:12:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=746)|
| 0:12:27| And just as a follow up to that, we are taking that information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=747)|
| 0:12:31| I appreciate those of you who were able to attend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=751)|
| 0:12:35| But we are taking that and creating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=755)|
| 0:12:36| an executive summary of that information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=756)|
| 0:12:39| And we'll share with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=759)|
| 0:12:40| And then, as always, happy to come back and provide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=760)|
| 0:12:43| further discussion on that land use study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=763)|
| 0:12:47| And hopefully, you'll tell us about getting those ones that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=767)|
| 0:12:50| were good up to the excellent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=770)|
| 0:12:51| Well, that's exactly part of the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=771)|
| 0:12:53| And that actually gave us that direction of saying, OK,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=773)|
| 0:12:57| here's how you get, to use the coin phrase, from good to great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=777)|
| 0:13:02| OK, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=782)|
| 0:13:03| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=783)|
| 0:13:03| Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=783)|
| 0:13:04| Yeah, thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=784)|
| 0:13:05| And I just want to say that of the items that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=785)|
| 0:13:08| are on the agenda tonight, this is two very important| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=788)|
| 0:13:11| initiatives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=791)|
| 0:13:12| And I appreciate you, Mayor, and Christy, and others,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=792)|
| 0:13:16| meeting with the chamber every two weeks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=796)|
| 0:13:18| setting goals, holding them accountable to what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=798)|
| 0:13:20| we're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=800)|
| 0:13:21| There's nothing more important that will benefit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=801)|
| 0:13:23| long-term in Knoxville, and that's creating jobs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=803)|
| 0:13:25| and bringing jobs to Knoxville, and then retaining| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=805)|
| 0:13:27| the ones that are here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=807)|
| 0:13:29| It's a big initiative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=809)|
| 0:13:30| It's a long-term benefit, and it takes a lot of work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=810)|
| 0:13:34| And there's just not anything more important| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=814)|
| 0:13:36| that benefits the city of Knoxville than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=816)|
| 0:13:39| So my full support, and as much as I support Innovation Valley| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=819)|
| 0:13:45| and have our own company of support at Innovation Valley,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=825)|
| 0:13:48| I'm really important about what happens| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=828)|
| 0:13:50| inside the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=830)|
| 0:13:51| That's the ones that are really going to benefit us the most,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=831)|
| 0:13:54| and I think really take a lot more effort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=834)|
| 0:13:57| And we've talked about that, and so kudos and hammer down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=837)|
| 0:14:02| I think the timing is right, especially for jobs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=842)|
| 0:14:05| to be attracted to Knoxville for many, many different| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=845)|
| 0:14:08| reasons, so thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=848)|
| 0:14:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=849)|
| 0:14:10| Councilwoman Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=850)|
| 0:14:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=851)|
| 0:14:12| Councilman Wallace, you stole my thunder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=852)|
| 0:14:14| I try to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=854)|
| 0:14:16| You can repeat the nice things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=856)|
| 0:14:18| Innovation Valley has the regional approach,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=858)|
| 0:14:21| and even though the jobs might not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=861)|
| 0:14:23| be in the city limits of Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=863)|
| 0:14:26| we do benefit because people come here and spend money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=866)|
| 0:14:29| They buy houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=869)|
| 0:14:30| They live downtown, do all these things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=870)|
| 0:14:33| and we experience the revenue benefits of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=873)|
| 0:14:37| and that's important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=877)|
| 0:14:38| I also like the fact that the meetings are occurring| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=878)|
| 0:14:40| every couple of weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=880)|
| 0:14:42| For several years, I've wanted, I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=882)|
| 0:14:44| a big accountability person, except for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=884)|
| 0:14:49| I'm just glad that we're looking at these things more seriously,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=889)|
| 0:14:52| and I think that the chamber and Innovation Valley| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=892)|
| 0:14:54| are working well together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=894)|
| 0:14:56| And we hear, as we meet with different groups,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=896)|
| 0:14:58| how important it is to bring jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=898)|
| 0:15:00| It's like all nine of us and the mayor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=900)|
| 0:15:02| are supposed to be bringing 100,000 jobs to the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=902)|
| 0:15:05| of Knoxville yesterday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=905)|
| 0:15:06| That's a little exaggeration, but I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=906)|
| 0:15:08| think that Innovation Valley and the chamber with their work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=908)|
| 0:15:11| are doing the kinds of things to bring quality jobs that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=911)|
| 0:15:14| pay well to the city of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=914)|
| 0:15:18| as well as the entire region.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=918)|
| 0:15:19| So I applaud this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=919)|
| 0:15:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=921)|
| 0:15:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=922)|
| 0:15:23| Councilman Grieve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=923)|
| 0:15:25| I agree with both what my colleagues had to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=925)|
| 0:15:27| but I'm curious, what does the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=927)|
| 0:15:30| give to Innovation Valley and the other counties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=930)|
| 0:15:34| as far as financial and then also to the chamber?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=934)|
| 0:15:37| All the counties in Innovation Valley| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=937)|
| 0:15:40| are participants in funding different levels of amounts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=940)|
| 0:15:44| anywhere from $5,000 up to $30,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=944)|
| 0:15:48| for the different counties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=948)|
| 0:15:50| And then Knox County for Innovation Valley| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=950)|
| 0:15:53| is a $250,000 contract, and to the chamber| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=953)|
| 0:15:55| is an $80,000 contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=955)|
| 0:15:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=958)|
| 0:16:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=960)|
| 0:16:01| Any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=961)|
| 0:16:02| I just want to make one comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=962)|
| 0:16:03| I just want to thank Chip Berry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=963)|
| 0:16:05| He worked very hard on helping us get these documents together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=965)|
| 0:16:08| And Chip's here in the audience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=968)|
| 0:16:09| I just want to know how much I appreciate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=969)|
| 0:16:11| all his hard work on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=971)|
| 0:16:12| Thank you, Chip.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=972)|
| 0:16:14| Mayor, if I may, I just want to reiterate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=974)|
| 0:16:16| what a couple of council folks said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=976)|
| 0:16:18| We do meet with the mayor and senior staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=978)|
| 0:16:20| every other Tuesday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=980)|
| 0:16:22| It's a meeting where we openly discuss| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=982)|
| 0:16:26| what we can try to do to make our economy better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=986)|
| 0:16:30| And at the same time, many of you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=990)|
| 0:16:32| and the mayor's senior staff and many of the offices| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=992)|
| 0:16:35| within the city of Knoxville are very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=995)|
| 0:16:37| responsive to our needs when we call and ask questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=997)|
| 0:16:41| whether it has to do with permitting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=1001)|
| 0:16:43| or a number of other initiatives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=1003)|
| 0:16:46| And sometimes we have to even call in the chief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=1006)|
| 0:16:48| So we appreciate both of you all in your support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=1008)|
| 0:16:51| So we just want to thank you for that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=1011)|
| 0:16:52| and thank you for the opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=1012)|
| 0:16:55| I want to add, when we meet every two weeks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=1015)|
| 0:16:57| it's typically on council day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=1017)|
| 0:16:59| And not only is it just us meeting with the chamber| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=1019)|
| 0:17:04| and Development Corp and Innovation Valley,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=1024)|
| 0:17:07| all representatives, we also have Alvin Nance from KCDC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=1027)|
| 0:17:12| Our redevelopment team is there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=1032)|
| 0:17:14| And Becky Wade in community development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=1034)|
| 0:17:17| Christy and Bill, I don't know who else I left out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=1037)|
| 0:17:21| And the idea is that we all know what's going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=1041)|
| 0:17:23| So the economic development folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=1043)|
| 0:17:26| need to know what we're hearing on the redevelopment side| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=1046)|
| 0:17:29| and community development, all of that together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=1049)|
| 0:17:32| So to make sure that we're all in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=1052)|
| 0:17:35| use the word that's around now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=1055)|
| 0:17:36| we're all in alignment with what's going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=1056)|
| 0:17:38| And so I think that's a big, important piece of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=1058)|
| 0:17:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=1062)|
| 0:17:43| Councilman Stair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=1063)|
| 0:17:44| Thank you, mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=1064)|
| 0:17:45| And I noticed, I don't know if these are new or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=1065)|
| 0:17:47| but I noticed there's quarterly reports in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=1067)|
| 0:17:50| Would council be able to be included on those as well?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=1070)|
| 0:17:54| Absolutely, councilman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=1074)|
| 0:17:55| What we do is in the model that we've approached| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=1075)|
| 0:17:57| is the same that we do with some of our other agencies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=1077)|
| 0:17:59| We provide quarterly reports based on the metrics| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=1079)|
| 0:18:03| that are in our agreement as also,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=1083)|
| 0:18:05| as well as you do receive the stakeholders reports.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=1085)|
| 0:18:11| Right, the Innovation Valley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=1091)|
| 0:18:12| Right, I remember receiving that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=1092)|
| 0:18:14| That was very helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=1094)|
| 0:18:15| Right, and so those are the same,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=1095)|
| 0:18:16| similar things that you will receive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=1096)|
| 0:18:20| And as always, anytime you have questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=1100)|
| 0:18:21| please let us know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=1101)|
| 0:18:22| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=1102)|
| 0:18:23| Okay, great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=1103)|
| 0:18:24| So we're on 11B.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=1104)|
| 0:18:27| We already have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=1107)|
| 0:18:29| All in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=1109)|
| 0:18:30| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=1110)|
| 0:18:31| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=1111)|
| 0:18:32| The ayes have it and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=1112)|

| 0:20:07| Thank you, Jenny Weatherstone, 511 North Broadway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=1207)|
| 0:20:10| Knoxville, 37917.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=1210)|
| 0:20:12| And I thank you for approving this tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=1212)|
| 0:20:16| We are very proud of what we do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=1216)|
| 0:20:19| at the Volunteer Ministry Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=1219)|
| 0:20:21| The mission, as you know, is to both prevent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=1221)|
| 0:20:24| and end homelessness and these funds do just that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=1224)|
| 0:20:28| I think to recap a little bit, I will tell you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=1228)|
| 0:20:31| that when we work with someone through case management,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=1231)|
| 0:20:35| which again, you have just helped to fund,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=1235)|
| 0:20:37| and we help them into housing, we have a 94% success rate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=1237)|
| 0:20:41| in terms of them maintaining that housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=1241)|
| 0:20:44| Men Villa, which also you are helping with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=1244)|
| 0:20:48| in terms of helping with the support services,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=1248)|
| 0:20:53| I think has been an unqualified success.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=1253)|
| 0:20:58| There are 57 units last year because of some attrition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=1258)|
| 0:21:02| some people being able to move out to independent housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=1262)|
| 0:21:05| There were a total of 66 individuals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=1265)|
| 0:21:08| who received services through Men Villa.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=1268)|
| 0:21:12| These are folks who are off the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=1272)|
| 0:21:14| So one by one, I think we are doing the work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=1274)|
| 0:21:18| of ending homelessness in Knoxville, and I thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=1278)|

| 0:24:19| Typically our funds go for supplies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=1459)|
| 0:24:22| and then some contracted work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=1462)|
| 0:24:24| that has to be done by licensed contractors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=1464)|
| 0:24:27| but they do a lot of their work in the spring,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=1467)|
| 0:24:29| in the summer with student volunteers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=1469)|
| 0:24:32| So although they're accomplishing the same type of work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=1472)|
| 0:24:35| they do it in a little bit different fashion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=1475)|
| 0:24:38| So you're supporting the activity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=1478)|
| 0:24:40| that these volunteer groups are doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=1480)|
| 0:24:42| Is any of this money sort of evergreening| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=1482)|
| 0:24:44| or is that only in the CAC kind of program?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=1484)|
| 0:24:48| Evergreening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=1488)|

| 0:24:51| none of this is loan work, it's all just done for the home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=1491)|
| 0:24:55| Yes, yes, and there's certainly the need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=1495)|
| 0:24:58| There's need for both programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=1498)|
| 0:24:59| There's more need than we can even fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=1499)|
| 0:25:01| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=1501)|

| 0:26:19| which you presented some time ago and we adopted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=1579)|

| 0:27:42| Oh, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=1662)|
| 0:27:43| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=1663)|
| 0:27:44| Councilman Della Vopi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=1664)|
| 0:27:44| Yeah, I might ask the chief just to update us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=1664)|
| 0:27:47| because a lot of stuff going on out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=1667)|
| 0:27:50| You're doing work at the training center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=1670)|
| 0:27:52| You're doing work with K-9.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=1672)|
| 0:27:53| Just tell us, and of course, we're leaving| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=1673)|
| 0:27:55| the Moses Center for our training center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=1675)|
| 0:27:57| So just give us a little update on what's going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=1677)|
| 0:28:00| Sure, thank you, Councilman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=1680)|
| 0:28:02| So the K-9 facility will be a state-of-the-art facility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=1682)|
| 0:28:07| that we'll have right across from our headquarters| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=1687)|
| 0:28:10| that will give us the opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=1690)|
| 0:28:11| We have quite a large K-9 contingent now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=1691)|
| 0:28:15| as compared to when that building that we currently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=1695)|
| 0:28:18| reside in was built back in the 80s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=1698)|
| 0:28:20| And so we went from about five dogs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=1700)|
| 0:28:23| to now we have close to 17.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=1703)|
| 0:28:25| So our K-9 core has grown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=1705)|
| 0:28:29| And so this will give us a great opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=1709)|
| 0:28:31| to enhance that and provide proper housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=1711)|
| 0:28:35| for those officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=1715)|
| 0:28:38| And as far as the training facility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=1718)|
| 0:28:41| we just got word that, I guess, the contract| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=1721)|
| 0:28:46| on that building may be done soon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=1726)|
| 0:28:48| And so we are currently in the process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=1728)|
| 0:28:52| of making an offer for some property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=1732)|
| 0:28:54| in order to build our new training academy administration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=1734)|
| 0:28:57| building out at the Philly Keith location| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=1737)|
| 0:29:01| that we have now out in Cement Plant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=1741)|
| 0:29:05| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=1745)|
| 0:29:06| So we'll have that facility out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=1746)|
| 0:29:08| So there's a lot going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=1748)|
| 0:29:10| You are correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=1750)|
| 0:29:11| Is it going to be a gap between leaving Moses Center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=1751)|
| 0:29:14| and getting it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=1754)|
| 0:29:15| There will be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=1755)|
| 0:29:16| And what we're doing is we're going to temporarily create| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=1756)|
| 0:29:20| some space, office space, is all we'll| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=1760)|
| 0:29:22| need right now out at the current facility out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=1762)|
| 0:29:26| at Philly Keith Range.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=1766)|
| 0:29:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=1768)|
| 0:29:30| Councilman Grave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=1770)|
| 0:29:32| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=1772)|
| 0:29:32| I think it's important to note that Legacy Parks really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=1772)|
| 0:29:35| acted as the agent for the Wood family| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=1775)|
| 0:29:37| who really donated the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=1777)|
| 0:29:39| And you might want to say something about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=1779)|
| 0:29:42| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=1782)|
| 0:29:44| The family of Atwood have been very generous in donating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=1784)|
| 0:29:50| property, family property, to Legacy Parks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=1790)|
| 0:29:54| Of course, we all know the property that I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=1794)|
| 0:29:56| some 100 acres that they donated to Legacy Parks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=1796)|
| 0:30:00| at the end of James White Parkway, basically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=1800)|
| 0:30:04| And that'll be, we envision this as a entrance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=1804)|
| 0:30:09| to the urban wilderness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=1809)|
| 0:30:11| And they've got a lot of interesting bike park| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=1811)|
| 0:30:14| and facilities that are planned for that area that'll| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=1814)|
| 0:30:19| tie in with the TDOT land that leads to that property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=1819)|
| 0:30:23| So it's just a fabulous donation that they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=1823)|
| 0:30:27| have made towards the urban wilderness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=1827)|
| 0:30:29| And then likewise, they own property right here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=1829)|
| 0:30:33| across from the public safety building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=1833)|
| 0:30:36| And they have also donated that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=1836)|
| 0:30:38| So thank you for recognizing them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=1838)|
| 0:30:40| It is the family of Pat Wood who have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=1840)|
| 0:30:43| made these decisions to honor him| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=1843)|
| 0:30:46| by donating this property to be used| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=1846)|
| 0:30:48| in such a wonderful public way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=1848)|
| 0:30:56| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=1856)|
| 0:30:57| All in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=1857)|
| 0:30:58| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=1858)|
| 0:30:59| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=1859)|
| 0:31:00| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=1860)|
| 0:31:00| And so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=1860)|
| 0:31:01| 11M is a resolution authorizing the mayor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=1861)|
| 0:31:03| to enter into an agreement with First Place Finish| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=1863)|
| 0:31:06| Inc for the repair, replacement, and installation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=1866)|
| 0:31:08| of a new rubber safety surface, installation of two new playground| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=1868)|
| 0:31:11| elements, and two new concrete perimeter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=1871)|
| 0:31:14| borders for the Tyson Park playground for an amount| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=1874)|
| 0:31:16| not to exceed $154,632.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=1876)|
| 0:31:21| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=1881)|
| 0:31:21| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=1881)|
| 0:31:23| We have a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=1883)|
| 0:31:24| Councilman Delamope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=1884)|
| 0:31:25| I don't know if Joe's here or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=1885)|
| 0:31:27| Well, Joe, since you're sitting there, you might as well roll on up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=1887)|
| 0:31:31| I happen to have had a brief experience| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=1891)|
| 0:31:33| with this rubberized safety surface with the county working| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=1893)|
| 0:31:38| on Tank Strickland Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=1898)|
| 0:31:40| It took my breath away how expensive it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=1900)|
| 0:31:42| But I gather in this day and age, people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=1902)|
| 0:31:45| are concerned about being sued as well as providing safety for the kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=1905)|
| 0:31:50| But I remember times when we were bouncing off the asphalt or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=1910)|
| 0:31:55| And that was good enough for us in the old days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=1915)|
| 0:31:57| But kids are softer today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=1917)|
| 0:31:59| So tell us a little bit about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=1919)|
| 0:32:01| I will refrain from commenting on the impact of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=1921)|
| 0:32:04| The soft behinds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=1924)|
| 0:32:05| Well, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=1925)|
| 0:32:06| They get talkative and noisy at council meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=1926)|
| 0:32:09| But go ahead, Joe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=1929)|
| 0:32:10| Joe Wallace, Parks and Recreation Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=1930)|
| 0:32:12| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=1932)|
| 0:32:13| Yes, we've hired first place finish to finish up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=1933)|
| 0:32:18| Really, back in 1997, we built this new playground| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=1938)|
| 0:32:21| at Tyson Park, which at the time was our largest playground| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=1941)|
| 0:32:23| in the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=1943)|
| 0:32:25| And at the time, we could only afford to put the rubberized surface,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=1945)|
| 0:32:28| the poured in place surface, on about 2 thirds of that playground.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=1948)|
| 0:32:31| And the rest of it was pea gravel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=1951)|
| 0:32:33| Well, if you're familiar with Tyson Park, it floods a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=1953)|
| 0:32:36| Over the course of the last 15 years, we've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=1956)|
| 0:32:38| probably lost a couple hundred tons of pea gravel into the creek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=1958)|
| 0:32:42| So we've been saving our resources until now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=1962)|
| 0:32:46| to be able to afford to remove the pea gravel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=1966)|
| 0:32:48| and put more of that poured in place surface| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=1968)|
| 0:32:51| for the remainder of the playground.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=1971)|
| 0:32:52| And at the same time, we're putting in a couple more components| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=1972)|
| 0:32:55| to the playground, putting a concrete border| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=1975)|
| 0:32:57| all around the entire playground.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=1977)|
| 0:32:58| Currently, it's got a plastic border, which is pretty much worn out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=1978)|
| 0:33:02| And at the same time, we're also putting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=1982)|
| 0:33:04| a top layer of this poured in place surfacing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=1984)|
| 0:33:08| to top off the old surfacing to give it all a new look.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=1988)|
| 0:33:11| So it's a project that should get started in a couple of weeks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=1991)|
| 0:33:14| and should take about 60 days to complete.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=1994)|
| 0:33:16| And we're pretty excited about that, as is our public service department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=1996)|
| 0:33:19| because they're out there every time we have a flood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=1999)|
| 0:33:21| having to go in there with the bobcats, having to fix it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=2001)|
| 0:33:23| So you avoid a lot of maintenance, you're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=2003)|
| 0:33:25| saying, by having something that stays in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=2005)|
| 0:33:27| Well, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=2007)|
| 0:33:28| But you're right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=2008)|
| 0:33:29| You mentioned the point about the cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=2009)|
| 0:33:31| It is very expensive for the poured in place surfacing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=2011)|
| 0:33:33| But the advantage is, it lasts a long time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=2013)|
| 0:33:36| and it is totally accessible for children of all ages and all abilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=2016)|
| 0:33:43| And for folks that might not know in the audience,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=2023)|
| 0:33:45| this is some kind of ground rubber that's held together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=2025)|
| 0:33:48| by a composite goo of some sort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=2028)|
| 0:33:51| I'm not sure what it is, but.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=2031)|
| 0:33:52| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=2032)|
| 0:33:53| It's poured as a liquid, and it hardens and becomes a hard rubber surface.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=2033)|
| 0:33:59| And then they top that with a coating that's of various colors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=2039)|
| 0:34:02| to give it an attractive look.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=2042)|
| 0:34:04| So when the kids hit the ground, they'll bounce up on their feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=2044)|
| 0:34:07| We hope so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=2047)|
| 0:34:08| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=2048)|
| 0:34:08| No more scabs on these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=2048)|
| 0:34:10| I can't guarantee that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=2050)|
| 0:34:13| OK, thank you, Joe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=2053)|
| 0:34:15| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=2055)|

| 0:36:07| what could go there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=2167)|
| 0:36:09| Working with some of our council members, Councilman Gray| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=2169)|
| 0:36:11| taking lead on this, we determined it's a good idea| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=2171)|
| 0:36:14| to ask the Urban Land Institute to come back to Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=2174)|
| 0:36:17| and to look at four sites.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=2177)|
| 0:36:19| It would be the State Supreme Court site and the old McClellan Warehouse| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=2179)|
| 0:36:23| site, both of these are publicly owned sites that we will be moving| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=2183)|
| 0:36:27| into private development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=2187)|
| 0:36:28| And then there's the two other sites, World's Fair Park| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=2188)|
| 0:36:31| on the west side of town and the Civic Coliseum and Auditorium| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=2191)|
| 0:36:34| on the east side of town that are public entities that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=2194)|
| 0:36:36| are very important in our downtown area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=2196)|
| 0:36:38| We want to try to make sure we sharpen our focus on how to continue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=2198)|
| 0:36:41| to work and use those areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=2201)|
| 0:36:42| So we're very excited about them coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=2202)|
| 0:36:44| They will be here October the 5th will be the date Sunday they come to town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=2204)|
| 0:36:49| And on that Friday, October 10th, they'll give us a report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=2209)|
| 0:36:52| That's one thing we liked about this, it's a very quick turnaround| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=2212)|
| 0:36:55| to be here, it's intensive work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=2215)|
| 0:36:57| We'll have eight to ten professionals from around the country| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=2217)|
| 0:36:59| come and give us their, they will listen, learn, and then give us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=2219)|
| 0:37:04| their opinion on where they think we ought to head.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=2224)|
| 0:37:05| So we're very excited about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=2225)|
| 0:37:07| And this is the same group that did some groundwork a decade ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=2227)|
| 0:37:10| Will we have some of the same people or is it, have they moved on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=2230)|
| 0:37:13| Probably won't have the same people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=2233)|
| 0:37:14| We're with the same organization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=2234)|
| 0:37:16| Who will come has yet to be totally determined.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=2236)|
| 0:37:19| This is a group that came to town and recommended that the convention| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=2239)|
| 0:37:21| center move from the South Lawn and move to the Henley Street side| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=2241)|
| 0:37:25| of the World's Fair Park, which was a very good urban design move.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=2245)|
| 0:37:30| And they also made a comment in that time, don't go looking for silver bullets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=2250)|
| 0:37:34| Work with what you have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=2254)|
| 0:37:35| Develop what you have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=2255)|
| 0:37:36| And that's kind of the strategy we've worked on for the last 15 years here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=2256)|
| 0:37:39| And it worked very well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=2259)|
| 0:37:41| You going to have any program to invite, I don't know, groups of architects| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=2261)|
| 0:37:44| or builders and folks to meet with them during that week?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=2264)|
| 0:37:47| General schedule will be, there will be, they come to town Sunday night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=2267)|
| 0:37:51| There's a dinner there with the sponsors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=2271)|
| 0:37:52| We are the sponsors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=2272)|
| 0:37:53| When you hear the sponsors, it's the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=2273)|
| 0:37:56| There is a, and then Monday morning they will,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=2276)|
| 0:38:00| we will do a presentation of staff to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=2280)|
| 0:38:02| It's Monday afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=2282)|
| 0:38:03| They will tour the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=2283)|
| 0:38:04| There will be a reception that afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=2284)|
| 0:38:06| And then all day Tuesday they will meet with people to ask questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=2286)|
| 0:38:09| get their insights and opinions on where we are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=2289)|
| 0:38:11| and what should be happening on these properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=2291)|
| 0:38:14| They kind of pull away for a couple of days after that to do their work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=2294)|
| 0:38:17| and then come out Friday morning with the results.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=2297)|
| 0:38:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=2299)|
| 0:38:21| Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=2301)|
| 0:38:22| Yeah, thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=2302)|
| 0:38:23| Again, I think this is, if the chamber was the number one most important issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=2303)|
| 0:38:28| this is, to me, this is really, really important| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=2308)|
| 0:38:30| that we spend the time to get this right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=2310)|
| 0:38:32| And I applaud you, Mayor, for putting, setting aside the money to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=2312)|
| 0:38:35| And Bob and your guys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=2315)|
| 0:38:36| Thank you for supporting that and the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=2316)|
| 0:38:38| Well, I'm definitely really very supportive of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=2318)|
| 0:38:41| This is really important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=2321)|
| 0:38:42| And when we, and what started it, my, we looked at, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=2322)|
| 0:38:47| a request came to us about the Coliseum a couple of years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=2327)|
| 0:38:50| And those were big dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=2330)|
| 0:38:52| I said, you know, I don't mind spending the money if we've got a plan for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=2332)|
| 0:38:55| And this, I appreciate you putting the Coliseum in there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=2335)|
| 0:38:58| and looking at the State Supreme Court site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=2338)|
| 0:38:59| These are all very unique.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=2339)|
| 0:39:01| There'll be different uses on all those and different,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=2341)|
| 0:39:03| and certainly a lot of different opinions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=2343)|
| 0:39:05| So it doesn't mean that we take it carte blanche from what they say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=2345)|
| 0:39:09| We think we've got to put our, we know Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=2349)|
| 0:39:11| and a lot of people here know Knoxville better,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=2351)|
| 0:39:13| but it's certainly getting outside insight and outside wisdom| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=2353)|
| 0:39:18| paired with what we know and what we already know about our city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=2358)|
| 0:39:21| I think is really, really important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=2361)|
| 0:39:23| So again, kudos for doing this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=2363)|
| 0:39:26| And I look forward to, you know, participating as much as we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=2366)|
| 0:39:30| That's a good final point you made on that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=2370)|
| 0:39:32| Councilman Grave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=2372)|
| 0:39:33| Well, I think Bob has summed it up pretty well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=2373)|
| 0:39:35| And I'm especially excited about the possibilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=2375)|
| 0:39:39| And George, it's really true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=2379)|
| 0:39:41| We have a lot of wonderful experts here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=2381)|
| 0:39:43| and we've done an awful lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=2383)|
| 0:39:44| But we're going to have the opportunity of having some outside eyes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=2384)|
| 0:39:47| that are really professionals from around the country come and join us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=2387)|
| 0:39:51| And the thing that I want to encourage all the council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=2391)|
| 0:39:55| is to participate in this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=2395)|
| 0:39:56| because there will be an opportunity for not only the mayor's staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=2396)|
| 0:39:59| but for all of us and people who are involved in development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=2399)|
| 0:40:03| in downtown, in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=2403)|
| 0:40:04| So we're all going to have an opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=2404)|
| 0:40:06| It's going to be a pretty intense week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=2406)|
| 0:40:08| And so I encourage all of you to participate in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=2408)|
| 0:40:12| It's going to be pretty exciting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=2412)|
| 0:40:13| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=2413)|
| 0:40:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=2414)|
| 0:40:15| Okay, we have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=2415)|
| 0:40:17| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=2417)|
| 0:40:18| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=2418)|
| 0:40:19| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=2419)|
| 0:40:19| The ayes have it and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=2419)|
| 0:40:21| 11R is a resolution of council authorizing the mayor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=2421)|
| 0:40:24| to execute any and all documents necessary to apply for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=2424)|
| 0:40:27| and if awarded, accept a grant from the Environmental Protection Agency| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=2427)|
| 0:40:30| to provide funding for the city in the total amount of $1 million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=2430)|
| 0:40:33| to be used to implement a revolving loan fund| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=2433)|
| 0:40:36| for cleanup of local brownfield sites| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=2436)|
| 0:40:38| with a city match of $200,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=2438)|
| 0:40:41| Move for approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=2441)|
| 0:40:42| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=2442)|
| 0:40:43| We have a motion by Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=2443)|
| 0:40:45| Well, again, thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=2445)|
| 0:40:47| This is big long term and we haven't won it yet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=2447)|
| 0:40:50| but I think when you get in line for it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=2450)|
| 0:40:53| to clean up brownfield sites and turn around Fulton Bottom properties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=2453)|
| 0:40:57| like we have with University Commons, this is huge for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=2457)|
| 0:41:00| And we've got a number of sites around that we could use this money on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=2460)|
| 0:41:03| that will further development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=2463)|
| 0:41:05| So, you know, this is big.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=2465)|
| 0:41:10| We need to be all on our best behavior to try to win this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=2470)|
| 0:41:15| Whatever we can do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=2475)|
| 0:41:16| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=2476)|
| 0:41:17| Councilman Grave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=2477)|
| 0:41:18| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=2478)|
| 0:41:19| George, I just want to reiterate what you said also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=2479)|
| 0:41:21| The fact that several of us had the opportunity to tour| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=2481)|
| 0:41:25| University Commons on Friday along with the mayor and the administration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=2485)|
| 0:41:29| and I hope that all of you will take advantage of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=2489)|
| 0:41:32| get in touch with the developers and be able to go down there and take a look.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=2492)|
| 0:41:36| Absolutely amazing with what's down there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=2496)|
| 0:41:38| It's first class.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=2498)|
| 0:41:40| It's taken an old brownfield site and it's really turned it around| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=2500)|
| 0:41:43| and it's going to really have some good looks when it's all said and done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=2503)|
| 0:41:47| and also economically very sound.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=2507)|
| 0:41:49| Is that in your district?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=2509)|
| 0:41:50| You're going to want to go spend your money there, really.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=2510)|
| 0:41:52| You're going to want to spend, spend, spend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=2512)|
| 0:41:54| What did you say, George?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=2514)|
| 0:41:55| Is that in your district?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=2515)|
| 0:41:56| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=2516)|
| 0:41:57| Not even close to his district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=2517)|
| 0:41:59| I just didn't know why he was speaking towards you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=2519)|
| 0:42:02| Well, because I want to share in the glory there, right, Councilman Pavlis?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=2522)|
| 0:42:06| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=2526)|
| 0:42:07| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=2527)|
| 0:42:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=2530)|
| 0:42:11| We could have an annexation motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=2531)|
| 0:42:13| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=2533)|
| 0:42:15| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=2535)|
| 0:42:16| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=2536)|
| 0:42:17| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=2537)|
| 0:42:18| The ayes have it and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=2538)|
| 0:42:19| 11S is resolution authorizing the Industrial Development Board of the City of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=2539)|
| 0:42:23| to negotiate an except from Knoxville assemblage LLC payment in lieu of ad valorem taxes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=2543)|
| 0:42:28| with respect to property located at 712 18th Street, 1736, 30, 22,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=2548)|
| 0:42:33| and 1712 White Avenue and 701 and 711 17th Street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=2553)|
| 0:42:38| and finding that such payments are deemed to be in furtherance of the public purposes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=2558)|
| 0:42:42| of the board as defined in Tennessee Code Annotated 753 305.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=2562)|
| 0:42:47| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=2567)|
| 0:42:48| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=2568)|
| 0:42:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=2569)|
| 0:42:50| We have a motion and now we have, and I'll call on the law director,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=2570)|
| 0:42:53| there's an amendment that needs to be made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=2573)|
| 0:42:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=2575)|
| 0:42:57| Yeah, there was a sentence in Section 1, Subdivision 1 of Section 1| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=2577)|
| 0:43:03| that just inadvertently got out that really needs to be there by virtue of the state statute| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=2583)|
| 0:43:07| relative to the IDB that needs to be there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=2587)|
| 0:43:10| and that sentence would read and would come at the very end of that first subdivision there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=2590)|
| 0:43:16| the City Council hereby designates that the project is located in a center city area of the City of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=2596)|
| 0:43:23| and as set forth in Tennessee Code Annotated Section 7-53-101, Sub 13, Sub B, Sub 1,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=2603)|
| 0:43:31| and TCA Section 7-53-302A4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=2611)|
| 0:43:38| So that sentence needs to be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=2618)|
| 0:43:41| Hold on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=2621)|
| 0:43:42| One more thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=2622)|
| 0:43:43| And then in Subsection 2 of that, right after the number 7 you see there in that first sentence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=2623)|
| 0:43:49| the word years was omitted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=2629)|
| 0:43:51| Just add the word years, seven years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=2631)|
| 0:43:55| I'll amend my motion to include that language.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=2635)|
| 0:43:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=2638)|
| 0:43:59| So is there a second to the amendment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=2639)|
| 0:44:00| We actually read that in, you know, just inadvertently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=2640)|
| 0:44:03| Can you repeat the year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=2643)|
| 0:44:05| The subsection?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=2645)|
| 0:44:06| Yes, I can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=2646)|
| 0:44:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=2648)|
| 0:44:09| So we have a motion and a second on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=2649)|
| 0:44:10| Before we vote, Councilman Della Vopi?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=2650)|
| 0:44:12| Well, I don't have a comment on the amendment that's technically trying to get this right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=2652)|
| 0:44:16| but I do have a comment on the main item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=2656)|
| 0:44:17| Can I speak now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=2657)|
| 0:44:19| Just go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=2659)|
| 0:44:20| We'll just have a discussion then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=2660)|
| 0:44:21| I've got Bob Wetzel here, and I know everyone's been singing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=2661)|
| 0:44:24| hooray, development, hooray, on a number of items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=2664)|
| 0:44:28| Bob, I'm kind of stingy, and tell me again why we're giving a TIF| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=2668)|
| 0:44:33| in this relatively healthy economic area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=2673)|
| 0:44:36| I know we are working on Cumberland Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=2676)|
| 0:44:39| I know we want more bodies walking around, purchasing and, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=2679)|
| 0:44:46| dealing with the stores and making things work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=2686)|
| 0:44:48| but that's an area that has a certain amount of commercial value.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=2688)|
| 0:44:52| I had the pleasure of meeting the developer here just about an hour ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=2692)|
| 0:44:56| right after the beer board meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=2696)|
| 0:44:58| But tell us a little bit about this and why we're using a TIF to make it work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=2698)|
| 0:45:02| It is a pilot, not a TIF.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=2702)|
| 0:45:04| Excuse me, a pilot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=2704)|
| 0:45:05| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=2705)|
| 0:45:06| That's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=2706)|
| 0:45:07| I often do that myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=2707)|
| 0:45:08| I'm trying to get better at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=2708)|
| 0:45:10| The short answer to your question is we're doing a pilot because this project would not happen without it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=2710)|
| 0:45:15| I mean, that's the short answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=2715)|
| 0:45:17| While this is valuable real estate and a good market there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=2717)|
| 0:45:22| it's also very hard to assemble land in that area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=2722)|
| 0:45:25| and this is one of the biggest things this project has done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=2725)|
| 0:45:27| is it's assembled an entire half a block of land that's available for development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=2727)|
| 0:45:32| Plus, they are going to be moving to underground all the utilities in and around the site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=2732)|
| 0:45:37| which is a very expensive operation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=2737)|
| 0:45:39| I was told that was a big deal by the developer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=2739)|
| 0:45:41| That is a big deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=2741)|
| 0:45:42| Plus, and this is one we'll have to wrestle with in that area and in the downtown area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=2742)|
| 0:45:46| the structured parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=2746)|
| 0:45:48| It costs at least $15,000 a space for structured parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=2748)|
| 0:45:51| If we want intense development in our downtown and urban core,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=2751)|
| 0:45:55| we're going to have to make some tradeoffs to help us get that kind of structured parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=2755)|
| 0:45:59| So we think all of those things are important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=2759)|
| 0:46:01| That's one reason the finances are there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=2761)|
| 0:46:04| But the big goal is it supports the pedestrian and urban district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=2764)|
| 0:46:08| The pedestrian and urban district we're creating on Cumberland| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=2768)|
| 0:46:10| where you have people that can live there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=2770)|
| 0:46:13| They can either go to the University of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=2773)|
| 0:46:15| They can work at the hospitals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=2775)|
| 0:46:17| They can even work on the corridor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=2777)|
| 0:46:20| So it kind of adds to the density of population in there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=2780)|
| 0:46:22| toward the retail base on the Cumberland corridor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=2782)|
| 0:46:25| The developers are here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=2785)|
| 0:46:27| We've been working with them for over a year now on this particular project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=2787)|
| 0:46:32| and they'll be happy to speak if you have more questions here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=2792)|
| 0:46:37| I think that helps my understanding of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=2797)|
| 0:46:41| I'm wondering how this interfaces with the Cumberland Avenue project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=2801)|
| 0:46:45| It's such a congested workplace that you were even having trouble having bidders on round one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=2805)|
| 0:46:51| and I know that's not the only reason why that was raised.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=2811)|
| 0:46:54| But how does this interface with the ongoing activities that are going to happen on Cumberland Avenue?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=2814)|
| 0:46:59| Once again, the short answer is it's very complex.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=2819)|
| 0:47:01| That's one reason this has taken over a year to get it to this point in time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=2821)|
| 0:47:05| Between the utilities that we're putting in for our project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=2825)|
| 0:47:08| the utilities that are necessary for this project, for a project this big,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=2828)|
| 0:47:12| it's just going to be very complex.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=2832)|
| 0:47:15| The alley between this place right behind this lot will be closed for probably a couple of months,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=2835)|
| 0:47:21| but they've given us the right of way to use their property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=2841)|
| 0:47:24| during those couple of months to transport traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=2844)|
| 0:47:27| So we're working very closely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=2847)|
| 0:47:28| There will be a period when Cumberland's under construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=2848)|
| 0:47:31| This project's under construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=2851)|
| 0:47:33| Children's Hospital expansion is under construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=2853)|
| 0:47:36| It's going to get kind of wild and crazy there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=2856)|
| 0:47:38| but we're building for the future, and that's what we need to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=2858)|
| 0:47:40| There'll be a little pain in that process along the way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=2860)|
| 0:47:44| I probably know the answer to this because you tell me the same thing every time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=2864)|
| 0:47:48| but why can't we stair-step up the tax payables before the seventh year or the eighth year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=2868)|
| 0:47:54| And you're probably going to tell me because that's the money needed to pay off the loan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=2874)|
| 0:47:57| but go ahead and tell me why it is we can't increase the taxes after the building is open and in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=2877)|
| 0:48:04| Let me answer it this way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=2884)|
| 0:48:07| The benefit is a five-year benefit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=2887)|
| 0:48:09| While this is a seven-year TIF pilot you're approving tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=2889)|
| 0:48:12| the benefit's really just for five years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=2892)|
| 0:48:15| They'll take a two-year construction, so during that time period there's really no benefit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=2895)|
| 0:48:19| It's five years after completion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=2899)|
| 0:48:20| So it's five years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=2900)|
| 0:48:21| The first two we did in the Cumberland area were five-year pilots,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=2901)|
| 0:48:24| but they didn't close on those until about a year and a half after they were approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=2904)|
| 0:48:28| IDB has asked that we kind of change our policies, move them from approval to closure quickly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=2908)|
| 0:48:34| and then build in the two-year construction period or 18-month construction period into the pilot process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=2914)|
| 0:48:40| So clearly within a five-year period we do not feel like there's a need to do a step-up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=2920)|
| 0:48:45| The accounting is much more complicated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=2925)|
| 0:48:47| and once again this is what it kind of takes to close the gap to make this deal happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=2927)|
| 0:48:52| Would it be all right if the developer just gave us a nickel's worth of his view of this project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=2932)|
| 0:48:56| and how it's going forward?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=2936)|
| 0:48:57| I'm sure Jared would be happy to give you a view.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=2937)|
| 0:48:59| Jared, introduce yourself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=2939)|
| 0:49:02| Jared Shank.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=2942)|
| 0:49:03| Thank you all for having me here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=2943)|
| 0:49:07| My address is 1929 West Wellington, Chicago, Illinois.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=2947)|
| 0:49:12| This has been a labor of love.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=2952)|
| 0:49:13| I've worked on this with Bob for a year but really close to two years now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=2953)|
| 0:49:19| and to us it's an investment in your community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=2959)|
| 0:49:22| We really think it's a unique parcel right at the forefront of the 17th and Cumberland intersection,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=2962)|
| 0:49:29| and I think it's the right moment in time to anchor a lot of your vision of what you have for the Cumberland Avenue corridor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=2969)|
| 0:49:36| And so we've worked with the Knox Heritage, the Fort Sanders neighborhood in terms of design,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=2976)|
| 0:49:41| in terms of mix and presence to make sure that we honor the history of the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=2981)|
| 0:49:47| As we said, the investment in terms of putting parking underground| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=2987)|
| 0:49:50| and making sure we have enough parking to accommodate the permanent residents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=2990)|
| 0:49:55| It's just, I think, a very exciting project to get people to live downtown,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=2995)|
| 0:49:59| to walk to the medical center, to walk to the university, to be visiting professors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=2999)|
| 0:50:04| and to really experience the vibrancy of what your community is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=3004)|
| 0:50:07| And so that's the history and the energy we bring behind it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=3007)|
| 0:50:10| I think there's going to be 400 construction jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=3010)|
| 0:50:12| I think it will do great for the community during the construction period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=3012)|
| 0:50:15| The permanent residents will reinvigorate the retail in Cumberland.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=3015)|
| 0:50:19| And pulling all those utilities underground is an expensive proposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=3019)|
| 0:50:23| I think it will beautify the area also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=3023)|
| 0:50:25| So that's, in a nutshell, the vision of what we hope to achieve immediately and for a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=3025)|
| 0:50:32| Thank you for sharing that with us. Appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=3032)|
| 0:50:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=3035)|
| 0:50:36| Thank you. Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=3036)|
| 0:50:37| Yeah, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=3037)|
| 0:50:38| Bob, I'm going to go back to, we've done two recent pilots in the real close vicinity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=3038)|
| 0:50:45| and that was on the apartments on Cumberland Avenue and Hilton Garden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=3045)|
| 0:50:50| Hilton Garden Inn, that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=3050)|
| 0:50:51| And both of those were the five-year, but they didn't start until after they were finished.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=3051)|
| 0:50:57| Yeah, that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=3057)|
| 0:50:58| They didn't close on their pilot payment, close and transfer ownership| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=3058)|
| 0:51:03| to the Industrial Development Board until after the construction was complete.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=3063)|
| 0:51:07| And so that's why those were five-year periods, and now this will happen immediately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=3067)|
| 0:51:11| This will go to IDB in August, and they approve it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=3071)|
| 0:51:14| By the end of the year, they'll be closed out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=3074)|
| 0:51:16| and then they're hoping to have folks complete the building by late 2016.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=3076)|
| 0:51:21| So that's really when the pilot benefit will start.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=3081)|
| 0:51:24| Well, two competing projects pretty close together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=3084)|
| 0:51:27| I think it's important that the terms remain as equal as possible,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=3087)|
| 0:51:31| and I value the change of policy there, so I appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=3091)|
| 0:51:35| Just one more thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=3095)|
| 0:51:36| You've noticed on the downtown ones where the historic buildings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=3096)|
| 0:51:38| we've been going at 12 years instead of 10 years, so it's a continuation of that policy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=3098)|
| 0:51:43| getting two years on the front end for construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=3103)|
| 0:51:46| All right, thank you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=3106)|
| 0:51:47| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=3107)|
| 0:51:49| And this is on the, have we done the amendment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=3109)|
| 0:51:53| We did the amendment, or this is the amendment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=3113)|
| 0:51:55| Okay, so we're voting on the amendment, which is the new wording that has to be added.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=3115)|
| 0:52:00| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=3120)|
| 0:52:01| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=3121)|
| 0:52:02| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=3122)|
| 0:52:04| That passes, and now back to the original motion as amended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=3124)|
| 0:52:08| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=3128)|
| 0:52:10| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=3130)|
| 0:52:11| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=3131)|
| 0:52:12| Did I have a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=3132)|
| 0:52:14| Okay, we're fine on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=3134)|
| 0:52:15| Okay, good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=3135)|
| 0:52:17| All right, so it's all passed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=3137)|
| 0:52:20| Okay, let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=3140)|
| 0:52:22| We're now down to public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=3142)|
| 0:52:23| Is that right, Ms. Mitchell?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=3143)|
| 0:52:25| Okay, we have one person signed up for public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=3145)|
| 0:52:27| Vivian Scheip.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=3147)|
| 0:52:40| Nice to see you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=3160)|
| 0:52:42| Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=3162)|
| 0:52:43| Thank you for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=3163)|
| 0:52:44| You know, please state your name and address for the record, and I'll set the timer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=3164)|
| 0:52:49| Vivian Scheip, 119 South Gallagher View, apartment 120, Knoxville, 37919.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=3169)|
| 0:52:56| I say good evening to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=3176)|
| 0:52:58| I'm hearing good things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=3178)|
| 0:53:00| I'm hearing homelessness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=3180)|
| 0:53:01| I'm hearing money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=3181)|
| 0:53:04| I've been reading the paper a lot here lately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=3184)|
| 0:53:07| I've been keeping track.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=3187)|
| 0:53:08| I told you I was going to keep track, and I'll be back, and I'll keep coming back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=3188)|
| 0:53:13| So I've been noticing in the paper for the last couple of weeks three things that have happened that caught my attention,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=3193)|
| 0:53:20| which is why I'm here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=3200)|
| 0:53:22| I've noticed and I've written these checks for you guys, because these are the checks that you all have written.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=3202)|
| 0:53:27| First check, and this account is from the Walk Your Talk account for the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=3207)|
| 0:53:33| The first check is for $1.5 million to tear down Lakeshore, which is going on now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=3213)|
| 0:53:40| Cottages are coming down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=3220)|
| 0:53:42| They turned down the swimming pool, all the different buildings for the counseling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=3222)|
| 0:53:47| So they can put up what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=3227)|
| 0:53:49| Soccer fields, walkways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=3229)|
| 0:53:51| All kind of beautiful parkways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=3231)|
| 0:53:54| Second check, I saw on the news, saw you all digging a hole, throwing the dirt for the new retail areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=3234)|
| 0:54:01| More retail, more nice condos for people that have homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=3241)|
| 0:54:06| $1.2 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=3246)|
| 0:54:08| Third check says zero.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=3248)|
| 0:54:11| Paper says you all have not written the check nor committed the money for the safety center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=3251)|
| 0:54:16| You went to the task force.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=3256)|
| 0:54:18| We sat there for a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=3258)|
| 0:54:19| You said you're going to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=3259)|
| 0:54:20| Now something's wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=3260)|
| 0:54:22| Either the paper's wrong, and if they're wrong, I'm going to ask them to recant that story.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=3262)|
| 0:54:26| Or they're right and you all haven't written that check.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=3266)|
| 0:54:29| If you've written that check, how much was it for?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=3269)|
| 0:54:33| When did you give it to them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=3273)|
| 0:54:34| If you have not written the check, why haven't you done it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=3274)|
| 0:54:38| And when are you going to write it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=3278)|
| 0:54:40| You're committed to everything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=3280)|
| 0:54:42| Where's the money for the safety center?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=3282)|
| 0:54:44| I need an answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=3284)|
| 0:54:47| That's not the purpose of public forum, to have a back and forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=3287)|
| 0:54:50| You just state your opinion and counsel is glad to listen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=3290)|
| 0:54:55| Has the check been written for the safety center?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=3295)|
| 0:54:59| Again, just talk, give us what your opinion is, what you would like us to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=3299)|
| 0:55:04| and I'd be glad to talk to you afterwards about the safety center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=3304)|
| 0:55:07| I would like for you all to write that check for the safety center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=3307)|
| 0:55:11| When you did your homelessness plan, you got your claps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=3311)|
| 0:55:15| I even sent a letter to the paper commending you for coming to the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=3315)|
| 0:55:19| The county has got their money in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=3319)|
| 0:55:21| but every time the press goes away from this issue, you all don't step up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=3321)|
| 0:55:26| So what I want to know whether you answer it now or you answer it in the paper,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=3326)|
| 0:55:30| but you're going to answer where is this money and why you will not commit to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=3330)|
| 0:55:35| That is my comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=3335)|
| 0:55:37| Thank you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=3337)|
| 0:55:38| Thank you, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=3338)|
| 0:55:39| Okay, counsel, there is no other business, so this meeting is adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140722?start=3339)|
