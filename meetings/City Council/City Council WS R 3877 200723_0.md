| 0:00:37| My agenda here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=37)|
| 0:00:47| Okay, we'll start with the Pledge of Allegiance given by Councilmember Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=47)|

| 0:01:29| I believe Councilman Parker is finishing up a KTA meeting, so she may be a little late in joining.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=89)|

| 0:01:52| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=112)|
| 0:01:54| Councilman Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=114)|
| 0:01:56| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=116)|
| 0:01:59| Thank you, President, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=119)|
| 0:02:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=121)|
| 0:02:02| I'm going to go ahead and turn the call over to Mayor Kincannon for some opening remarks and then I'll have remarks before we get into our presentations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=122)|
| 0:02:12| Mayor Kincannon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=132)|
| 0:02:13| Okay, thank you so much, Vice Mayor, I want to start by thanking you for your leadership and organizing this workshop and the series of workshops.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=133)|
| 0:02:21| This is an important step as we all work together to explore and address issues that are vital to our community. In this case, reimagining what public safety can look like for Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=141)|
| 0:02:33| So as I think about a starting place for this conversation, two important themes stick out to me. First is that we do a lot of things well in KPD.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=153)|
| 0:02:43| We do a remarkable job. And I believe Knoxville is fortunate to have a collaborative and forward thinking law enforcement leadership team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=163)|
| 0:02:50| Second, is that it's clear and our officers are often the first to agree with this, that many of the challenges KPD is called on to address would be better suited for a social worker, a medic or a mental health professional, among others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=170)|
| 0:03:03| And my sense is that we're all at the table today knowing that social services are a critical part of our public safety model moving forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=183)|
| 0:03:11| The good news is that we have a long history of working closely with social service partners, in particular, KPD and Helen Ross McNabb.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=191)|
| 0:03:19| I work really closely together and I thank them for their leadership over the years. So we have a good foundation on which to build. And that foundation includes a common desire to do more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=199)|
| 0:03:30| Ideas abound, not only in our community, but also within KPD and the partners they've worked with over the years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=210)|
| 0:03:37| So we're already moving forward on implementing one idea, a true co-response team pilot, which that's going to be on Council's agenda next week and pending your approval, we can get that up and running by October.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=217)|
| 0:03:51| So we can talk more about that tonight as well. So again, thank you, Council. Thank you, Vice Mayor McKenzie for convening this meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=231)|
| 0:03:57| I'm looking forward to listening to the dialogue and talking about how we can continue to expand our partnerships that make public safety even stronger in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=237)|
| 0:04:07| Vice Mayor McKenzie, back to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=247)|
| 0:04:10| Thank you, Mayor. We certainly appreciate your support as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=250)|
| 0:04:14| So for those that are attending our call, this is the first in a series of workshops that City Council will be having in partnership with the Knoxville Police Department, led by Chief Eve Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=254)|
| 0:04:28| Today, we are going to be reviewing, have a review and analysis of incoming telephone calls, emergency and non-emergency, a breakdown of the categories.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=268)|
| 0:04:37| Then we'll have conversation around social work and crisis intervention team responses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=277)|
| 0:04:43| There are several other topics that City Council has determined are areas that we want to make sure that we're fully aware of, that we understand the policies and procedures, training curriculum, use of force policies, cultural competency training, and a few other topics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=283)|
| 0:05:01| And so therefore, we are glad that we have this partnership, that we're all working together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=301)|
| 0:05:07| So number one, we understand what policies and procedures are in place currently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=307)|
| 0:05:11| What does the data tell us to this point?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=311)|
| 0:05:15| And then have more discussion around maybe some potential opportunities or ways that we can be more efficient, more effective going forward in our collaboration with the Knoxville Area Police Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=315)|
| 0:05:27| And so I think we also have on the call with us the Park Executive Director, Ms. Stephanie Middlebrook.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=327)|
| 0:05:35| I think Ms. Middlebrook is coming with us today as a guest on the call as well, as she has responsibility as it relates to oversight from the Community Advisory Board as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=335)|
| 0:05:51| Her position is intricately involved in training curriculums and different changes when it comes to training and policy with the Knoxville Area Police Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=351)|
| 0:06:01| And so with that said, we're going to go ahead and turn the call over to Chief Thomas and her staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=361)|
| 0:06:07| And again, we thank you guys for your time today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=367)|
| 0:06:10| Council, throughout the presentation, if you have questions or comments, if you will, just make yourselves known.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=370)|
| 0:06:17| You may have to just call your name out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=377)|
| 0:06:20| Chief Thomas may not see everyone's hand up if you have questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=380)|
| 0:06:25| And then we will also have public forum at the end of the council workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=385)|
| 0:06:31| I do want to advise that it is not a requirement for council to have public forum in workshops.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=391)|
| 0:06:38| But we have decided to have public forum in this first initial workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=398)|
| 0:06:43| I will read the rules around public forum prior to us going into public forum today with the folks who have signed up to to speak to us today and give us their their comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=403)|
| 0:06:56| So with that said, Chief Thomas, if you would, we'll turn the call over to you now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=416)|
| 0:07:01| OK, I guess, Will, do you have the PowerPoint there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=421)|
| 0:07:05| I can't stand. I do, Chief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=425)|
| 0:07:08| Let me share that. OK, that'd be great. And this doesn't have a whole lot of information while he's putting that up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=428)|
| 0:07:15| This was created by folks at the city, Aaron Gill, the deputy mayor and some other folks and put it together for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=435)|
| 0:07:24| Just a few bullet points on this that we'll talk about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=444)|
| 0:07:27| But before we get started, I want to introduce everybody I have with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=447)|
| 0:07:32| To my left is Lieutenant Sammy Schaefer, who is our training director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=452)|
| 0:07:36| And he's going to talk about the first part of training was calls for service and go over that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=456)|
| 0:07:40| He also has served in the capacity of liaison to 9-1-1 and how we code calls for service and done a lot of training with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=460)|
| 0:07:48| Further to my left is Sergeant Rachel Brett, who's over our CIT program, which has garnered a lot of thought and a lot of talk and a lot of interest both within our department and outside the department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=468)|
| 0:08:04| And to help her, and you'll have to stick your head over here, is Officer Medina, who is also part of our CIT training program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=484)|
| 0:08:12| He's trying to hide, but I just wanted to let you know who all I have with me today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=492)|
| 0:08:16| I'm going to give a brief overview, just starting with about that third slide there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=496)|
| 0:08:26| Before I go to that really quick and I apologize, I'm digressing again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=506)|
| 0:08:29| But from what I understand in the past, when we've had new council members, what we've done is we've provided a little bit of training about how the police department works and what we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=509)|
| 0:08:38| And that has mostly contained training, our firearms training machine, our training simulator, traffic stops, things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=518)|
| 0:08:48| But there are a few other issues, especially here recently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=528)|
| 0:08:51| And so, council, you've asked for these specific things to be discussed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=531)|
| 0:08:56| And of course, if that changes after this meeting, we need to add or take away anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=536)|
| 0:09:00| We are more than happy if we need to add more meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=540)|
| 0:09:03| Because we want to make sure that you understand what we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=543)|
| 0:09:05| And we kind of kept these short.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=545)|
| 0:09:08| We're not going to give long presentations because we want a lot of interaction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=548)|
| 0:09:11| And if you have questions, that's what we need to know is what you don't understand and what we can explain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=551)|
| 0:09:15| So, you know, bear with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=555)|
| 0:09:18| And like I said, if you have questions at any time, please let us know. We'll stop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=558)|
| 0:09:21| But our presentations will be fairly short because we do want to make sure we answer all the questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=561)|
| 0:09:27| As you can see on this slide, our partnerships, one of the biggest partnerships we do have is with Helen Ross McNabb.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=567)|
| 0:09:33| They provide a lot of mental health services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=573)|
| 0:09:37| And especially since I can't remember what year, late 90s, when we closed Lakeshore and went to a different way of treating mental health or treatment in the field and use of families.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=577)|
| 0:09:50| We have had to lean on Helen Ross McNabb and things like mobile crisis and other entities that I'll go into in a little bit that we didn't just have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=590)|
| 0:10:00| We weren't able to get a medical e-mail and drop off Lakeshore because they had a mental issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=600)|
| 0:10:04| So we've had to do a lot more partnering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=604)|
| 0:10:07| You see Voluntary Ministry Center there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=607)|
| 0:10:11| They have worked with us in the Salvation Army on the foyer, which is a low barrier shelter for our homeless folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=611)|
| 0:10:19| And it's an important place because they don't require any kind of if somebody has substance abuse issues or issues that they really don't want to start a program with one of our other homeless providers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=619)|
| 0:10:31| It's just where they go and stay the night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=631)|
| 0:10:33| There's providers there for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=633)|
| 0:10:35| But it gives those people who are falling through the cracks and not having a place to lay their head at night, especially in the cold weather and maybe extremely hot weather.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=635)|
| 0:10:44| I used to sit on the Salvation Army board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=644)|
| 0:10:46| My deputy chief Ron Green does now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=646)|
| 0:10:49| So we have a good relationship with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=649)|
| 0:10:51| The Metropolitan Drug Coalition and then, of course, all for that knocks, which is our coalition to deal with the opioid epidemic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=651)|
| 0:10:59| And I sit on the board of the Metropolitan Drug Coalition, along with Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=659)|
| 0:11:04| Charles Swanson, who's our law director, is on there as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=664)|
| 0:11:07| Knox County schools we partner with a lot in a big way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=667)|
| 0:11:11| And what I understand is getting ready to do some CIT training over there with their folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=671)|
| 0:11:17| So that's important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=677)|
| 0:11:19| Of course, Chief Gus Peduces, who is now their school security chief, actually came from the police department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=679)|
| 0:11:25| So we do a lot of training with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=685)|
| 0:11:27| So we both are on the same page as to how we respond to different things, although we respond differently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=687)|
| 0:11:34| So we've got to understand how each other work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=694)|
| 0:11:37| So we do a lot of training with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=697)|
| 0:11:39| And I also sit on the disparity in educational outcomes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=699)|
| 0:11:43| I guess it's a board that they have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=703)|
| 0:11:46| How can we get kids who are falling through the cracks so everybody gets the same education?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=706)|
| 0:11:51| You see the University of Tennessee College of Social Work, or the SWARCs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=711)|
| 0:11:55| We work with them a lot on grants and how do we focus on outcomes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=715)|
| 0:12:00| And they do a lot with us there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=720)|
| 0:12:03| Of course, UT Medical Center and many, many others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=723)|
| 0:12:06| There's a lot of boards in the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=726)|
| 0:12:09| I sit on the Boys and Girls Club of Tennessee Valley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=729)|
| 0:12:12| When somebody asks us to have a place at the table, we will do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=732)|
| 0:12:16| And we try to get somebody of rank in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=736)|
| 0:12:19| So if there's somebody who needs our help or if there's something that we can contribute or that we can see as a resource,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=739)|
| 0:12:26| when we're out in the field answering calls, that benefits all of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=746)|
| 0:12:31| That next slide, when we talk specifically about Helen Ross McNabb and the things that we have worked on with them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=751)|
| 0:12:38| you'll see the Crisis Stabilization Unit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=758)|
| 0:12:41| It's kind of like the precursor, it's still there, to the VHUG.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=761)|
| 0:12:46| So we would take people there who had issues with mental illness instead of trying to put them in the criminal justice system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=766)|
| 0:12:57| In 2009, the Women's Program, and that was an early co-response partnership,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=777)|
| 0:13:02| and it dealt a lot with prostitution issues and how can we get women out of that cycle of prostitution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=782)|
| 0:13:08| and getting some intervention there with mental health.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=788)|
| 0:13:12| Of course, and I'm not sure, is 2012 when we started Crisis Intervention Training?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=792)|
| 0:13:17| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=797)|
| 0:13:18| Oh, wow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=798)|
| 0:13:19| We started earlier than I thought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=799)|
| 0:13:20| So that's when Crisis Intervention Training actually started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=800)|
| 0:13:23| And you'll see at the same time Mobile Crisis Unit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=803)|
| 0:13:27| We had Mobile Crisis Unit even back in the mid-early 90s when I started, and it kind of got retooled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=807)|
| 0:13:33| It's a 24-hour response, although it's not as effective and not always as prompt of a response as we like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=813)|
| 0:13:40| A lot of times they will meet us if we need the Mobile Crisis Unit at the hospital rather than out in the field.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=820)|
| 0:13:46| They used to come out in the field any hour of the day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=826)|
| 0:13:50| Now they don't do that any longer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=830)|
| 0:13:53| Early diversion programs, of course, those are the things that we want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=833)|
| 0:13:56| We want to divert people who have mental health issues or other type issues out of the criminal justice system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=836)|
| 0:14:02| That way we don't have to see them again and again if we can address the issues that they may have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=842)|
| 0:14:06| So in the long run, it benefits everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=846)|
| 0:14:08| It benefits the person and the criminal justice system so we're not going and answering the same call with the same person again and again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=848)|
| 0:14:15| In 2013, you see the Family Justice Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=855)|
| 0:14:19| That is a huge, huge thing for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=859)|
| 0:14:22| We were the first one, I believe, in the southeast of Chief Keefe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=862)|
| 0:14:26| Had a lot of influence in getting that going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=866)|
| 0:14:30| And that started before 2013.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=870)|
| 0:14:34| But the Family Justice Center, what it does is for domestic violence issues, all the partners are there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=874)|
| 0:14:43| People can go there and they can get a warrant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=883)|
| 0:14:46| They can get counseling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=886)|
| 0:14:50| They can, we have, we have a lot of partners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=890)|
| 0:14:58| We have shelters available there for women's shelters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=898)|
| 0:15:02| Bettered Women Unit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=902)|
| 0:15:04| We have partnerships.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=904)|
| 0:15:06| At one time, I think there were about 26 partners in that building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=906)|
| 0:15:09| It has filtered out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=909)|
| 0:15:10| The partners are still there and available but not always in the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=910)|
| 0:15:15| But we can go to that, we can bring a person who is a victim of domestic violence to that building and they get all the assistance they need, whether it be an order of protection, a place to stay, help with a case, but they get it right there in that building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=915)|
| 0:15:27| Again, the city picked up after a federal grant ended on early diversion programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=927)|
| 0:15:34| And then in 2018, the Behavioral Health Urgent Care Center, what we call the BHUC, opened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=934)|
| 0:15:41| And I think folks at Helen Rossman may have had a meeting with them and they call it the BUC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=941)|
| 0:15:45| And I was like, what's the BUC?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=945)|
| 0:15:47| So if you hear BHUC or BUC, that's the same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=947)|
| 0:15:51| And again, that's treatment in lieu of incarceration right there on the scene.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=951)|
| 0:15:56| So we track seven different calls, minor offenses like disorderly conduct or maybe public intoxication.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=956)|
| 0:16:04| And if the person that we are planning to arrest for that offense or site is not violent, and we offer them, and we track those every arrest or site we give.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=964)|
| 0:16:16| We track those every week and see if they were offered the BHUC and if they did not go, why not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=976)|
| 0:16:22| We read those narratives or those reports.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=982)|
| 0:16:25| What it does is it keeps people, they get to go to the BHUC for treatment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=985)|
| 0:16:29| And when they complete that program, they do not have a charge on their record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=989)|
| 0:16:36| So it keeps them completely out of the criminal justice system for that one charge, which is a huge, it can be a game changer for some people not to have a criminal record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=996)|
| 0:16:46| All right, so one of the things that's going to come before you all on Tuesday night is our co-response team with Helen Ross McNabb on the next slide there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=1006)|
| 0:16:58| This is something that's been in the works probably close to two years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=1018)|
| 0:17:01| I think we were talking about it even before I became chief, trying to get this, make this work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=1021)|
| 0:17:06| And it's kind of based on the program we did with Helen Ross McNabb, where we tried to get our women's program going with the prostitutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=1026)|
| 0:17:17| This we're looking at more is mental health, people who have mental health issues, and we're going to have a master's level behavioral health person paired with an officer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=1037)|
| 0:17:28| So they're actually in the same car together, responding to calls, and they will be able to respond to calls all over the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=1048)|
| 0:17:34| And so if a call comes out, or even if there's an officer on a call, and it could be a break in, it could be any kind of call that happens, and they think there's a mental health component, we'll have that car respond to that call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=1054)|
| 0:17:47| I'm not sure what the hours will be, we hope to mix those up. So we'll see what the availability of the staff with Helen Ross McNabb has, but we're hoping to not just be daytime.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=1067)|
| 0:17:59| We have a lot of evening and overnight issues, so we're hoping to be able to respond at different times of the day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=1079)|
| 0:18:05| And of course, those folks can't respond, we can always make a note and have a response later on the next day, if it's not something where they need immediate response.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=1085)|
| 0:18:16| So what we're hoping is, as we go through this program, to see how it works and refine it and find out what's working good, what's not working. And my gut feeling tells me that next year, a lot of federal grants will have to do with this co-response type response to mental health issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=1096)|
| 0:18:35| So I'm hoping that that will give us a leg up on applying for some federal money that might be available next year to be ahead of that game, and be able to really fine-tune what we want to do with that program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=1115)|
| 0:18:47| So again, you see this will be on, the contract will actually be on your agenda Tuesday night, July 28th, and we hope to launch that hopefully latest October 2020, because we are, like I said, we are ready to go. We really want to get that in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=1127)|
| 0:19:01| We think it will really help us with chronic problems, and it will help us respond better to those type of issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=1141)|
| 0:19:10| The next section, and again, I've moved through it pretty quick, but you know, actually to start the real training and the calls for service and understanding what our calls for service are and what they're about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=1150)|
| 0:19:21| And Lieutenant Schaefer is going to go into that. So we, because we're at the PowerPoint, we really can't see you. I don't know, maybe Vice Mayor, if you could let us know if there's a question at any point in this presentation, that would be great. We'd appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=1161)|
| 0:19:35| I'll turn it over to Lieutenant Schaefer right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=1175)|
| 0:19:41| Well, again, I appreciate you all having us, and it's a good opportunity for us to share this information, and I hope that as we talk about the way that our calls are received and the way that our calls are grouped and look at some numbers from last year, it helps to clarify some things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=1181)|
| 0:19:57| I think you all have the breakdown. Was Council provided the list of calls there? My plan is not to read through all those, but kind of hit some highlights of how these numbers come about as well as obviously answer your questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=1197)|
| 0:20:11| Do you all have that that you can follow along?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=1211)|
| 0:20:13| Yes, we do, but I have to switch presentations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=1213)|
| 0:20:17| You have to read back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=1217)|
| 0:20:20| So, Will, was this list sent to Council in advance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=1220)|
| 0:20:26| I had it in the last 30 or 40 minutes before the meeting began.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=1226)|
| 0:20:31| What I'll do, I'll forward it right now to all the Council members, and then, Will, you can send it out to anyone else who doesn't know what this is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=1231)|
| 0:20:39| Okay, thank you, Aaron. Thank you, Will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=1239)|
| 0:20:42| So, to follow along there, first of all, this data comes from the Knox County Emergency Communication District, or our 9-1-1 center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=1242)|
| 0:20:49| They track these calls for us. This is broke down by actual telephone calls or radio calls, which we'll see that these kind of overlap, but these are not anything that we're tracking in the way of reporting, if you would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=1249)|
| 0:21:03| So, I think it's important to understand that this comes from 9-1-1, and I appreciate their help in getting these calls and this information together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=1263)|
| 0:21:10| To kind of explain the numbers a little bit, let me kind of first walk through the process, and then the first couple of numbers that will make a little bit more sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=1270)|
| 0:21:18| So, 9-1-1 provides for not only the 9-1-1 call takers, but for our dispatchers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=1278)|
| 0:21:23| The police dispatchers don't work for the police department. They're actually Knox County Emergency Communication employees, and we work together on developing policy and procedure and protocol for how to handle calls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=1283)|
| 0:21:34| So, their organization actually takes the incoming 9-1-1 call. A call taker, when you call 9-1-1, will take the information and will determine how to code the call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=1294)|
| 0:21:43| So, as you're explaining the emergency, they're deciding what do we call this call in a coding order, and then which agency gets it, or multiple agencies may get the same call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=1303)|
| 0:21:55| So, as that information's coming in, they're what we call building a screen, which is then electronically sent over to the dispatchers for those respective agencies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=1315)|
| 0:22:03| Those dispatchers are then trained in who and how many of our resources do we send.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=1323)|
| 0:22:09| So, our police officer, our police dispatchers, they know on this type of call, send these type of units, and they're working with the patrol supervisors to manage that, and then each agency has its own, of course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=1329)|
| 0:22:21| So, sometimes an agency or one call may go to multiple agencies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=1341)|
| 0:22:25| So, to help explain that, we use the numbers to help explain that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=1345)|
| 0:22:29| So, if you look at the first number, total incoming phone calls to the 9-1-1 center last year were over 618,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=1349)|
| 0:22:36| Now, that's not just 9-1-1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=1356)|
| 0:22:38| That is the non-emergency number that a lot of people are familiar with, the 215-4010, which is a non-emergency line into 9-1-1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=1358)|
| 0:22:45| That includes calls directly into the dispatchers that we often utilize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=1365)|
| 0:22:50| That includes administrative calls to the 9-1-1 staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=1370)|
| 0:22:53| So, 618,000 total calls, but from that was generated 644,000 calls for all the emergency agencies and even some non-emergency agencies within Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=1373)|
| 0:23:04| So, how can you have more calls generated from fewer phone calls?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=1384)|
| 0:23:09| The easiest way to explain that would be like a car accident with injury.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=1389)|
| 0:23:14| If a call comes in of an accident with injury, say on Gay Street, that's actually generating three calls because the ambulance service is going to get that call,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=1394)|
| 0:23:23| the fire department is going to get that call, and the police department is going to get that call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=1403)|
| 0:23:27| So, one call may have resulted in the creation of three different screens because the agency is responding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=1407)|
| 0:23:33| So, that's why that's one of the first questions I get is how is that possible?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=1413)|
| 0:23:38| So, as soon as you break down of those calls created, not calls coming in anymore, let's leave that and talk about calls created for an agency to answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=1418)|
| 0:23:47| Of that 644, you can see the KPD makes up nearly half.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=1427)|
| 0:23:52| 301,000 calls were created for us last year, and then you see how the agencies break down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=1432)|
| 0:23:57| As you get down into the other agencies, oftentimes those are out-of-county agencies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=1437)|
| 0:24:02| They may actually receive a call that's meant for Blount, Loudoun, Anderson County, depending on which cell phone tower received that emergency call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=1442)|
| 0:24:10| So, it has to be transferred.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=1450)|
| 0:24:12| Our dispatchers will also create calls if 311 is closed, then they're going to create calls for the service department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=1452)|
| 0:24:18| So, there's another agency that may not be just our emergency agencies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=1458)|
| 0:24:24| So, then from there, we start breaking down. The rest of the chart goes through that 301,000 calls for last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=1464)|
| 0:24:31| So, as we go through those, I have to put out yet another disclaimer, the way that that call was coded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=1471)|
| 0:24:37| So, the information that maybe that call taker received, they're basing it on, they can't see the call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=1477)|
| 0:24:43| Oftentimes, the callers are stressed, they're panicked, they're getting broken information, and they create the call the best that they can to get a quick dispatch started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=1483)|
| 0:24:54| So, a call may be coded one thing, and by the time the officers or the firefighters or EMS arrives, we may learn it's something different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=1494)|
| 0:25:01| It is in upon us to change that, to let dispatch know, hey, dispatch, this was not a domestic dispute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=1501)|
| 0:25:07| This was a dispute between neighbors, which is a different coding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=1507)|
| 0:25:11| And honestly, if we don't take that step and fix that, it's left in its original code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=1511)|
| 0:25:16| So, you kind of have to take some of the numbers with a grain of salt that this is how the call was originated based on what we knew at the time, if we didn't change it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=1516)|
| 0:25:25| So, as we go down through there, I tried to group in and tried to put some things together just to make a two-page document as opposed to a multiple-page document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=1525)|
| 0:25:33| And I don't want to just rattle off every number, but some of the ones that obviously jump out at us, some of the bigger ones, you know, traffic problems,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=1533)|
| 0:25:43| that could be as simple as a car broke down on the side of the road that someone's called in about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=1543)|
| 0:25:48| That could also mean a car blocking traffic or a truck blocking traffic, anything of that sort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=1548)|
| 0:25:54| Officer initiated that 21,000, there's another big number that jumps at us, that's where an officer most commonly has done a traffic stop,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=1554)|
| 0:26:01| and they're calling that in themselves, or maybe they're getting out to investigate suspicious activity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=1561)|
| 0:26:06| but that is something that the officer generated themselves, that no one called 911 proactively on our side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=1566)|
| 0:26:14| When you get down to sick and injured persons, obviously if you were to pull these same numbers for the fire department or for EMS, they would be much larger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=1574)|
| 0:26:23| The reason that we have them on there is we will answer those sick and injured person calls if it's a child or if there's anything suspicious or unknown circumstances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=1583)|
| 0:26:33| So don't think that that's the only sick and injured calls that were in our city or county last year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=1593)|
| 0:26:38| that's just where the code even called for a law enforcement response, just to be on the safe side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=1598)|
| 0:26:43| Obviously one of the biggest numbers that jumps out is our 911 hang up calls,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=1603)|
| 0:26:47| that's almost a third of our overall call volume in the city, just shy of 100,000 911 calls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=1607)|
| 0:26:54| Those have to be tracked, because that was a request for service through the 911 system, so that call is created.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=1614)|
| 0:27:01| A lot of times those calls are cleared up by the call taker taking the action to call back and say is everything okay there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=1621)|
| 0:27:07| Sometimes that still warrants a response.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=1627)|
| 0:27:10| Let's say that someone called 911, they're in the middle of a domestic situation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=1630)|
| 0:27:14| or they're in the middle of a robbery, and they were able to make that call but they can't talk,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=1634)|
| 0:27:18| and some of those still require the response, but most of those are accidental hang ups or intentional hang ups, unfortunately at times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=1638)|
| 0:27:27| So if we scroll down through there, obviously accidents and things that have to do with traffic accidents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=1647)|
| 0:27:32| and anything to do with traffic always brings about high numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=1652)|
| 0:27:36| The property damage column there that you see, the 9300, most of those we don't answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=1656)|
| 0:27:42| The call takers give them the advice over the phone on how we take care of that now for private property accidents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=1662)|
| 0:27:48| unless it's a hit and run, drunk driver, some sort of dispute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=1668)|
| 0:27:53| Alarms, as we keep going down, again I don't want to read everyone unless you have a question about one specifically,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=1673)|
| 0:27:58| but alarms are big, over 12,000 if you combine home and business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=1678)|
| 0:28:03| Some of those are false alarms, many of those are false alarms,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=1683)|
| 0:28:06| but some of those may in fact result in a burglary that's discovered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=1686)|
| 0:28:11| If we go to the next page, we'll just keep going and let somebody see the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=1691)|
| 0:28:16| Other big ones that jump out at us as we go down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=1696)|
| 0:28:21| so there's animal control accounts for 10,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=1701)|
| 0:28:24| We have an animal control unit that does a good job of managing those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=1704)|
| 0:28:27| Occasionally officers will go with them if they need the help,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=1707)|
| 0:28:32| but usually our animal control unit is good to be self-sustaining.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=1712)|
| 0:28:35| Domestics, obviously 11,000, that number is usually hovering right about there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=1715)|
| 0:28:40| That doesn't always mean that violence has occurred.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=1720)|
| 0:28:42| That's important to remember, sometimes those are verbal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=1722)|
| 0:28:45| It doesn't mean that necessarily each one of those is violent related.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=1725)|
| 0:28:49| Disturbance would be back at 18,000 there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=1729)|
| 0:28:51| Disturbance would be back to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=1731)|
| 0:28:53| I talked about maybe not a domestic, but a neighborhood dispute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=1733)|
| 0:28:56| Suspicious persons is another large category.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=1736)|
| 0:28:59| Then when we get down to the bottom, a couple of numbers to point out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=1739)|
| 0:29:02| The Teleserve number there, the 5,000 or so Teleserve calls,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=1742)|
| 0:29:06| those are calls that maybe came through or that we gave to our Teleserve unit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=1746)|
| 0:29:11| to allow an officer to give advice over the phone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=1751)|
| 0:29:14| as opposed to actually sending someone out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=1754)|
| 0:29:16| Sometimes we do reports that way too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=1756)|
| 0:29:18| That's just if the call was coded that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=1758)|
| 0:29:20| We'll see later that more calls than that go into our Teleserve unit for sure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=1760)|
| 0:29:25| but as far as the coding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=1765)|
| 0:29:27| Then the testing column down there at the bottom,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=1767)|
| 0:29:30| 6,400 test screens or miscellaneous screens last year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=1770)|
| 0:29:33| you have to remember we were going through a lot of upgrades| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=1773)|
| 0:29:35| with our CAD system last year, and the only way that they can test| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=1775)|
| 0:29:38| some things is to build test screens and then close those out of the system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=1778)|
| 0:29:41| but they still count toward ours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=1781)|
| 0:29:45| We'll go on to disposition codes here in just a second| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=1785)|
| 0:29:48| of how all these calls were actually cleared, but before that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=1788)|
| 0:29:51| are there any questions about a category, a call,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=1791)|
| 0:29:54| or why a number might look like it does?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=1794)|
| 0:30:00| I've got some questions, but I'll save mine until we get finished going through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=1800)|
| 0:30:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=1806)|
| 0:30:10| Kim, can we switch to the disposition chart there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=1810)|
| 0:30:14| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=1814)|
| 0:30:16| When we clear a call, we tell the dispatcher,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=1816)|
| 0:30:19| we give them a code that tells them whenever they can close the call out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=1819)|
| 0:30:23| we can put it away, and the officer can be ready for the next call,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=1823)|
| 0:30:27| but we also are telling them what actions that we took.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=1827)|
| 0:30:31| This is a percentage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=1831)|
| 0:30:34| When I ran all the dispositions, again, I tried to group them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=1834)|
| 0:30:37| to get it all in one page document, tried to lump some things together,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=1837)|
| 0:30:40| and I rounded to the nearest half percent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=1840)|
| 0:30:43| and looked at all of the ways that we could clear a call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=1843)|
| 0:30:46| If you total these up, they will come up to over 100%,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=1846)|
| 0:30:50| so I have to explain that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=1850)|
| 0:30:52| Oftentimes, we are able to clear a call multiple ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=1852)|
| 0:30:56| So, for example, I can clear a call that I made a report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=1856)|
| 0:30:59| This call is over, and I cleared it by I'll be submitting a crime report,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=1859)|
| 0:31:03| but I also, let's say you take a traffic accident,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=1863)|
| 0:31:06| maybe I'm clearing the call that I make in an accident report,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=1866)|
| 0:31:09| but I also issued a citation in the course of that investigation of that wreck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=1869)|
| 0:31:14| So I will clear the call with a report and a citation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=1874)|
| 0:31:18| So when I pulled these numbers, I pulled things individually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=1878)|
| 0:31:22| So if you were to total up the way that we can clear calls,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=1882)|
| 0:31:24| it comes to over 100 because there's times that these calls| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=1884)|
| 0:31:27| have been cleared in multiple ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=1887)|
| 0:31:29| So you can see, going back to I told you the Teleserv number was low| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=1889)|
| 0:31:33| as far as the creation of the screen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=1893)|
| 0:31:35| our Teleserv unit takes a large chunk from this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=1895)|
| 0:31:38| One-third of the calls that we have to manage our Teleserv unit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=1898)|
| 0:31:41| has been able to help us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=1901)|
| 0:31:43| So, again, those officers on the telephone have been able to assist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=1903)|
| 0:31:47| The next biggest category is we've made a report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=1907)|
| 0:31:50| That could be a traffic accident report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=1910)|
| 0:31:52| That could be a crime report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=1912)|
| 0:31:54| We cleared the call by means of documentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=1914)|
| 0:31:57| We were able to resolve the problem without any action as that third category.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=1917)|
| 0:32:01| So the officers got there, they offered some advice,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=1921)|
| 0:32:03| they got everything settled down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=1923)|
| 0:32:05| and they were able to clear it with no arrests, no citation, no report made,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=1925)|
| 0:32:10| just able to get things resolved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=1930)|
| 0:32:12| And then we see, as we move down the column there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=1932)|
| 0:32:15| I've listed those in order of the way that we could clear them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=1935)|
| 0:32:18| So whether everything checked out okay, there was no police action taken,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=1938)|
| 0:32:22| maybe we got there and realized that this was a false call| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=1942)|
| 0:32:26| or there's nothing to it, that's in there for no action taken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=1946)|
| 0:32:29| A lot of times we cleared the call that we backed up another officer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=1949)|
| 0:32:32| and all we did was assist them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=1952)|
| 0:32:34| Sometimes the supervisors will cancel a call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=1954)|
| 0:32:37| So a call will come out and the supervisor says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=1957)|
| 0:32:39| that's not a police issue, that goes somewhere else,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=1959)|
| 0:32:41| and those calls are canceled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=1961)|
| 0:32:43| I know one thing of interest is the call involved a mental crisis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=1963)|
| 0:32:49| It only shows 1%, which number-wise was about 880.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=1969)|
| 0:32:54| That is a new code that we just introduced last year as a way of clearing a call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=1974)|
| 0:32:59| So it wasn't really in effect for the full year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=1979)|
| 0:33:02| and there's a little bit of a learning curve with our officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=1982)|
| 0:33:04| We put a new code on them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=1984)|
| 0:33:06| When they clear a call, they can actually let the dispatcher know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=1986)|
| 0:33:09| that this case involves some sort of mental crisis issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=1989)|
| 0:33:13| so that we can go back and track those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=1993)|
| 0:33:15| So that number is definitely low,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=1995)|
| 0:33:17| but it really didn't catch the full year last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=1997)|
| 0:33:21| And then the way that we grouped them, of course,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=2001)|
| 0:33:23| there could be a margin of error.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=2003)|
| 0:33:25| So that's what I have in the way of the call breakdown| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=2005)|
| 0:33:28| as well as the dispositions of how we cleared those calls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=2008)|
| 0:33:32| Like she said, I would rather spend time answering your questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=2012)|
| 0:33:40| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=2020)|
| 0:33:42| Will, I know that – and thank you for that overview.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=2022)|
| 0:33:45| Will, I know you've got a lot of things going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=2025)|
| 0:33:47| I know, Erin, you said that you were going to send us the breakdown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=2027)|
| 0:33:51| I want to look and see if I have that actually in my email| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=2031)|
| 0:33:55| because I did have a couple of questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=2035)|
| 0:33:58| We know if it didn't go through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=2038)|
| 0:33:59| I think I sent it to all of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=2039)|
| 0:34:07| Does anyone else want to start with questions while I'm pulling that up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=2047)|
| 0:34:11| I definitely need to reference that when I have my questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=2051)|
| 0:34:18| I have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=2058)|
| 0:34:20| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=2060)|
| 0:34:24| Earlier when you were talking about the phone calls,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=2064)|
| 0:34:26| you were saying the three calls made, ambulance, fire department, and police,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=2066)|
| 0:34:31| how is that decision made on who to call?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=2071)|
| 0:34:34| I'm assuming it's the dispatcher, but what criteria do they use?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=2074)|
| 0:34:39| So each call is different, and there's two sets of protocols that are utilized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=2079)|
| 0:34:44| So the call taker taking the call has one set of protocols that they follow,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=2084)|
| 0:34:49| and the computer is set up to do the majority of the work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=2089)|
| 0:34:52| So once they determine this is an accident with injury| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=2092)|
| 0:34:55| and they code that information in such a way the computer is programmed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=2095)|
| 0:34:59| each agency contributed to that program when it went in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=2099)|
| 0:35:02| that this type of call is going to get these agencies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=2102)|
| 0:35:05| So the agencies come together and say, okay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=2105)|
| 0:35:08| on a traffic accident with injury in the city, we want these resources to respond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=2108)|
| 0:35:12| So that call then goes to their respective agencies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=2112)|
| 0:35:16| Now then a new set of protocols will come into play.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=2116)|
| 0:35:19| So a call taker doesn't know which fire truck will go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=2119)|
| 0:35:24| They don't know which or how many police officers may go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=2124)|
| 0:35:28| They know how to build the call and send it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=2128)|
| 0:35:30| So now then the dispatcher's training and protocols come into play,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=2130)|
| 0:35:33| and they say, oh, that's a wreck with injury.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=2133)|
| 0:35:36| It gets at this location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=2136)|
| 0:35:38| The computer again assists them and says it gets this fire truck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=2138)|
| 0:35:42| Maybe there's a chance of entrapment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=2142)|
| 0:35:45| So the fire department and their system knows that it also gets a rescue truck| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=2145)|
| 0:35:49| if that resource is needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=2149)|
| 0:35:51| At the same time, our computer system reminds the dispatcher it's a domestic dispute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=2151)|
| 0:35:57| That gets two officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=2157)|
| 0:35:59| And based on the officers available and the location of that call,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=2159)|
| 0:36:02| here's who we recommend you send.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=2162)|
| 0:36:04| And then we rely on the dispatcher then to verbally give us that call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=2164)|
| 0:36:09| And sometimes they may have to step in and override.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=2169)|
| 0:36:12| The computer may be recommending one thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=2172)|
| 0:36:14| but they know this officer is close or this officer is busy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=2174)|
| 0:36:18| So one set of protocols to determine who to send,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=2178)|
| 0:36:21| and then another set of protocols as far as agencies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=2181)|
| 0:36:23| and then the agency's protocols gets into more specifics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=2183)|
| 0:36:31| The other question I have is about animal control.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=2191)|
| 0:36:34| You said there's certain animal control agents within the city police?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=2194)|
| 0:36:40| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=2200)|
| 0:36:41| Yes, the police department, I think sheriff's department still has theirs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=2201)|
| 0:36:45| So both law enforcement agencies have a unit within the department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=2205)|
| 0:36:49| These are uniformed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=2209)|
| 0:36:50| They're technically civilians.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=2210)|
| 0:36:52| They're not sworn police officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=2212)|
| 0:36:54| They're not post-certified at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=2214)|
| 0:36:56| They receive an extensive amount of training when they come in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=2216)|
| 0:36:58| They have their own levels of certification for dealing with the animals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=2218)|
| 0:37:01| But then they handle those animal calls for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=2221)|
| 0:37:04| It could be a stray.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=2224)|
| 0:37:05| It could be even something like a dog bite.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=2225)|
| 0:37:08| It could be a nuisance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=2228)|
| 0:37:09| It could be a mistreated or a concern about an animal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=2229)|
| 0:37:13| But they then handle the animal-related calls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=2233)|
| 0:37:16| They can also issue citations for ordinance violations that are related to the animals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=2236)|
| 0:37:21| And then they can only call on us, really, if they need a hand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=2241)|
| 0:37:25| As far as if they go in and someone's upset, they feel uncomfortable being in that situation alone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=2245)|
| 0:37:30| they'll call for an officer to help them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=2250)|
| 0:37:32| But yeah, we have our own unit that handles every bit of that for us within the department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=2252)|
| 0:37:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=2257)|
| 0:37:38| And then how many civilian officers, employees are there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=2258)|
| 0:37:44| What roles do they play?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=2264)|
| 0:37:45| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=2265)|
| 0:37:46| So we have civilian employees, which the number would be probably shy of 100.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=2266)|
| 0:37:52| About 90.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=2272)|
| 0:37:53| About 90 civilian employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=2273)|
| 0:37:55| And then we kind of break them down into uniform and non-uniform civilians.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=2275)|
| 0:37:59| So when we talk our uniform civilians, like the animal control,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=2279)|
| 0:38:02| some other examples of those you'll see are the transportation officers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=2282)|
| 0:38:07| that drive our transportation vans carrying the prisoners from the officers to the intake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=2287)|
| 0:38:12| Those are civilians, but they're uniform.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=2292)|
| 0:38:15| Our cadet program, which is designed to catch folks out of high school or early years of college,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=2295)|
| 0:38:21| we bring them in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=2301)|
| 0:38:22| They help us with parking control downtown Fort Sanders area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=2302)|
| 0:38:25| They help us with special events.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=2305)|
| 0:38:27| They work in our tele-serve unit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=2307)|
| 0:38:28| They are classified as a civilian.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=2308)|
| 0:38:30| They are uniform.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=2310)|
| 0:38:31| Our forensics folks, our CSI kind of folks, they are civilians.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=2311)|
| 0:38:36| There are some sworn members of that unit, but the majority of them are civilian uniform as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=2316)|
| 0:38:42| So several of our units we're utilizing the civilian side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=2322)|
| 0:38:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=2326)|
| 0:38:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=2328)|
| 0:38:49| Yes, absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=2329)|
| 0:38:58| Does anybody else have any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=2338)|
| 0:39:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=2340)|
| 0:39:01| Council Member Roberto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=2341)|
| 0:39:04| Thank you, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=2344)|
| 0:39:05| I was wondering, thanks for going through the categories of the different calls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=2345)|
| 0:39:10| Have you noticed any trends in those calls?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=2350)|
| 0:39:14| You know, there's a lot of categories there that, you know, you reviewed with us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=2354)|
| 0:39:20| but are you seeing increases in some areas and decreases in others over a period of time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=2360)|
| 0:39:26| Just be interested in what your thoughts are on an analysis of that, of those trends.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=2366)|
| 0:39:34| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=2374)|
| 0:39:35| No, great question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=2375)|
| 0:39:36| I'll be honest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=2376)|
| 0:39:37| I have not compared these numbers to years past, so I can't speak 100%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=2377)|
| 0:39:41| I can tell you in looking over them and having looked over previous years, nothing really jumped out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=2381)|
| 0:39:45| We usually see a pretty steady trend in most of our categories.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=2385)|
| 0:39:49| You'll see spikes or dips year to year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=2389)|
| 0:39:52| I don't have that to tell you for certain, but nothing jumped out at me having seen some of these numbers before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=2392)|
| 0:39:59| I think, if I can jump in, one of the things with us putting the code S for the mental health calls,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=2399)|
| 0:40:04| because we may get a domestic, we may get a homeless person, a call, a suspicious person,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=2404)|
| 0:40:10| and it turns out being a mental health issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=2410)|
| 0:40:12| So that code S, as we use it more and more, will help us determine that those were mental health issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=2412)|
| 0:40:18| rather than a suspicious person or a domestic problem, or it had that component.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=2418)|
| 0:40:23| So as we use that more and more, that may help us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=2423)|
| 0:40:26| But I'm of the same opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=2426)|
| 0:40:28| I don't think we've noticed any big trends in one call or another over the years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=2428)|
| 0:40:33| Could we do that as a follow-up to the workshop and just look and see if there were any trends over a period of time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=2433)|
| 0:40:42| I think that would be interesting to just know if you're seeing more or less,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=2442)|
| 0:40:46| and if it's very similar from year to year, that would be interesting too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=2446)|
| 0:40:52| So thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=2452)|
| 0:40:55| Maybe the last five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=2455)|
| 0:40:57| About the last five years, would that be good, Councilman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=2457)|
| 0:41:00| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=2460)|
| 0:41:03| Councilwoman Testerman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=2463)|
| 0:41:06| On that note, Chief Thomas, talking about the mental health calls and just doing a recent coding of that category,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=2466)|
| 0:41:14| are you all comfortable at this point to project what that 1% effectively would be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=2474)|
| 0:41:23| taking into account the other calls, the calls that Teleserve is helping with?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=2483)|
| 0:41:28| I mean, is there a guesstimation on what you think that percentage is truistic?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=2488)|
| 0:41:34| The only thing would be in your analysis report, the fact that Sergeant Britt will go over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=2494)|
| 0:41:41| That's probably the only thing we have right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=2501)|
| 0:41:43| But that's what I would project is as we recognize this more and more, that will probably go up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=2503)|
| 0:41:49| because we're able to code those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=2509)|
| 0:41:51| And with that, I guess in responding to those calls or answering those calls,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=2511)|
| 0:41:56| I'm guessing either with CIT or whatever, is there criteria that I guess the responders are looking at to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=2516)|
| 0:42:05| okay, I guess I'm just saying I'm curious about the criteria as these calls come in as to coding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=2525)|
| 0:42:13| I'm sure some of these calls too sort of cross boundaries and can be coded in multiple categories.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=2533)|
| 0:42:20| Right, yes, and we will talk about that a little bit more when I talk about CIT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=2540)|
| 0:42:24| We have what's called a mental health tracking form that officers are supposed to fill out if they come into contact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=2544)|
| 0:42:28| with someone they believe is suffering from a mental illness| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=2548)|
| 0:42:31| or exhibiting some sort of crisis during our interaction with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=2551)|
| 0:42:36| And so we can talk a little bit about some of that criteria.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=2556)|
| 0:42:39| All of our officers, and I don't mean to jump ahead very much,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=2559)|
| 0:42:42| but all of our officers have the basic core curriculum for CIT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=2562)|
| 0:42:46| Every officer at KPD has that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=2566)|
| 0:42:49| There are some officers who go through the full 40-hour course to become certified as CIT officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=2569)|
| 0:42:55| So all of the officers know, based on the core curriculum, the signs and symptoms of someone exhibiting mental illness,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=2575)|
| 0:43:02| what a crisis is, the definition of that, and how to address that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=2582)|
| 0:43:07| So those are the criteria that officers look at when they're determining whether they're dealing with someone in crisis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=2587)|
| 0:43:12| or maybe exhibiting a mental illness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=2592)|
| 0:43:15| Does that make sense? Do I need to go more in depth?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=2595)|
| 0:43:17| No. No, it's good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=2597)|
| 0:43:18| And just to clarify, on the call volume, like I said, some of those calls can cross boundaries on what they could be coded as,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=2598)|
| 0:43:25| but I presume that there's only one code per call, not multiple codes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=2605)|
| 0:43:32| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=2612)|
| 0:43:33| And you're right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=2613)|
| 0:43:34| You may have an overlapping.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=2614)|
| 0:43:36| So especially once you start to investigate it and realize what you have, it could be multiple calls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=2616)|
| 0:43:41| But at the end of the day, it's going to get coded one way as far as this information is concerned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=2621)|
| 0:43:46| Once it comes to the crime report and the investigation and potentially prosecution, now we can separate them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=2626)|
| 0:43:53| But I don't want you to think that it has to stay that way through the system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=2633)|
| 0:43:56| But as far as that original coding, it typically gets narrowed down to one point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=2636)|
| 0:44:01| Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=2641)|
| 0:44:03| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=2643)|
| 0:44:04| So let me, okay, Counselor Ryder, I'll let you go and then I'll jump in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=2644)|
| 0:44:09| I'll ask a quick question. I know you guys are shocked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=2649)|
| 0:44:13| The coding for the mental health crisis, code S, you've called it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=2653)|
| 0:44:18| Okay. So that started in 2019?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=2658)|
| 0:44:22| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=2662)|
| 0:44:24| Is there something that, I guess I'm surprised that we just started using that code in 2019.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=2664)|
| 0:44:30| Is there something that prompted it that year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=2670)|
| 0:44:34| I don't know. Why the change in 2019?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=2674)|
| 0:44:37| I think it was just, I think what came about was we were looking for more grants to promote the co-response team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=2677)|
| 0:44:44| And so we were looking for a better way to track how many mental health calls we were actually responding to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=2684)|
| 0:44:49| or people that we were dealing with that had a mental health illness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=2689)|
| 0:44:52| And we were realizing that we didn't have a very accurate way of tracking that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=2692)|
| 0:44:55| And so that was us trying to get better data on, you know, consumers that we were encountering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=2695)|
| 0:45:01| I think initially too, and I was not in a lot of these conversations, but I can remember the discussions about HIPAA violations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=2701)|
| 0:45:07| We had to be careful about assigning something to people and how we track people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=2707)|
| 0:45:12| Because, you know, mental health issues may have a HIPAA component to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=2712)|
| 0:45:17| So we wanted to be sure that, you know, we had to be sure that the coding didn't violate somebody's rights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=2717)|
| 0:45:22| So when the coding happens, it can also be tracked back to a name because the incident report or the citation or whatever might have a name on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=2722)|
| 0:45:31| Okay. And you've tagged it as mental health.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=2731)|
| 0:45:34| I just, over time, you know, when you talk to officers who've been with KPD for a long time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=2734)|
| 0:45:40| they'll tell you we deal with more and more mental health issues or more and more this issues or more and more of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=2740)|
| 0:45:47| So I'm surprised that, I see your point as to why we weren't coding it that way before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=2747)|
| 0:45:53| I just, it's surprising. So, okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=2753)|
| 0:45:57| Well, look, one other thing too is in 2018, when every officer received that core curriculum,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=2757)|
| 0:46:02| they were able to recognize those issues a little better too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=2762)|
| 0:46:05| So I think that's part of it. There's a whole lot of things that contributed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=2765)|
| 0:46:09| So it did take us a while to actually come up with that code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=2769)|
| 0:46:12| But I think, you know, it just evolved maybe more slowly here than other places, maybe more fast. I'm not sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=2772)|
| 0:46:19| And I'll be honest too, there's definitely a human side of that because those calls there on that shorter chart, like the code S,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=2779)|
| 0:46:26| that's upon the officer of how they're telling the dispatcher that they closed it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=2786)|
| 0:46:31| And as we continue to learn that, a lot of these are second nature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=2791)|
| 0:46:34| I mean, we learn to talk in these codes. So it's real easy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=2794)|
| 0:46:38| We're just used to the 1098-FI. And it's on us to make sure we say, and Sierra, to make sure that that gets entered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=2798)|
| 0:46:46| So I'll be honest, it's a new tool that we have, and we're still getting in that habit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=2806)|
| 0:46:52| I was just told via text by Captain Jones, who has worked extensively with General Ross-McNab and Sergeant Britt,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=2812)|
| 0:46:59| that the criteria are going to be developed with the mental health professionals during this upcoming grant opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=2819)|
| 0:47:07| that we have as well. So as we develop more and more criteria for finding out who has mental health issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=2827)|
| 0:47:13| or how we recognize those, that'll change too. So it'll probably continue to evolve as we get better at it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=2833)|
| 0:47:20| because we'll have some questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=2840)|
| 0:47:27| Councilwoman Ryder, is that? Okay. All right. So let me jump in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=2847)|
| 0:47:32| A couple of my questions have already been answered in the course of the conversation from my colleagues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=2852)|
| 0:47:37| But I would like to know, it's good to hear that all of the officers have the basic CTI training, CIT versus individual training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=2857)|
| 0:47:47| How many hours is the basic training?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=2867)|
| 0:47:52| It can occur between two and a half and three days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=2872)|
| 0:47:56| So when we did it in service and we did it for all sworn KPD officers, it was a three-day curriculum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=2876)|
| 0:48:03| Okay. And for the officers that come get the master level for the training, how long is that curriculum or training?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=2883)|
| 0:48:13| It's a 40-hour course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=2893)|
| 0:48:15| It's a 40-hour. Okay. Great. And so also I'd like to know, you guys talked about the partnerships| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=2895)|
| 0:48:27| and additional social services that are out there that actually assist us with a lot of the calls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=2907)|
| 0:48:33| And we've talked a lot about, you know, BHUD and some of those other alternatives to jail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=2913)|
| 0:48:40| Does anyone know how many beds collectively there are currently across all of those programs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=2920)|
| 0:48:50| I don't know collectively because what we have here through Helen Ross McNabb would be the CSU,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=2930)|
| 0:48:54| which is the Crisis Stabilization Unit, and also the BHUD.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=2934)|
| 0:48:57| So those are actually housed in the same building, and our officers drop off at both of those locations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=2937)|
| 0:49:02| But I don't know off the top of my head a total bed count through Helen Ross McNabb for those two facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=2942)|
| 0:49:08| We have Houston Smeltzer from here, and he might actually know the answer to that question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=2948)|
| 0:49:16| The actual physical beds for CSU, there are 16, and for BHUD, there are 15.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=2956)|
| 0:49:24| Okay. Thank you. Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=2964)|
| 0:49:26| And then in the course of that, of the first presentation, there was a statement that if the person is violent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=2966)|
| 0:49:36| they would not be eligible for any of those programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=2976)|
| 0:49:40| So could someone maybe tell me what happens with a person today that is violent in one of these calls,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=2980)|
| 0:49:46| but yet they're exhibiting some psychiatric symptoms?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=2986)|
| 0:49:50| So at this time, if they've broken the law, they go to jail,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=2990)|
| 0:49:54| and the jail actually provides services to the inmates while they're there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=2994)|
| 0:49:58| And Helen Ross McNabb, I believe, used to have that contract, and I don't believe they have it anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=2998)|
| 0:50:03| There are jail-based services for people who are suffering from mental illness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=3003)|
| 0:50:07| KPD doesn't have anything to do with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=3007)|
| 0:50:11| Okay. So can someone speak to maybe how quickly a person would get a psych eval in those situations?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=3011)|
| 0:50:19| Is it 48 hours? Is it within 72 hours?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=3019)|
| 0:50:24| I can't speak to that as it would take place in a jail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=3024)|
| 0:50:28| So once we put them in the wagon or transport them out to the facility, we don't have anything after that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=3028)|
| 0:50:36| Now, if someone is, if they make a statement to us potentially about saying that they want to kill themselves,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=3036)|
| 0:50:41| they're suicidal, then we let the jail staff know that, and so then they're put on watch while they're at the jail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=3041)|
| 0:50:47| But again, after we drop them off, we don't have anything to do with the process after that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=3047)|
| 0:50:53| Okay. So once they go into custody of the jail, then KPD is pretty much out of the equation as it relates to that person,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=3053)|
| 0:51:01| what goes on with them from there. Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=3061)|
| 0:51:04| Yes, ma'am, except for when it comes to time for court for their charges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=3064)|
| 0:51:08| Yes, as long as they're not in the jail, we're finished.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=3068)|
| 0:51:12| Okay. Great. Thank you for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=3072)|
| 0:51:14| And, counsel, if you'll just bear with me, I have a couple more questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=3074)|
| 0:51:18| I actually wanted to ask about the officer-initiated traffic stops.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=3078)|
| 0:51:21| I noticed that that number was over 21,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=3081)|
| 0:51:26| Can you speak a little bit about what is an instance where an officer would call for backup in a traffic stop?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=3086)|
| 0:51:35| Sure. It could be for a number of reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=3095)|
| 0:51:38| It could be something traffic-related.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=3098)|
| 0:51:40| If the officer makes a traffic stop in a place that's hazardous for traffic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=3100)|
| 0:51:46| we're trying to make those stops out of the way, posing a problem with the roadway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=3106)|
| 0:51:51| But if the offender stops in such a way that we want to get an additional car there to try to warn other drivers while we're dealing with this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=3111)|
| 0:51:57| oftentimes that's in the case of an intoxicated person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=3117)|
| 0:52:00| If you make the traffic stop and realize you have multiple people in the car and you would just like an extra set of eyes there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=3120)|
| 0:52:07| because whether you're cordially engaged in the conversation about this encounter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=3127)|
| 0:52:12| or if you're following up on a more serious criminal activity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=3132)|
| 0:52:16| you're focused to that and you're not paying attention to the traffic around you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=3136)|
| 0:52:20| maybe you just want an extra set of eyes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=3140)|
| 0:52:22| If it's a DUI, as I mentioned earlier, you may like an additional officer there for a lot of those reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=3142)|
| 0:52:28| Maybe you're going to wind up in a course of paperwork and you just want an extra set of hands to help you there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=3148)|
| 0:52:34| Oftentimes, though, it's for officer safety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=3154)|
| 0:52:36| You're just looking for an extra set of eyes or maybe an extra set of warning lights behind you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=3156)|
| 0:52:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=3161)|
| 0:52:42| And I'm sure I know you guys will not know the answer to this question, but if you would maybe just take this down as a takeaway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=3162)|
| 0:52:49| I have noticed over the years, especially in East Knoxville, that there tends to typically be anywhere from two to four,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=3169)|
| 0:52:57| sometimes, officers that will be on a stop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=3177)|
| 0:53:00| Again, I'm not sure exactly what the situation is, but that can be a little concerning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=3180)|
| 0:53:07| And so if you could just maybe take away and just come back to me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=3187)|
| 0:53:10| and let me know what percentage of those officer-initiated traffic stops,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=3190)|
| 0:53:15| if you have that information, are East Knoxville versus north, south, and west.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=3195)|
| 0:53:22| If you would, I would appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=3202)|
| 0:53:24| And no rush on that, but if you could just get that information back to me maybe within the next week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=3204)|
| 0:53:29| week and a half, if that's not asking too much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=3209)|
| 0:53:32| I also wanted to ask the question about suspicious person calls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=3212)|
| 0:53:38| That one actually jumped out at me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=3218)|
| 0:53:40| That was over 13,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=3220)|
| 0:53:44| And I guess I'd like to ask you, when a person calls in and says, hey, there's a suspicious person,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=3224)|
| 0:53:50| what additional information, if you know the answer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=3230)|
| 0:53:53| what probing questions are potentially asked of what makes the person suspicious?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=3233)|
| 0:53:59| If you'll allow me time to look up, I can give you the questions that that 9-1-1 taker would ask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=3239)|
| 0:54:06| If you'll bear with me a few minutes, I can come back to that in time to pull that up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=3246)|
| 0:54:10| I can also tell you, too, that sometimes those calls are going to be officer-initiated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=3250)|
| 0:54:15| So remember, these calls may be someone calling into 9-1-1| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=3255)|
| 0:54:19| or it may be the officer creating that call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=3259)|
| 0:54:23| So the officer may be out, they see someone around a closed business or looking into cars,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=3263)|
| 0:54:28| and they're going to let the dispatcher know I'll be out with a suspicious person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=3268)|
| 0:54:32| So that could have been the officer's observation could have generated those calls as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=3272)|
| 0:54:37| I'll be glad to look up the questions that would be asked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=3277)|
| 0:54:41| Okay, great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=3281)|
| 0:54:42| Then I also, again, I know that the mental health, the mental crisis code is new.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=3282)|
| 0:54:50| But, you know, when I look at the number where we have the drug overdoses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=3290)|
| 0:54:55| where we have the threatened suicide, both of those, of course, being over 1,000 each,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=3295)|
| 0:55:03| attempted suicide with injury and suicide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=3303)|
| 0:55:08| And then tell me, how does that correlate when it says there's a category that said mental person?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=3308)|
| 0:55:15| There were 79 in that category.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=3315)|
| 0:55:17| Would that just be someone that maybe is exhibiting mental health issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=3317)|
| 0:55:23| but they are not saying that they're suicidal or homicidal?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=3323)|
| 0:55:27| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=3327)|
| 0:55:28| In that category, someone has called 9-1-1,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=3328)|
| 0:55:31| and the description that they have given of the reason that they're wanting police,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=3331)|
| 0:55:35| they're explaining that someone is exhibiting, in their opinion, what would be a mental crisis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=3335)|
| 0:55:41| So we have to remember that that is the perception of the caller, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=3341)|
| 0:55:44| And that may be family and someone who's very much aware,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=3344)|
| 0:55:47| or it could be a bystander seeing something and making their own assumptions sometimes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=3347)|
| 0:55:51| And so, again, we still want to get there in health, regardless of what the perception may be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=3351)|
| 0:55:56| If there's someone in need, we want to cover that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=3356)|
| 0:55:58| But how it's coded on the front end, so that's where someone has not given one of these other categories,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=3358)|
| 0:56:04| as you mentioned, like suicide, drug overdose, illness, what have you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=3364)|
| 0:56:08| But the caller has specifically said there's a mental issue with this person, and that alone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=3368)|
| 0:56:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=3374)|
| 0:56:15| And also, I looked at what jumped out at me, the indecent exposure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=3375)|
| 0:56:22| That was at 372.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=3382)|
| 0:56:24| So once that situation is assessed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=3384)|
| 0:56:27| I'm sure there's a high probability that some of those are due to mental health issues as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=3387)|
| 0:56:33| Do those get coded again as well, or does it just stand as indecent exposure?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=3393)|
| 0:56:39| It could be recoded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=3399)|
| 0:56:41| I will tell you from experience, a lot of those wind up being intoxicated individuals urinating in public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=3401)|
| 0:56:47| That winds up being a good part of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=3407)|
| 0:56:49| And some of those are rendezvous after hours, if you will,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=3409)|
| 0:56:54| and they didn't hide as well as they might have thought they were hiding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=3414)|
| 0:56:58| So consensual encounters and just had a bigger audience than they might have thought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=3418)|
| 0:57:03| So those account for that category the most, but they could be recoded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=3423)|
| 0:57:10| But again, that's on now the part of the officer to say, change this from an indecent exposure to a new code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=3430)|
| 0:57:19| So if that is the case, then we have to take that step.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=3439)|
| 0:57:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=3443)|
| 0:57:24| And then I saw on the welfare checks that there were close to 10,000 on the welfare checks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=3444)|
| 0:57:30| In your opinion, do the welfare checks normally tend to turn out to be just maybe a senior or someone that family member just hasn't spoken to recently?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=3450)|
| 0:57:39| Do you guys ever encounter a welfare check to be something that is potentially dangerous?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=3459)|
| 0:57:46| You can't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=3466)|
| 0:57:47| A lot of times you haven't heard from a loved one and you go there and that's usually what those are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=3467)|
| 0:57:51| I haven't heard from, and it could be a grandmother in a few days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=3471)|
| 0:57:55| And sometimes you get there and they're not there at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=3475)|
| 0:57:58| They've relocated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=3478)|
| 0:57:59| We've gotten there and they're okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=3479)|
| 0:58:00| And unfortunately we've got there sometimes and they pass away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=3480)|
| 0:58:03| And we found that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=3483)|
| 0:58:05| Children that we've not heard from, especially in custody issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=3485)|
| 0:58:09| The child hasn't shown up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=3489)|
| 0:58:10| It's Saturday afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=3490)|
| 0:58:12| We're supposed to trade off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=3492)|
| 0:58:13| And I haven't heard from them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=3493)|
| 0:58:16| You may also, I know that a friend of mine is in a bad relationship and I haven't heard from him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=3496)|
| 0:58:23| So I want somebody to go check.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=3503)|
| 0:58:24| And we arrive and sure enough, you may walk into an active domestic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=3504)|
| 0:58:28| So it could be for a number of reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=3508)|
| 0:58:31| But I would tell you, yeah, well, probably not the majority by no means, but you will encounter some vile tendencies with those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=3511)|
| 0:58:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=3518)|
| 0:58:39| And so this might be my last question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=3519)|
| 0:58:43| I wonder from the welfare checks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=3523)|
| 0:58:45| And then you also have a category that's dead person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=3525)|
| 0:58:48| There were like 462 of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=3528)|
| 0:58:50| If you go on a welfare check and you do find a person is deceased within a home and it appears to be natural causes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=3530)|
| 0:58:56| Does that one also correlate into that person or would that still be standalone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=3536)|
| 0:59:01| That one would be recoded because we're going to now we're going to have an investigation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=3541)|
| 0:59:06| It will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=3546)|
| 0:59:07| They're both investigations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=3547)|
| 0:59:08| But I mean, a follow up investigation, you know, it went from knocking on the door and you were okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=3548)|
| 0:59:12| And we just say, hey, so and so and whatever state's looking for you when you check in to now we notice this deceased person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=3552)|
| 0:59:20| That's going to trigger an entire investigation for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=3560)|
| 0:59:23| So that one would be recoded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=3563)|
| 0:59:26| I'm pretty confident in that, that we've done a good job of recoding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=3566)|
| 0:59:32| Just because we got a follow up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=3572)|
| 0:59:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=3574)|
| 0:59:36| And again, I think the domestic trouble kind of speaks to itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=3576)|
| 0:59:41| That's over 11,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=3581)|
| 0:59:43| And then disturbance at 18,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=3583)|
| 0:59:47| So disturbance, you've got a disturbance and then you also have disturbance with weapon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=3587)|
| 0:59:52| So would that be maybe and, you know, if there's people just hanging out late at night and they're loud, that kind of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=3592)|
| 1:00:01| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=3601)|
| 1:00:02| Do you maybe help me understand what that definition would look like?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=3602)|
| 1:00:06| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=3606)|
| 1:00:07| So the disturbance could be my neighbors working on a car and they're revving the motor and it's 11 o'clock tonight and I would like to get some rest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=3607)|
| 1:00:16| It may be a disturbance, but it's just sort of a physical altercation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=3616)|
| 1:00:20| I'm into it with this person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=3620)|
| 1:00:22| We're out at the shopping center or what have you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=3622)|
| 1:00:25| This altercation is occurring, not physically fighting, but they're in a verbal altercation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=3625)|
| 1:00:30| Those are going to be disturbances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=3630)|
| 1:00:32| It could be a loud party.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=3632)|
| 1:00:34| And we have a code for parties, but let's say that we have a party that is spilling out into the street and the neighbors are calling in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=3634)|
| 1:00:41| That would be a disturbance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=3641)|
| 1:00:43| Where it would change to a weapon is, again, you're just shy of that fight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=3643)|
| 1:00:48| The neighbors are standing out arguing and one of them's now got a stick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=3648)|
| 1:00:52| Well, that just went from a disturbance to a disturbance with a weapon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=3652)|
| 1:00:56| And it changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=3656)|
| 1:00:57| That code would then change because that weapon has been introduced to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=3657)|
| 1:01:01| So it's kind of a broad category, but it's just shy of a physical fight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=3661)|
| 1:01:06| Shots fired.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=3666)|
| 1:01:07| Shots fired would be a disturbance call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=3667)|
| 1:01:09| I'm here shooting a few streets over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=3669)|
| 1:01:11| That's another good example of a disturbance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=3671)|
| 1:01:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=3674)|
| 1:01:15| I would be interested, if it's not a lot of trouble, to get maybe the demographics on disturbance calls and disturbance with weapon involved, the demographic of what area those calls are coming from as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=3675)|
| 1:01:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=3690)|
| 1:01:31| And then I think my last question is, I know that each of us get calls and we get emails and we're in conversations about our homeless population.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=3691)|
| 1:01:40| And I do know that there are people who call with complaints regarding homeless individuals in their neighborhoods and different things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=3700)|
| 1:01:50| Aside from a homeless person trying to break and enter into a vehicle or a place of business or a home, if someone calls and complains about a homeless person in their community, how is that call categorized?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=3710)|
| 1:02:05| It could be a number of ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=3725)|
| 1:02:07| And I would tell you that depending on the information that the call taker is receiving about that person is how it would be coded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=3727)|
| 1:02:14| So I've seen those type of calls coded as suspicious persons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=3734)|
| 1:02:18| So someone walking through the neighborhood, walking through yards, over in a vacant lot, it could be coded as suspicious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=3738)|
| 1:02:26| It could be coded as a prowler on the premise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=3746)|
| 1:02:32| A lot of times you'll see a property owner will call in because there's a vagrant on maybe an empty house that they're waiting to rent or an abandoned property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=3752)|
| 1:02:40| And it will be called in as a prowler on the premise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=3760)|
| 1:02:44| It could be called in as an indecent exposure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=3764)|
| 1:02:48| So someone sees the homeless camp across the way and they're out using the restroom in public or what have you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=3768)|
| 1:02:54| So as you mentioned about the break-in, it really just depends on what goes along with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=3774)|
| 1:02:59| We don't have a call per se of just a homeless person because they're going to look for what else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=3779)|
| 1:03:06| What is that person doing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=3786)|
| 1:03:07| It's not that the person is suspicious or there's a problem with the person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=3787)|
| 1:03:10| It's the behavior that we're looking at when we code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=3790)|
| 1:03:14| And so they're going to, whatever triggers that they hear, they get them the closest to a code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=3794)|
| 1:03:21| How do you track that if you do have a call and you encounter a person who's homeless and they don't have a physical address?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=3801)|
| 1:03:29| Is that tracked anywhere?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=3809)|
| 1:03:32| Yes and no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=3812)|
| 1:03:36| Officer Brett Clinton, who many of you know well, he handles a lot of that and helps us with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=3816)|
| 1:03:41| I would tell you that as we complete, if any type of paperwork is completed, whether it's a field interview or if this results in a crime report, it would be noted there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=3821)|
| 1:03:52| But as far as the way that the call itself is coded, that in and of itself is tracked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=3832)|
| 1:04:00| So not tracked from the comp perspective, but once you're on the scene, is there a mechanism when you're inputting information in the system that it's tracked that the person did not have an address?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=3840)|
| 1:04:11| Yes, if a report is in fact made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=3851)|
| 1:04:15| So the officer might get there and, you know, when we look back to our codes, issue a warning to leave the property or settle the problem or they check that okay, there was no problem here at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=3855)|
| 1:04:25| There may be no documentation other than the call itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=3865)|
| 1:04:29| So if a crime has not occurred and there's nothing that the officer wants to document, they may just speak to them, resolve the situation and go on and then it in and of itself wouldn't be tracked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=3869)|
| 1:04:41| I mean, obviously the call, the officer's camera reporting, I don't mean to say that there's nothing, but as far as documentation, if the report or a field interview or some type of CIT tracking wasn't done, then we wouldn't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=3881)|
| 1:04:56| Okay, thank you. That's it for my questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=3896)|
| 1:04:59| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=3899)|
| 1:05:00| Councillor Wong-Tam.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=3900)|
| 1:05:03| Thank you, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=3903)|
| 1:05:04| So, Chief Thomas, what I'm gathering from all this is it's how the call is coded when it comes in determines how you respond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=3904)|
| 1:05:19| Because until you get there, you don't actually know what you're dealing with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=3919)|
| 1:05:23| And that's kind of a lot of what I'm picking up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=3923)|
| 1:05:26| It's what the citizen says when they call it in determines, that's all you have to go on initially.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=3926)|
| 1:05:34| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=3934)|
| 1:05:36| I think we just lost our audio.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=3936)|
| 1:05:39| Could everybody else hear?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=3939)|
| 1:05:42| She kind of faded out a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=3942)|
| 1:05:44| Okay, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=3944)|
| 1:05:46| Sorry, I'll get up really close to my computer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=3946)|
| 1:05:50| It's a little better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=3950)|
| 1:05:51| Okay, now y'all can see my face really big on the screen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=3951)|
| 1:05:56| Sorry about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=3956)|
| 1:05:59| I just said it sounds to me like a lot of how you respond depends on how the person calling in describes the activity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=3959)|
| 1:06:14| They may or may not describe it correctly, but that sounds like that's a lot of how we have to send people until we get there and see what we're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=3974)|
| 1:06:26| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=3986)|
| 1:06:27| That is very correct, very true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=3987)|
| 1:06:29| Because one of the things we talk about all the time is just because you get that information from a dispatcher, that may not be what's going on at that call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=3989)|
| 1:06:38| And so I learned early on, I think we all did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=3998)|
| 1:06:41| We formulate in our heads, hey, okay, this is what this call is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=4001)|
| 1:06:44| Here's how I'm going to respond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=4004)|
| 1:06:45| But we get there and it's totally different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=4005)|
| 1:06:47| So that's why it's so important to do it on the back end, change that code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=4007)|
| 1:06:51| But the other thing that we do have is we have a call taker's guide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=4011)|
| 1:06:55| We have a liaison with the 911 center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=4015)|
| 1:06:57| And that's what Lieutenant Schaefer used to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=4017)|
| 1:06:59| We have another lieutenant who does it now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=4019)|
| 1:07:05| But they help develop those questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=4025)|
| 1:07:07| If we find out we're getting a lot of calls like that, we'll submit some different questions for them to ask of those callers to try and help us with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=4027)|
| 1:07:14| But even at the end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=4034)|
| 1:07:15| More information before you send someone so that you're getting a little better information before you get there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=4035)|
| 1:07:21| And then I guess that begs the question then, when you think you're going to something really bad and it's not, what kind of training do officers get?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=4041)|
| 1:07:34| Because I'm sure you go with the adrenaline rushing if you think it's a really bad thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=4054)|
| 1:07:38| So what kind of training do officers get?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=4058)|
| 1:07:41| Because they've got to do something to de-escalate themselves and calm down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=4061)|
| 1:07:45| So could you speak to some of that maybe?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=4065)|
| 1:07:48| And I may be jumping ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=4068)|
| 1:07:51| But that's a question I have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=4071)|
| 1:07:54| No, no, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=4074)|
| 1:07:55| And you said the key word there with the de-escalation because that's going to come in multiple times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=4075)|
| 1:08:01| But at the recruit level, what we do is we do a lot with scenario-based training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=4081)|
| 1:08:06| And the greatest majority of our scenario-based training revolves around decision-making.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=4086)|
| 1:08:11| So we may, in the course of a scenario, do that very thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=4091)|
| 1:08:14| We send them to something that they think, and you've described it perfectly, but they're getting ramped up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=4094)|
| 1:08:19| They think this is, you know, the adrenaline's flowing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=4099)|
| 1:08:22| There may be more to it than there is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=4102)|
| 1:08:24| And then they get to realize it's nothing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=4104)|
| 1:08:26| And so we work through in that controlled environment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=4106)|
| 1:08:29| And then at the same time, we see just the opposite.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=4109)|
| 1:08:32| We get information in that this is just an everyday, another one of fill-in-the-blank calls,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=4112)|
| 1:08:38| and you get there and there's actually more to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=4118)|
| 1:08:41| It's just the welfare check that wound up being a violent domestic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=4121)|
| 1:08:44| And so now then the adrenaline's going in the other direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=4124)|
| 1:08:47| So at the basic recruit level, we're doing that with scenario-based training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=4127)|
| 1:08:51| Well, I can tell you, you know, because I help teach with tracking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=4131)|
| 1:08:54| and we talk about those adrenaline dumps and how to deal with that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=4134)|
| 1:08:57| and, you know, how to calm yourself back down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=4137)|
| 1:08:59| So that does happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=4139)|
| 1:09:01| And we try and train what to recognize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=4141)|
| 1:09:03| You know, when you have that adrenaline, you get tunnel vision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=4143)|
| 1:09:06| You don't see peripherally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=4146)|
| 1:09:08| And so we try and get them to recognize that and tricks to avoid losing focus| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=4148)|
| 1:09:11| or having too much focus on one thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=4151)|
| 1:09:14| It's something more that you learn by experience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=4154)|
| 1:09:17| So the scenario training is what works the best, really, in field training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=4157)|
| 1:09:22| When they go through their field training officer program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=4162)|
| 1:09:25| they learn a lot of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=4165)|
| 1:09:30| So you asked about the questions that you're going to get asked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=4170)|
| 1:09:32| on a suspicious person call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=4172)|
| 1:09:34| The first question is going to be, what is the location?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=4174)|
| 1:09:37| It's going to be, what is the suspicious action?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=4177)|
| 1:09:40| And the call taker is going to try to get, you know, like I said earlier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=4180)|
| 1:09:43| we're looking for behavior.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=4183)|
| 1:09:45| We're not looking about we need a description of a person, which is next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=4185)|
| 1:09:48| But what about that behavior is making them suspicious?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=4188)|
| 1:09:52| And that they can relate to the officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=4192)|
| 1:09:54| And does anyone have a weapon or did you see a weapon of any kind?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=4194)|
| 1:09:58| So those are the standard questions if someone calls in a suspicious person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=4198)|
| 1:10:04| I will go back to the question about while you're en route.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=4204)|
| 1:10:09| Our call takers and dispatchers both are very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=4209)|
| 1:10:12| If it's a crime in progress or something they're not feeling good about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=4212)|
| 1:10:15| they're going to keep that caller on the phone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=4215)|
| 1:10:17| and try to keep continuous information coming to the officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=4217)|
| 1:10:20| And it's not uncommon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=4220)|
| 1:10:22| And the dispatchers are doing the same thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=4222)|
| 1:10:24| working in conjunction with that call taker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=4224)|
| 1:10:26| And if information is changing or they're starting to get a better story| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=4226)|
| 1:10:29| or folks are calming down, they're able to de-escalate them on the phone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=4229)|
| 1:10:33| and get more details, then they're relaying that to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=4233)|
| 1:10:35| And, again, that can go in either direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=4235)|
| 1:10:37| Hey, we're getting more. There's more to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=4237)|
| 1:10:39| It's more violent. There's more people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=4239)|
| 1:10:41| Let's send additional resources. Somebody's hurt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=4241)|
| 1:10:43| Let's start an ambulance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=4243)|
| 1:10:45| Or, well, as we talk to them more, we think it may be more of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=4245)|
| 1:10:49| So our call takers and dispatchers do a great job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=4249)|
| 1:10:51| They're just not taking that call and dumping it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=4251)|
| 1:10:54| They're trying to hang in there and help us along the way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=4254)|
| 1:10:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=4259)|
| 1:11:02| Vice Mayor, I just wanted to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=4262)|
| 1:11:04| I have to go to the neighborhood award dinner event that starts at 530.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=4264)|
| 1:11:10| So I will have staff here to keep me posted on what's discussed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=4270)|
| 1:11:17| But thank you very much to KPD for all the reports and for council for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=4277)|
| 1:11:21| running this workshop. And I'll see you soon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=4281)|
| 1:11:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=4286)|
| 1:11:27| We said hello.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=4287)|
| 1:11:28| Yes. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=4288)|
| 1:11:30| I'll send them your regards and come by later if you have time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=4290)|
| 1:11:34| Well, not on your way home, but, you know, if you have time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=4294)|
| 1:11:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=4298)|
| 1:11:42| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=4302)|
| 1:11:47| We said we have the number of 911 calls,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=4307)|
| 1:11:49| but how many dispatches or officer on scene?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=4309)|
| 1:11:54| Incidents where they're during this period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=4314)|
| 1:11:56| Sorry if I missed this earlier, but.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=4316)|
| 1:11:58| Where the officer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=4318)|
| 1:11:59| Generated the call. You may.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=4319)|
| 1:12:01| No, we're an officer is on scene.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=4321)|
| 1:12:05| So we have 618,000 calls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=4325)|
| 1:12:08| No, it's not one-to-one, but.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=4328)|
| 1:12:10| As a result, how many times does an officer show up on scene?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=4330)|
| 1:12:13| Or maybe they're already there, but.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=4333)|
| 1:12:15| So I don't know if this dispatch is the right term or whatnot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=4335)|
| 1:12:18| Or how we took care of a call without an officer actually having to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=4338)|
| 1:12:21| physically get off the scene. Is that what you mean?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=4341)|
| 1:12:23| Yeah, that'd be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=4343)|
| 1:12:25| That would be the other half. Yeah. So just.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=4345)|
| 1:12:28| I don't have, I can, I can, I can come up with that for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=4348)|
| 1:12:31| I can tell you right away from the 618,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=4351)|
| 1:12:33| we have to immediately get down to the 301,000, which were our calls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=4353)|
| 1:12:37| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=4357)|
| 1:12:38| Related to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=4358)|
| 1:12:40| And then we can go through there and I'll be glad to do that before we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=4360)|
| 1:12:42| meet again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=4362)|
| 1:12:44| You know, like a good portion of those nine on one calls that were hangups.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=4364)|
| 1:12:47| It's only, and we're selling an officer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=4367)|
| 1:12:48| Never will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=4368)|
| 1:12:49| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=4369)|
| 1:12:50| It was canceled. We never went. So I can go through it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=4370)|
| 1:12:52| Those together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=4372)|
| 1:12:53| But I don't have that number as it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=4373)|
| 1:12:55| Okay. That'd be helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=4375)|
| 1:12:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=4376)|

| 1:13:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=4407)|
| 1:13:28| That'd be helpful. I think just the 301,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=4408)|
| 1:13:30| how many end up with an officer onsite involved and how many don't?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=4410)|
| 1:13:34| So I feel like we're hanging out some missed dials and change of mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=4414)|
| 1:13:37| And also kind of resolved over the phone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=4417)|
| 1:13:38| All fit into the bucket of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=4418)|
| 1:13:39| Officer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=4419)|
| 1:13:40| Chief Thomas, have you guys been in discussion about 9-8-8?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=4420)|
| 1:13:44| I have no idea what 9-8-8 is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=4424)|
| 1:13:49| It's the, FCC just approved it about six months ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=4429)|
| 1:13:54| They want to have 9-1-1 for crime and 9-8-8 for mental illness and make it a national| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=4434)|
| 1:14:02| number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=4442)|
| 1:14:03| It started as a suicide hotline, but they've expanded it to, it's a good way to separate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=4443)|
| 1:14:09| crime from mental illness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=4449)|
| 1:14:11| And it's still in Congress, so who knows when we'll see it, but Georgia has put a lot of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=4451)|
| 1:14:18| that in, they're practicing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=4458)|
| 1:14:23| And they're finding a really, 90% of the calls that go to 9-8-8 are dealt with on the phone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=4463)|
| 1:14:30| And they're connected with all of the mental health agencies, so they're able to get them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=4470)|
| 1:14:34| right where they need to be and then police can do police work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=4474)|
| 1:14:39| I'm for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=4479)|
| 1:14:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=4480)|
| 1:14:41| That's what I wanted to know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=4481)|
| 1:14:42| Or we could do something with 3-1-1 that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=4482)|
| 1:14:43| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=4483)|
| 1:14:44| There may be some other options in the meantime.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=4484)|
| 1:14:48| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=4488)|
| 1:14:49| Until it comes out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=4489)|
| 1:14:50| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=4490)|
| 1:14:51| And when I follow up with 9-1-1 about some of these questions, I'll ask if they're, if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=4491)|
| 1:14:55| Mr. Brad Anders, our 9-1-1 director, if he's heard that, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=4495)|
| 1:15:00| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=4500)|
| 1:15:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=4501)|
| 1:15:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=4502)|
| 1:15:04| I had a question similar to what was just discussed, but going back to the conversation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=4504)|
| 1:15:12| about partnerships, could you speak more about that mobile crisis unit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=4512)|
| 1:15:17| I think you were saying that it was more active around when you started in the mid-90s, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=4517)|
| 1:15:24| doesn't answer calls the way it did, or could you tell me more?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=4524)|
| 1:15:27| And that's why I had to, I probably had to let Sergeant Britt speak to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=4527)|
| 1:15:31| When I first started in the early 90s, we could call for mobile crisis if we were on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=4531)|
| 1:15:36| a scene and we were dealing with somebody that we thought, this is a mental issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=4536)|
| 1:15:40| They're probably going to end up going to Lakeshore and mobile crisis could come out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=4540)|
| 1:15:44| and determine right then, we could take them to Lakeshore and we could get them committed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=4544)|
| 1:15:49| right there on the scene.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=4549)|
| 1:15:51| Now mobile crisis response to the hospital, I'll let Sergeant Britt go into that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=4551)|
| 1:15:54| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=4554)|
| 1:15:55| So mobile crisis will still come to the scene.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=4555)|
| 1:15:56| There was a period where the governor did not allow them to due to COVID, but they are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=4556)|
| 1:16:00| now back to responding in the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=4560)|
| 1:16:03| The problem we have is they cover five counties, so they may be on a scene five counties away| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=4563)|
| 1:16:09| and we're asking them to come evaluate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=4569)|
| 1:16:11| So they may say, can you please get them to an ER and we will evaluate them once we get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=4571)|
| 1:16:16| to the hospital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=4576)|
| 1:16:17| It's simply a matter of what's safer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=4577)|
| 1:16:19| One of the other things they take into consideration is where are we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=4579)|
| 1:16:23| Are we in a controlled environment like a house?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=4583)|
| 1:16:26| Are we on the side of the road?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=4586)|
| 1:16:28| If it's something that's going to be more dangerous or hazardous for them to respond| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=4588)|
| 1:16:31| to the scene, that's another time they may say, hey, can you go ahead and take them to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=4591)|
| 1:16:35| a hospital and then we'll evaluate them when they get there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=4595)|
| 1:16:38| They are still mobile in the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=4598)|
| 1:16:41| But again, with them serving five counties, it's sometimes a little bit more difficult| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=4601)|
| 1:16:46| to get them to exactly where we are at the moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=4606)|
| 1:16:50| And do you know, have they ever served as first responders?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=4610)|
| 1:16:54| Or they've always been called to the scene by law enforcement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=4614)|
| 1:16:57| I do know they do go into the community on their own.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=4617)|
| 1:17:00| There are a lot of times they will call for us to assist them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=4620)|
| 1:17:04| I can't give you that number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=4624)|
| 1:17:05| But a lot of 911 calls will come from Mobile Crisis and they'll say, hey, we've been talking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=4625)|
| 1:17:10| to this person on the phone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=4630)|
| 1:17:11| We're concerned about their well-being.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=4631)|
| 1:17:13| Can you go check on them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=4633)|
| 1:17:14| So they've said something that Mobile Crisis is seeing is a potential threat or something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=4634)|
| 1:17:19| that's dangerous and they want us to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=4639)|
| 1:17:22| They've also said, hey, we are in route to evaluate a person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=4642)|
| 1:17:26| Can you please meet us there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=4646)|
| 1:17:27| We have some safety concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=4647)|
| 1:17:29| And if that's the case, we will stand by while Mobile Crisis does the assessment on the scene.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=4649)|
| 1:17:34| Does that answer your question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=4654)|
| 1:17:36| It does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=4656)|
| 1:17:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=4657)|
| 1:17:38| Now, is the public contacting them through this, through 911 or is that a separate number| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=4658)|
| 1:17:44| that allows them to get dispatched?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=4664)|
| 1:17:48| No, they, Mobile Crisis, they have their own phone number and it's made in 24 hours a day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=4668)|
| 1:17:52| seven days a week by clinicians and they answer that themselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=4672)|
| 1:17:56| That's through Helen Ross McNabb.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=4676)|
| 1:17:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=4677)|
| 1:17:58| Gotcha.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=4678)|
| 1:17:59| So 911 would never dispatch or never, I guess, doesn't have a direct connection to the Mobile| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=4679)|
| 1:18:03| Crisis unit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=4683)|
| 1:18:04| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=4684)|
| 1:18:05| Only Mobile Crisis calls them and says, hey, can you send me an officer or can you send| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=4685)|
| 1:18:09| an officer to check on this person?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=4689)|
| 1:18:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=4692)|
| 1:18:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=4693)|
| 1:18:14| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=4694)|
| 1:18:15| Are we ready to go into Sergeant Britt's presentation or any more questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=4695)|
| 1:18:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=4702)|
| 1:18:23| I think we're good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=4703)|
| 1:18:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=4705)|
| 1:18:26| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=4706)|
| 1:18:27| Can you all hear her okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=4707)|
| 1:18:28| Or is it better if she gets to the back?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=4708)|
| 1:18:29| I have a loud voice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=4709)|
| 1:18:30| I got kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=4710)|
| 1:18:31| I can talk loud.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=4711)|
| 1:18:32| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=4712)|
| 1:18:33| So CIT, it stands for Crisis Intervention Team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=4713)|
| 1:18:34| And that's the entire premise behind CIT is it takes a team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=4714)|
| 1:18:43| So it was actually developed in 1987 in the city of Memphis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=4723)|
| 1:18:47| They had an incident with an individual that was suffering from mental illness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=4727)|
| 1:18:50| He was in crisis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=4730)|
| 1:18:51| Police got involved, unfortunately ended up having to use deadly force.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=4731)|
| 1:18:56| And so the community came together and said, hey, how can we address mental health in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=4736)|
| 1:19:00| city?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=4740)|
| 1:19:01| So there were a few people that worked together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=4741)|
| 1:19:03| The mayor of Memphis worked with NAMI, worked with the police, with mental health professionals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=4743)|
| 1:19:08| And they started the CIT program in Memphis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=4748)|
| 1:19:11| We got it here in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=4751)|
| 1:19:12| I believe Captain Jones and Candace Allen from Home Runs McNabb attended their first| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=4752)|
| 1:19:17| training in 2011 and then actually conducted the first training for KPD in 2012.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=4757)|
| 1:19:23| So what CIT is, it's a community response to people who are experiencing some sort of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=4763)|
| 1:19:30| crisis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=4770)|
| 1:19:31| It doesn't have to be a mental health crisis, but a lot of times it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=4771)|
| 1:19:34| And so what happens is you have agencies that work together to try to address those issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=4774)|
| 1:19:42| So currently we have a regional CIT board that's comprised of Helen Ross McNabb, KPD,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=4782)|
| 1:19:47| KPSO, AAR is coming back to the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=4787)|
| 1:19:50| You have the University of Tennessee Medical Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=4790)|
| 1:19:53| We train both security and actually the emergency department staff at UT to handle these situations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=4793)|
| 1:20:03| We've also trained Blount County Alcoa PD.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=4803)|
| 1:20:06| So it's an outreach of several different agencies and partners in the community to try to address| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=4806)|
| 1:20:12| the mental health issues that we see in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=4812)|
| 1:20:14| So we train the recruits through the core curriculum training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=4814)|
| 1:20:17| Like I said, we train other agencies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=4817)|
| 1:20:20| We've trained dispatch in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=4820)|
| 1:20:23| We're trying at this last training, we actually taught the recruits for the Knox County School| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=4823)|
| 1:20:26| Security.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=4826)|
| 1:20:27| So their current recruit class has been through the full 40 hour course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=4827)|
| 1:20:32| We have recently brought in Covenant Health.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=4832)|
| 1:20:34| We've been trying to get them on board for several years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=4834)|
| 1:20:38| Two of their security actually attended our training that we just had in the beginning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=4838)|
| 1:20:42| of July.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=4842)|
| 1:20:43| So we're trying, we attended the, we always attend the international CIT conference and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=4843)|
| 1:20:49| we actually presented a couple of years ago, we presented a workshop and we said, hey,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=4849)|
| 1:20:54| this is how we're doing it in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=4854)|
| 1:20:56| And so we were actually able to present the conference and the gist of the presentation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=4856)|
| 1:21:00| was what if you had someone CIT trained to answer the 911 call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=4860)|
| 1:21:05| So you have a dispatcher that's trained in CIT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=4865)|
| 1:21:09| You have the police who respond who are trained in CIT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=4869)|
| 1:21:12| You have AMR who responds who's trained in CIT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=4872)|
| 1:21:15| And then when you get them to the hospital, you have the nursing staff and you actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=4875)|
| 1:21:19| have the security.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=4879)|
| 1:21:21| Everybody's speaking the same language.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=4881)|
| 1:21:23| Everybody's working with the same de-escalation and verbal skills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=4883)|
| 1:21:26| We're all on the same page because what we would see sometimes is we would have one of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=4886)|
| 1:21:30| those parties interact with a consumer, de-escalate the situation, then you would have someone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=4890)|
| 1:21:35| who was not CIT trained come to the scene and it would actually kind of start to fall| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=4895)|
| 1:21:40| apart because we weren't on the same page about how to address the consumers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=4900)|
| 1:21:45| So CIT is really a community approach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=4905)|
| 1:21:48| It's a multi-agency approach and it's all about the partnerships and how we work together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=4908)|
| 1:21:52| So that's what we do here at KPD.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=4912)|
| 1:21:55| Like I said, all of our officers went through in-service and got the core curriculum, the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=4915)|
| 1:21:59| three-day curriculum in 2018.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=4919)|
| 1:22:01| All of our current recruit classes get the core curriculum when they go through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=4921)|
| 1:22:07| And then officers can then apply to join the actual CIT team once they're out of the academy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=4927)|
| 1:22:13| which is the full 40-hour course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=4933)|
| 1:22:16| And we usually do two of those schools in a given calendar year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=4936)|
| 1:22:20| So that's something if an officer chooses to receive that additional training for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=4940)|
| 1:22:24| 40 hours, then they can do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=4944)|
| 1:22:28| So that's the down and dirty on CIT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=4948)|
| 1:22:30| So questions, because I'm sure there's a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=4950)|
| 1:22:36| Thank you, Councilwoman Schen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=4956)|
| 1:22:37| Appreciate it, Dan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=4957)|
| 1:22:38| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=4958)|
| 1:22:39| Is there an incentive or reward for officers to become part of the CIT team?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=4959)|
| 1:22:44| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=4964)|
| 1:22:45| So I-| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=4965)|
| 1:22:46| You get a cool pin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=4966)|
| 1:22:47| You do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=4967)|
| 1:22:48| You get a CIT pin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=4968)|
| 1:22:49| But no, there's no additional pay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=4969)|
| 1:22:52| There's no incentive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=4972)|
| 1:22:53| It's like all of our special teams, people do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=4973)|
| 1:22:57| And on their own time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=4977)|
| 1:22:58| When I teach, I don't do that full time, even though I am considered the point here for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=4978)|
| 1:23:03| KPD.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=4983)|
| 1:23:04| So when I teach a class, it's a week long that the department has said, hey, we value| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=4984)|
| 1:23:08| this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=4988)|
| 1:23:09| We're going to let you go not do your regular patrol duties, but you're going to go and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=4989)|
| 1:23:13| teach CIT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=4993)|
| 1:23:15| So we don't do it full time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=4995)|
| 1:23:17| As far as being a team, that's all that we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=4997)|
| 1:23:21| So we're still patrol officers, we're still in CID, we're still in multiple different| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=5001)|
| 1:23:25| positions in the department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=5005)|
| 1:23:26| But no, there's no actual incentive for doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=5006)|
| 1:23:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=5010)|
| 1:23:42| Yeah, so first of all, I think it's a great program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=5022)|
| 1:23:46| So excited y'all are doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=5026)|
| 1:23:49| And I'm just curious, and I know, and I may be wrong, and I'm not sure how long the CIT| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=5029)|
| 1:23:56| has actually been in effect, as far as having these classes, but with anything, certification,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=5036)|
| 1:24:02| if you will, like this, is there a plan from a curriculum standpoint to institute kind| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=5042)|
| 1:24:09| of like continuing education, and once somebody's gone through it, maybe once a year, etc.,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=5049)|
| 1:24:15| that there's some extenuation of that curriculum?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=5055)|
| 1:24:19| Yeah, so we do have, actually for in-service this year, we're doing an additional brief,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=5059)|
| 1:24:28| if you will, going over some of those points again, as kind of a refresher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=5068)|
| 1:24:34| Anytime we get new information, like after one of the conferences, we integrate that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=5074)|
| 1:24:39| into our training for officers as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=5079)|
| 1:24:41| And we can put that out through in-service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=5081)|
| 1:24:44| But yeah, there's no refresher school, if you will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=5084)|
| 1:24:48| It's just information that we put out, whether it's through PowerDMS or we're in-service| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=5088)|
| 1:24:53| to keep officers up to date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=5093)|
| 1:24:57| Great, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=5097)|
| 1:25:01| Councilman Thomas?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=5101)|
| 1:25:02| Yes, I had a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=5102)|
| 1:25:04| This has been a very helpful workshop, by the way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=5104)|
| 1:25:07| In regard to the CIT training, is there any advantages and disadvantages in requiring| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=5107)|
| 1:25:13| all the officers to have it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=5113)|
| 1:25:16| So we require all the officers to have the core curriculum, which is the basic verbal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=5116)|
| 1:25:21| skills, which comprise a lot of active listening skills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=5121)|
| 1:25:24| So it's about using your active listening, showing empathy, gaining rapport, and then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=5124)|
| 1:25:29| hopefully gaining influence over an individual to end up having a voluntary compliance or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=5129)|
| 1:25:35| a peaceful outcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=5135)|
| 1:25:36| That's what we want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=5136)|
| 1:25:37| So we think, obviously, all officers need to be trained in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=5137)|
| 1:25:41| So they get the basic verbal skills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=5141)|
| 1:25:43| They get the de-escalation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=5143)|
| 1:25:44| Again, we use on every call that we go to, which is why officers are trained in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=5144)|
| 1:25:49| And then safety considerations as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=5149)|
| 1:25:51| So all of that is taught in the core curriculum, as well as mental health signs and symptoms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=5151)|
| 1:25:58| And then, of course, the state law and our general orders that apply when dealing with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=5158)|
| 1:26:02| someone with mental illness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=5162)|
| 1:26:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=5163)|
| 1:26:04| But the CIT, is it a certification that kind of goes beyond the training that you just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=5164)|
| 1:26:11| described?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=5171)|
| 1:26:12| So the 40-hour course, then they become an actual CIT officer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=5172)|
| 1:26:16| And so dispatch, when they're dispatching a call, can say, can a CIT officer respond| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=5176)|
| 1:26:22| to this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=5182)|
| 1:26:23| And so that's when a CIT officer who's been through the 40-hour course would actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=5183)|
| 1:26:28| go to a call, as opposed to someone who's just been through the core curriculum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=5188)|
| 1:26:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=5191)|
| 1:26:33| I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=5193)|
| 1:26:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=5194)|
| 1:26:43| So the CIT program, the 40-hour training, how long have we been doing that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=5203)|
| 1:26:50| And is that modeled after somebody else's program?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=5210)|
| 1:26:55| Is there kind of a national standard?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=5215)|
| 1:26:59| Like how is our program modeled?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=5219)|
| 1:27:01| So, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=5221)|
| 1:27:02| So since 2012, that's when we started the full 40-hour course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=5222)|
| 1:27:06| So we've been doing that since 2012.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=5226)|
| 1:27:08| We base it on the Memphis model, and that's why I keep saying core curriculum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=5228)|
| 1:27:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=5232)|
| 1:27:13| We develop based on issues that we see here in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=5233)|
| 1:27:17| We adapt the other hours of the 40-hour training to address issues that we are currently seeing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=5237)|
| 1:27:23| So, for example, we actually, we teach, we have someone from the University of Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=5243)|
| 1:27:31| College of Pharmacy who comes and teaches psychopharmacology.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=5251)|
| 1:27:34| So when we run into people who have medication on the streets, our officers may be able to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=5254)|
| 1:27:40| kind of identify the medicine that they're seeing and may have an idea of what they might| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=5260)|
| 1:27:44| be dealing with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=5264)|
| 1:27:46| Same thing with, we do a full day, minus COVID, we do a full day of what we call field trips.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=5266)|
| 1:27:53| So they actually go, they tour CARM, they tour the VMC, we actually take them to Peninsula| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=5273)|
| 1:27:59| Hospital, and so that takes up an entire day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=5279)|
| 1:28:03| We actually have started doing lunch like at Friendship House, where we actually sit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=5283)|
| 1:28:07| down and do lunch with consumers in the community, and we talk to them about their encounters| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=5287)|
| 1:28:11| with police in the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=5291)|
| 1:28:13| So that takes up a whole day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=5293)|
| 1:28:15| So the core curriculum is based on the Memphis model.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=5295)|
| 1:28:18| It's what you'll see across the country and internationally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=5298)|
| 1:28:20| The international conference, you have individuals from China, Canada, all over the world.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=5300)|
| 1:28:26| And so we all speak the same language as far as the core curriculum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=5306)|
| 1:28:29| It's when we get outside of that, that we actually address issues that we see here and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=5309)|
| 1:28:33| Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=5313)|
| 1:28:35| Does that answer your question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=5315)|
| 1:28:37| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=5317)|
| 1:28:39| And just one last thing to tack on, to tag on to Councilman Smith's question about what's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=5319)|
| 1:28:43| the incentive for doing the CIT training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=5323)|
| 1:28:46| So my understanding, obviously officers start with KPD, and they do their training, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=5326)|
| 1:28:53| I've never been in a profession that was, well, I guess it's probably not true, that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=5333)|
| 1:28:57| was rank-oriented the way that you guys are organized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=5337)|
| 1:29:02| But if someone wants promotion, there may not be a pay incentive to do it, but officers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=5342)|
| 1:29:08| are encouraged to do different things, and that might contribute to promotion or other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=5348)|
| 1:29:12| things, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=5352)|
| 1:29:13| I mean, there are incentives for doing it in that fashion, maybe?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=5353)|
| 1:29:18| Could be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=5358)|
| 1:29:20| No?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=5360)|
| 1:29:21| We look at special units during promotion times and how much, you know, if you're an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=5361)|
| 1:29:26| instructor in something, there's a lot of things, extra responsibilities that you take| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=5366)|
| 1:29:32| on or look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=5372)|
| 1:29:33| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=5373)|
| 1:29:34| Like an officer may not do the CIT training, but they may do something else, like they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=5374)|
| 1:29:38| may do the Neighborhood Liaison Program or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=5378)|
| 1:29:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=5381)|
| 1:29:49| We have no audio.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=5389)|
| 1:29:51| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=5391)|
| 1:29:52| You're mic'd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=5392)|
| 1:29:53| Oh, I didn't unmute myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=5393)|
| 1:29:55| I'm excited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=5395)|
| 1:29:56| I got called on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=5396)|
| 1:29:58| So do you have, how many people can you do train a year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=5398)|
| 1:30:05| Are there more people that would like to be trained with the 40-hour course than we can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=5405)|
| 1:30:12| handle?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=5412)|
| 1:30:13| And then the other question would be, it's not a question, it's a statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=5413)|
| 1:30:18| I would encourage KPD to look at becoming CIT certified as something that was rewarded| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=5418)|
| 1:30:31| in the promotion considerations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=5431)|
| 1:30:35| Because if we really want de-escalation and we really want this to work, incentivizing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=5435)|
| 1:30:45| people to get trained about something that we all want to happen is a pretty good idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=5445)|
| 1:30:53| You know, it's a carrot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=5453)|
| 1:30:56| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=5456)|
| 1:30:57| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=5457)|
| 1:30:58| And so the answer to your question are yes and yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=5458)|
| 1:31:03| So class size capacity, I will address first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=5463)|
| 1:31:06| We do pretty in-depth, we do scenarios and they cover about two and a half days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=5466)|
| 1:31:11| We try to keep our classes to around 20 to 25 individuals just so we can have that quality| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=5471)|
| 1:31:17| scenario time at the end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=5477)|
| 1:31:19| If you have more than 25 people, it gets a little bit hectic and I feel like we can't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=5479)|
| 1:31:23| deliver quality.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=5483)|
| 1:31:25| Again, because this isn't our full-time job, we put on two classes per year, roughly, not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=5485)|
| 1:31:31| county recruits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=5491)|
| 1:31:33| And so yes, we have agencies outside of KPD.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=5493)|
| 1:31:36| Alcoa is constantly asking to send people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=5496)|
| 1:31:38| The hospitals are asking, UT police are asking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=5498)|
| 1:31:41| So we have to go through and carefully do our numbers and say we're going to select| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=5501)|
| 1:31:46| this many from this agency, this many from this agency, and so on and so forth every| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=5506)|
| 1:31:50| time we have a training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=5510)|
| 1:31:52| But yes, because one of the things that CIT does and we're trying, I think Alcoa has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=5512)|
| 1:31:56| recently started it, we're trying to do train-the-trainer where these other agencies can create their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=5516)|
| 1:32:01| own CIT programs in their communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=5521)|
| 1:32:05| And so that will help us continue to focus on training those in Knox County that work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=5525)|
| 1:32:10| most closely with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=5530)|
| 1:32:12| And so like I said, Alcoa has now started their own CIT program and we're helping them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=5532)|
| 1:32:16| kind of get that started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=5536)|
| 1:32:18| And so they can take on training people in Blount County and using the resources and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=5538)|
| 1:32:22| teaching about the resources in Blount County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=5542)|
| 1:32:24| But yes, we have a huge interest in the CIT program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=5544)|
| 1:32:28| So the part of what I hear here is that other agencies are taking up seats for our officers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=5548)|
| 1:32:37| if we wanted to, if we were having the limit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=5557)|
| 1:32:43| I'm sorry, I couldn't understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=5563)|
| 1:32:45| It sounds like every time you train someone in another agency, they're taking up seats| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=5565)|
| 1:32:50| that a KPD officer couldn't train.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=5570)|
| 1:32:56| So I get the train-the-trainer, but...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=5576)|
| 1:32:59| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=5579)|
| 1:33:00| And I will say we, between us and KCSO, because we're the two agencies that are usually putting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=5580)|
| 1:33:05| on the training, we have the vast majority of those seats.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=5585)|
| 1:33:08| So when I take people from Alcoa or UTPD, they usually only have one or two seats at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=5588)|
| 1:33:13| these trainings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=5593)|
| 1:33:14| So it's still overwhelmingly KPD and KCSO.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=5594)|
| 1:33:17| I'm sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=5597)|
| 1:33:19| But that's two or three more seats.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=5599)|
| 1:33:21| Yes, sure, sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=5601)|
| 1:33:23| But you're answering my question that we have people who are interested in this, which I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=5603)|
| 1:33:30| find very encouraging.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=5610)|
| 1:33:31| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=5611)|
| 1:33:32| That our officers are interested in this and not adverse to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=5612)|
| 1:33:37| I find that encouraging.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=5617)|
| 1:33:38| I think they find it beneficial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=5618)|
| 1:33:39| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=5619)|
| 1:33:40| Of course, it would be helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=5620)|
| 1:33:42| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=5622)|
| 1:33:43| Very helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=5623)|

| 1:33:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=5633)|
| 1:33:54| I was just going to mention that NAMI, that's behind CIT, is also one of the large groups| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=5634)|
| 1:33:59| behind 988.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=5639)|
| 1:34:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=5641)|
| 1:34:02| And NAMI does sit at our regional board, so I'll be sure to ask them about that at our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=5642)|
| 1:34:06| next meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=5646)|
| 1:34:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=5647)|
| 1:34:08| Great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=5648)|
| 1:34:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=5649)|
| 1:34:12| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=5652)|
| 1:34:17| Anybody else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=5657)|
| 1:34:18| Oh, it's over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=5658)|
| 1:34:19| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=5659)|
| 1:34:20| That's appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=5660)|
| 1:34:21| Thank you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=5661)|
| 1:34:22| First of all, thank you, Council, for allowing me to participate in this workshop and hearing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=5662)|
| 1:34:28| all this great information, and to KPD for sharing this information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=5668)|
| 1:34:33| But I did have just a couple of questions about the CIT program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=5673)|
| 1:34:39| I know that it was mentioned that all of the CI certified officers are, this is just kind| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=5679)|
| 1:34:50| of an additional, and they still have their normal duties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=5690)|
| 1:34:52| If you all know about, on average, about how many CI certified officers are available on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=5692)|
| 1:35:01| each shift, if there are calls that are coming in where it seems like a CI certified officer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=5701)|
| 1:35:07| may be a better response, how many would be available per shift to respond to those?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=5707)|
| 1:35:14| And I know it was also mentioned about trying to coordinate the training across departments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=5714)|
| 1:35:22| and agencies so that everyone's speaking the same language.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=5722)|
| 1:35:25| And we talked quite a bit in the last session, the last training portion, about how important| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=5725)|
| 1:35:31| the dispatchers are in terms of fielding these calls and assessing what the response needs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=5731)|
| 1:35:38| to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=5738)|
| 1:35:39| All of the 911 dispatchers receive at least some level of CI training so that they are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=5739)|
| 1:35:45| cognizant of what they may be hearing and listening to and can assess who needs to properly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=5745)|
| 1:35:51| respond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=5751)|
| 1:35:52| So I'll address, you want to address that first or the first part?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=5752)|
| 1:35:55| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=5755)|
| 1:35:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=5756)|
| 1:35:57| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=5757)|
| 1:35:58| So I'll address the first question you had about how many officers per shift.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=5758)|
| 1:36:00| I have not done that breakdown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=5760)|
| 1:36:02| Our patrol squad, we move people pretty frequently, so I can't give you a number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=5762)|
| 1:36:08| My latest numbers show that we have 39 CIP certified officers on patrol right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=5768)|
| 1:36:14| So out of all of our shifts at KPD, 39 officers have actually gone through the 40-hour certified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=5774)|
| 1:36:20| That's not counting the people who have gone through it during the recruit training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=5780)|
| 1:36:26| So some of our recruit academies have actually had the full 40-hour course, they just haven't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=5786)|
| 1:36:30| been certified because they haven't been through it as an officer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=5790)|
| 1:36:33| So that number is much higher for people who have received the core training during the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=5793)|
| 1:36:38| academy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=5798)|
| 1:36:39| But as far as the 40-hour course that we put on where they become CIP certified, currently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=5799)|
| 1:36:45| we have 39 officers on patrol who are CIT officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=5805)|
| 1:36:49| Does that answer your first question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=5809)|
| 1:36:51| And I'll let him address the second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=5811)|
| 1:36:53| There's six patrol squads, to give you an idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=5813)|
| 1:36:55| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=5815)|
| 1:36:56| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=5816)|
| 1:36:57| So those 39 officers are split amongst six squads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=5817)|
| 1:37:03| So for the part of the 9-1-1 employees training, I can't speak to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=5823)|
| 1:37:08| Ironically enough, I had made in my own notes to compare based on our discussions this afternoon,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=5828)|
| 1:37:14| and we're talking about these calls and the codings especially, to compare what we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=5834)|
| 1:37:19| training our officers versus what training that the call takers and dispatchers do have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=5839)|
| 1:37:24| So we're kind of thinking down the same path there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=5844)|
| 1:37:26| So that's one of the follow-ups that I'm going to have with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=5846)|
| 1:37:28| While I don't know what's in their basic training, we offer them in-service on a regular| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=5848)|
| 1:37:33| They have a morning or an afternoon roll call time, and we're often invited in to provide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=5853)|
| 1:37:37| training with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=5857)|
| 1:37:38| And this is definitely one of those places we can have that interaction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=5858)|
| 1:37:41| So I'll get back with you on that because I want to find out myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=5861)|
| 1:37:44| And they're not our employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=5864)|
| 1:37:46| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=5866)|
| 1:37:47| They're not our employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=5867)|
| 1:37:48| That's a separate entity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=5868)|
| 1:37:49| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=5869)|
| 1:37:50| Well, I heard in Sergeant Britt's discussion about the presentation that you all gave,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=5870)|
| 1:37:55| the discussion about making sure that across interacting agencies, you all were speaking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=5875)|
| 1:38:01| the same language.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=5881)|
| 1:38:02| I didn't know if you all had information on what those agencies were doing to make sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=5882)|
| 1:38:06| that that is actually what's happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=5886)|
| 1:38:08| And I probably didn't clarify.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=5888)|
| 1:38:09| When I said dispatchers, we trained UTPD dispatchers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=5889)|
| 1:38:12| So those are the dispatchers who have actually come to the actual CIT courts, not the Knox| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=5892)|
| 1:38:19| County 911 dispatchers that he's been talking about in the calls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=5899)|
| 1:38:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=5904)|
| 1:38:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=5905)|
| 1:38:32| So can I ask a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=5912)|
| 1:38:35| I guess this is all really obtuse when we talk about things in numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=5915)|
| 1:38:39| And if you can't answer this question now, maybe mull it over because we're going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=5919)|
| 1:38:45| have more sessions and have more conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=5925)|
| 1:38:48| I'm curious and would like an example of you guys run three shifts, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=5928)|
| 1:38:54| For KPD.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=5934)|
| 1:38:55| And so you have 39 of these certified officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=5935)|
| 1:39:00| Shift one, shift two, shift three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=5940)|
| 1:39:04| I'm kind of wondering how that would be into play.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=5944)|
| 1:39:08| Like if there's 10 officers on a shift that have that training, how might that come into| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=5948)|
| 1:39:14| play?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=5954)|
| 1:39:15| A scenario maybe of, you know, how that's a benefit based on somebody going out to a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=5955)|
| 1:39:22| call and is the CIT trained person somebody that might be the initial response officer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=5962)|
| 1:39:29| or might they be somebody that's called in for backup?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=5969)|
| 1:39:32| A lot of it is dependent on the call screen that we get.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=5972)|
| 1:39:38| I know back when I ran calls for service six months ago, when we would get a call that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=5978)|
| 1:39:46| was a suicidal person or someone having some sort of crisis, CIT officers, if they're available,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=5986)|
| 1:39:52| naturally go to those calls themselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=5992)|
| 1:39:55| So they may cancel another officer and take that call or they may go with backup.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=5995)|
| 1:39:59| But that's part of being a CIT officer is you're constantly listening for those calls| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=5999)|
| 1:40:04| for service because you have a desire to do so and you want to be one of the ones to show| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=6004)|
| 1:40:08| up and to try to de-escalate and bring about a peaceful outcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=6008)|
| 1:40:13| So a lot of officers are self-motivated and are listening to the radio and when a call| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=6013)|
| 1:40:17| comes out that sounds like it may be related to something, crisis or mental health, they're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=6017)|
| 1:40:23| going to that on their own accord if they're not dispatched to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=6023)|
| 1:40:25| And then sometimes actually in the community, because the community is becoming more aware| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=6025)|
| 1:40:29| of the CIT program, they will request a CIT officer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=6029)|
| 1:40:32| And so dispatch has the worksheets every day for who is working and the special teams or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=6032)|
| 1:40:39| the units that officers are a part of are on that worksheet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=6039)|
| 1:40:43| So they can look and see which officers have had the CIT training and they can actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=6043)|
| 1:40:48| dispatch those officers to those calls if they're available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=6048)|
| 1:40:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=6051)|
| 1:40:53| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=6053)|
| 1:40:59| Councilman Romano?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=6059)|
| 1:41:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=6062)|
| 1:41:04| Thinking about the coding and then also the responses from the CIT, do you keep track| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=6064)|
| 1:41:15| of the amount of calls where there was an escalation or a de-escalation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=6075)|
| 1:41:22| Is there a way of tracking that so that you can see how effective some of the methods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=6082)|
| 1:41:29| you're using are being?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=6089)|
| 1:41:31| I mean, is there a record of that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=6091)|
| 1:41:34| Is there a recoding of that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=6094)|
| 1:41:36| From a coding standpoint, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=6096)|
| 1:41:38| But I think, I don't know if you all have anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=6098)|
| 1:41:41| So we do what's called a mental health tracking form.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=6101)|
| 1:41:44| That's a separate form aside from the Watson program where we document or are supposed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=6104)|
| 1:41:48| to document any encounters we have with someone who is experiencing a mental health crisis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=6108)|
| 1:41:53| Again, there's HIPAA considerations there because if we start filling out forms on people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=6113)|
| 1:41:59| who are experiencing some sort of mental health issue, that's public record if we do that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=6119)|
| 1:42:04| within a Watson system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=6124)|
| 1:42:06| So we do internally do the mental health tracking forms anytime we come into contact with someone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=6126)|
| 1:42:11| who has a mental illness, but as far as tracking de-escalation or escalation, these forms are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=6131)|
| 1:42:17| just more for our knowledge of who in the community may need additional resources than| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=6137)|
| 1:42:23| just the police department can provide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=6143)|
| 1:42:26| So there's no actual tracking of escalation, de-escalation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=6146)|
| 1:42:31| I know having spoke to people at Helen Ross McNabb, especially those in the CSU, they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=6151)|
| 1:42:35| told us since implementing CIT, officers get called to the CSU sometimes for disturbances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=6155)|
| 1:42:40| and they say they can automatically tell if an officer's had CIT training because they're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=6160)|
| 1:42:45| much more likely to be able to de-escalate someone on the scene and have a good outcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=6165)|
| 1:42:49| So as far as data, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=6169)|
| 1:42:51| As far as feedback from others in the community who've had encounters, they say that it is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=6171)|
| 1:42:56| effective and they see a difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=6176)|
| 1:42:59| Would it be helpful to have some kind of, you know, attempt at objective, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=6179)|
| 1:43:05| measures like that so you could, you know, look at the data and use that to drive, you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=6185)|
| 1:43:13| know, more lengthy courses or, you know, different, you know, techniques that were used in one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=6193)|
| 1:43:23| situation but maybe not another that seemed to be, you know, more successful?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=6203)|
| 1:43:31| I think that's pretty, I think that's pretty subjective to each officer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=6211)|
| 1:43:35| I don't know that there is an accurate way for us to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=6215)|
| 1:43:42| As I become, and I've heard this on the radio myself, as we become more and more familiar| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=6222)|
| 1:43:47| with our community, there are some officers, even within the CIT trained officers, who| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=6227)|
| 1:43:52| are better with certain people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=6232)|
| 1:43:54| So as they develop relationships with certain people, they will ask or they will say I've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=6234)|
| 1:43:58| dealt with this person before, I will go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=6238)|
| 1:44:01| So that's more of a, and like I said, once we start, we can't really track that kind| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=6241)|
| 1:44:06| of information because we're getting into HIPAA issues and we're probably not a whole| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=6246)|
| 1:44:10| lot supposed to be keeping our database so we don't talk about it a whole lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=6250)|
| 1:44:15| And when she mentioned Watson, that's actually our records management system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=6255)|
| 1:44:19| So we don't want to put that in a records management system as an official document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=6259)|
| 1:44:25| So as far as this person's better to de-escalate, that's more of a, probably a experiential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=6265)|
| 1:44:32| you know, as we work with the same people every day so we know which officer deals with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=6272)|
| 1:44:37| what kind of situations better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=6277)|
| 1:44:39| Like when I had a B partner and I knew what triggered him, he knew what triggered me so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=6279)|
| 1:44:42| we were able to help each other through calls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=6282)|
| 1:44:44| As we work with each other, we know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=6284)|
| 1:44:46| So same thing as an officer who responds to a certain person who has mental health issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=6286)|
| 1:44:50| the next time that address comes up, that officer may say I've dealt with this person| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=6290)|
| 1:44:54| before, I've done really well, or they didn't respond to me, maybe somebody else needs to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=6294)|
| 1:44:58| go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=6298)|
| 1:44:59| Because even though you're CIT trained, the rapport can be different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=6299)|
| 1:45:02| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=6302)|
| 1:45:03| And I will say the patrol supervisor, there are certain CIT officers on my own squad,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=6303)|
| 1:45:07| if I hear a call come out, I'll generally try to go to most of those myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=6307)|
| 1:45:12| If I'm available to do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=6312)|
| 1:45:14| But there are certain CIT officers that I will call and say, hey, can you start heading| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=6314)|
| 1:45:18| to that call?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=6318)|
| 1:45:19| If they're not already, and usually they're saying I'm already on my way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=6319)|
| 1:45:21| But it's also patrol supervisors who know their guys and they're saying, hey, can you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=6321)|
| 1:45:26| see me over here, can you go to that call?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=6326)|
| 1:45:28| I think you'd be an asset.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=6328)|
| 1:45:30| So there's that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=6330)|
| 1:45:31| But as far as, as far as documenting which de-escalation attempts work or don't work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=6331)|
| 1:45:37| I think that would be pretty difficult to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=6337)|
| 1:45:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=6340)|
| 1:45:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=6341)|
| 1:45:47| So kind of piggybacking off what Councilmember Roberto said and has been brought up, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=6347)|
| 1:45:54| this may actually be more in line with discussion down the road as far as training, etc.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=6354)|
| 1:46:00| But in my conversations with Chief Thomas in the past, there has been the conversation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=6360)|
| 1:46:06| or talking about de-escalation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=6366)|
| 1:46:09| And in 2019, that those stats or the ability for us to de-escalate situations that essentially| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=6369)|
| 1:46:21| was translated as it's working in different de-escalation tactics that we're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=6381)|
| 1:46:31| So I don't know if it's piggybacking or if it's something we need to talk about down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=6391)|
| 1:46:35| the road, but I just, can you talk a little bit more about that and how the stats are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=6395)|
| 1:46:42| showing that our de-escalation training is in fact effective?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=6402)|
| 1:46:45| Yes, let me give you a stat that's out there that's a really good one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=6405)|
| 1:46:50| And it's not officially out yet, but I do know that the numbers, I can't give you the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=6410)|
| 1:46:55| exact numbers, maybe I have it here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=6415)|
| 1:46:57| Our use of force annual analysis is getting ready to come out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=6417)|
| 1:47:02| So in 2018, we documented 171 times using force, laying hands on somebody, where we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=6422)|
| 1:47:09| actually had to do more than directionally control them, no matter what that force was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=6429)|
| 1:47:15| In 2019, for the whole year, we had 122.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=6435)|
| 1:47:19| And this includes K-9 reports.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=6439)|
| 1:47:21| We've deployed a K-9 that's a use of force.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=6441)|
| 1:47:23| So we have gone down in our use of force 28% from 2018 to 2019.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=6443)|
| 1:47:29| So, and Lieutenant Schaefer can tell you this, de-escalation has become kind of buzzword| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=6449)|
| 1:47:34| like community-oriented policing, but we teach that in every call, in every scenario we talk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=6454)|
| 1:47:40| about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=6460)|
| 1:47:41| That's part of what we do because we don't want to have to use force.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=6461)|
| 1:47:43| We don't want to lay hands on somebody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=6463)|
| 1:47:45| It's dangerous for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=6465)|
| 1:47:46| It's dangerous for the other person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=6466)|
| 1:47:48| So it's not just a class.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=6468)|
| 1:47:50| It's taught through everything we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=6470)|
| 1:47:53| We want to be more verbal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=6473)|
| 1:47:54| We want to use active listening so we can hear those cues of what's going to set somebody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=6474)|
| 1:47:58| off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=6478)|
| 1:47:59| So we don't say something that's going to set them off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=6479)|
| 1:48:01| Or can we back off a little bit and calm things down so we don't have to lay hands on somebody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=6481)|
| 1:48:05| So correct me if I'm wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=6485)|
| 1:48:07| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=6487)|
| 1:48:08| With each of, especially when we get into our use of force training, whether that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=6488)|
| 1:48:13| hands or that's our taser or our spray and even up to the firearms, we teach them that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=6493)|
| 1:48:20| there are steps when the situation will allow to try beforehand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=6500)|
| 1:48:24| And everything we do, we kind of alluded to that earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=6504)|
| 1:48:28| We don't do everything together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=6508)|
| 1:48:29| We just don't have a class, check that box, move to the next class, check that box.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=6509)|
| 1:48:33| We begin to build through their academy and keep bringing those things back in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=6513)|
| 1:48:38| So I think you'll see that that training and that method of training is starting to work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=6518)|
| 1:48:42| Because that's a huge draw for us, 20% a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=6522)|
| 1:48:45| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=6525)|
| 1:48:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=6526)|
| 1:48:47| That's what I wanted to, that's what I was looking for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=6527)|
| 1:48:50| One last one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=6530)|
| 1:48:56| Ms. Roddick?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=6536)|
| 1:48:57| So I actually have a question about some of the stuff in the previous part of the presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=6537)|
| 1:49:04| Like, there's the co-response team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=6544)|
| 1:49:07| That is going to be on the agenda for next, this coming Tuesday?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=6547)|
| 1:49:12| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=6552)|
| 1:49:13| This coming Tuesday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=6553)|
| 1:49:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=6554)|
| 1:49:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=6555)|
| 1:49:16| Which I just looked and it's not loaded in our portal yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=6556)|
| 1:49:19| I don't have the packet to look at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=6559)|
| 1:49:20| Is that, I don't want to make people stay longer tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=6560)|
| 1:49:23| I guess my question is, is that something we should talk about now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=6563)|
| 1:49:28| Or are we going to talk about it on Tuesday?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=6568)|
| 1:49:31| So that will be behavioral health staff paired with KPD CIT officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=6571)|
| 1:49:38| There's the four days per week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=6578)|
| 1:49:41| I guess, is that based on, how many people are we talking about?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=6581)|
| 1:49:46| What exactly, what's the volume of this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=6586)|
| 1:49:48| It's a pilot program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=6588)|
| 1:49:49| It's a pilot program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=6589)|
| 1:49:50| It involves one master's level person that is available to us on a full-time basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=6590)|
| 1:49:55| Have we not approved something like this in the past?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=6595)|
| 1:49:58| Or was that just for the grant programs where there were the Helen Ross McNabb social workers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=6598)|
| 1:50:03| that went out and helped with the prostitution intervention?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=6603)|
| 1:50:08| Is that what this is based on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=6608)|
| 1:50:10| Yes, exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=6610)|
| 1:50:11| We're just moving it over to mental health.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=6611)|
| 1:50:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=6614)|
| 1:50:16| That program expired, and so we thought, can we do this with mental health?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=6616)|
| 1:50:19| Let's look for some money to be able to do this with mental health.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=6619)|
| 1:50:22| So yes, that's exactly what it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=6622)|
| 1:50:24| And they'll help develop some curriculum for dealing with mental health issues as well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=6624)|
| 1:50:28| that they can help us with recognizing things like this from them being in the field with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=6628)|
| 1:50:33| So we're really hoping, we're not sure what it's going to, we're sure what we want to do with it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=6633)|
| 1:50:38| but it may develop and evolve as we move through as to what training they see that we need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=6638)|
| 1:50:43| Or maybe we're doing some things right, some things wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=6643)|
| 1:50:45| Maybe there's some calls that they see that we don't need to respond to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=6645)|
| 1:50:48| and we can call somebody else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=6648)|
| 1:50:50| So we're hoping, it's a pilot program, and we're really hoping to get a lot out of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=6650)|
| 1:50:54| And we don't want to put parameters on it at this point too much| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=6654)|
| 1:50:57| because we want to see where it goes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=6657)|
| 1:51:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=6660)|
| 1:51:01| That's not a bad answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=6661)|
| 1:51:03| So one of the things I looked at briefly is like Houston has a program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=6663)|
| 1:51:09| where they had 21 social workers that they paired with officers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=6669)|
| 1:51:13| and they were in the same car.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=6673)|
| 1:51:15| So it's kind of that model where they're paired together like a team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=6675)|
| 1:51:18| And I guess, is the four days per week just based on finances?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=6678)|
| 1:51:22| Is there something magic about four days per week?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=6682)|
| 1:51:25| I want to caveat that a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=6685)|
| 1:51:27| I think, first of all, the contract is kind of evolving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=6687)|
| 1:51:30| But the idea here is that there's an embedded team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=6690)|
| 1:51:33| So in other words, if the officer, if that KPD officer is on the street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=6693)|
| 1:51:37| that's the social worker professional with that same officer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=6697)|
| 1:51:40| So I think, Chief, you run four-day shifts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=6700)|
| 1:51:43| Correct me if I'm wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=6703)|
| 1:51:44| But in essence, that would essentially fluctuate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=6704)|
| 1:51:46| so that they are a matched team whenever they're on shift.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=6706)|
| 1:51:51| Our shifts are four days a week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=6711)|
| 1:51:54| They're four 10-hour days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=6714)|
| 1:51:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=6715)|
| 1:51:56| I've got a little bit of a timeline that is the pilot idea for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=6716)|
| 1:52:03| So there's a phase one going through September.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=6723)|
| 1:52:06| The hiring of the mental health behavior staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=6726)|
| 1:52:10| the staff person that they're going to use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=6730)|
| 1:52:12| Orientation, of course, in the KPD.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=6732)|
| 1:52:15| Developing policies and procedures for this program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=6735)|
| 1:52:18| will be hopefully through September.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=6738)|
| 1:52:21| Identifying what data elements, data elements they're going to collect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=6741)|
| 1:52:25| Reviewing current mental health and addiction frames that we offer now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=6745)|
| 1:52:28| And then the second phase is October through December.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=6748)|
| 1:52:32| And that's where they actually implement the co-response team| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=6752)|
| 1:52:35| and implement evaluating that program and collection of data| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=6755)|
| 1:52:38| as they're going along.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=6758)|
| 1:52:39| And January through June, they'll implement new training recommendations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=6759)|
| 1:52:43| and evaluate data for effective outcomes and making more adjustments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=6763)|
| 1:52:47| So we've got kind of a timeline response.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=6767)|
| 1:52:50| It's really basic because, again, we don't want to have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=6770)|
| 1:52:55| any preconceived notions of what this will become.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=6775)|
| 1:52:58| We want to see what our community needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=6778)|
| 1:53:01| We can look at what other communities are doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=6781)|
| 1:53:03| We've looked at CAHOOTS.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=6783)|
| 1:53:05| I haven't looked at Houston, but some of these other things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=6785)|
| 1:53:08| And CAHOOTS has been around 40 years, 50 years now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=6788)|
| 1:53:11| And they've developed their own clientele.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=6791)|
| 1:53:13| So it's not something we can step in and do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=6793)|
| 1:53:16| So what we want to do is something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=6796)|
| 1:53:18| We want to identify a program that will work specifically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=6798)|
| 1:53:20| for the Knoxville community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=6800)|
| 1:53:22| And I think this is probably a good way to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=6802)|
| 1:53:24| Try to start out with one person and then see where we need to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=6804)|
| 1:53:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=6809)|
| 1:53:31| But we are already using social workers through the other partners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=6811)|
| 1:53:35| You have UTK, College of Social Work, as one of the partners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=6815)|
| 1:53:40| And whatever SWARPs is, could you touch on what you do with them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=6820)|
| 1:53:47| That's more as we get a grant and we need to evaluate data.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=6827)|
| 1:53:51| It's more of a data evaluation that we'll contract out with them for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=6831)|
| 1:53:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=6835)|
| 1:53:56| So it's not like we're using College of Social Work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=6836)|
| 1:53:58| It's not a response.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=6838)|
| 1:54:00| It's a data analysis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=6840)|
| 1:54:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=6842)|
| 1:54:04| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=6844)|
| 1:54:11| Councilman Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=6851)|
| 1:54:13| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=6853)|
| 1:54:15| This is more of a comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=6855)|
| 1:54:17| This pilot program that we're discussing is something that I think is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=6857)|
| 1:54:19| really promising.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=6859)|
| 1:54:21| You know, I know we're starting out small.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=6861)|
| 1:54:23| Actually, if I had my druthers, we'd start out even a little bit bigger| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=6863)|
| 1:54:28| with maybe more workers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=6868)|
| 1:54:30| But it's something that I think we ought to really take a good look at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=6870)|
| 1:54:34| and as rapidly as we can evaluate how well we're doing with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=6874)|
| 1:54:38| And if it's something that's getting positive results, I would certainly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=6878)|
| 1:54:44| be supportive of expanding it as rapidly as feasible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=6884)|
| 1:54:48| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=6888)|
| 1:54:50| And I really look forward to getting this off the ground.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=6890)|
| 1:54:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=6893)|
| 1:54:55| And to Chief Thomas's point, part of why we want to launch this as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=6895)|
| 1:54:59| quickly as we can is so that we have some of that data and some of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=6899)|
| 1:55:03| that experience as we go into the budgeting process for next year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=6903)|
| 1:55:06| and understanding what some of the expansion opportunities can be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=6906)|
| 1:55:10| both with grant funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=6910)|
| 1:55:12| As Chief Thomas mentioned, we are expecting there might be some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=6912)|
| 1:55:15| opportunities for other dollars to come in, but also looking at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=6915)|
| 1:55:19| whether this could be something that we continue to expand with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=6919)|
| 1:55:22| local funds as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=6922)|
| 1:55:24| And I think it's a very thoughtful way to go about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=6924)|
| 1:55:27| In the experience as a traffic services supervisor, we would throw| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=6927)|
| 1:55:31| manpower at something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=6931)|
| 1:55:33| We're going to put everybody out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=6933)|
| 1:55:35| And if we put five people at a corner to direct traffic during UT| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=6935)|
| 1:55:37| football, we've got to be better at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=6937)|
| 1:55:39| And we started really looking at it and going, wait a second, we need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=6939)|
| 1:55:41| to drop back and just have a couple of officers out and evaluate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=6941)|
| 1:55:43| what we're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=6943)|
| 1:55:45| So I think if we start out with fewer people and then build on that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=6945)|
| 1:55:48| I'm hopeful we'll address the issues more effectively.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=6948)|
| 1:55:54| Wow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=6954)|
| 1:55:56| Anybody else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=6956)|
| 1:55:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=6958)|
| 1:56:00| Do we have any additional questions or comments from council?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=6960)|
| 1:56:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=6968)|
| 1:56:10| Councilwoman Singh?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=6970)|
| 1:56:12| You know I've got to have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=6972)|
| 1:56:14| This is a big question, and I know we all need to think a lot more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=6974)|

| 1:56:25| I wanted your opinion on the way people have been looking at policing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=6985)|

| 1:56:51| Well, you know, one of the things that Chief Keith had the foresight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=7011)|
| 1:56:55| to do was to bring community policing into the police department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=7015)|
| 1:56:59| Not as specific officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=7019)|
| 1:57:01| Some agencies still have community policing officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=7021)|
| 1:57:03| We do it as a philosophy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=7023)|
| 1:57:05| It's part of the way we do business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=7025)|
| 1:57:07| And community policing is all about partnerships and problem solving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=7027)|
| 1:57:09| So when we talk about problem solving, that's exactly what that is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=7029)|
| 1:57:13| It's trying to identify issues on the front end before they become| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=7033)|
| 1:57:15| big issues or before they become a crime.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=7035)|
| 1:57:18| And our liaison officers that work with our communities are able to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=7038)|
| 1:57:22| that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=7042)|
| 1:57:24| Unfortunately, we have been hampered by COVID by not being able to meet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=7044)|
| 1:57:28| with our communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=7048)|
| 1:57:30| And it's, for lack of a better word, it's killing us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=7050)|
| 1:57:32| Because we're not having to have that good communication.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=7052)|
| 1:57:34| We're trying to figure out can we do Zoom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=7054)|
| 1:57:36| I hate Zoom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=7056)|
| 1:57:38| I'll tell you right up front.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=7058)|
| 1:57:40| I do much better in person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=7060)|
| 1:57:42| I can read people better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=7062)|
| 1:57:44| I hate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=7064)|
| 1:57:46| We need to try and do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=7066)|
| 1:57:48| But a lot of our communities that actually meet with us are older.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=7068)|
| 1:57:50| And they're not familiar with technology.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=7070)|
| 1:57:52| And so we're hampered in that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=7072)|
| 1:57:54| And that's one of the issues we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=7074)|
| 1:57:56| How do we appeal to those 20 and 30-somethings?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=7076)|
| 1:57:58| How can we get those folks interested in their community?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=7078)|
| 1:58:00| And we've got to find out how to meet them where they are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=7080)|
| 1:58:02| And social media has been good at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=7082)|
| 1:58:04| But problem solving is a part of community-oriented policing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=7084)|
| 1:58:06| And that's something we work on all the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=7086)|
| 1:58:08| And how can we do better at that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=7088)|
| 1:58:10| So we actually teach other agencies community policing and problem solving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=7090)|
| 1:58:12| But it's not something we're perfect at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=7092)|
| 1:58:14| We've got to keep learning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=7094)|
| 1:58:16| Can you explain to me what that is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=7096)|

| 1:58:22| Community policing is partnerships and problem solving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=7102)|
| 1:58:24| That's the simplest way to put it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=7104)|

| 1:59:04| That's one thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=7144)|

| 1:59:39| have a new person in our personnel unit who came up with a great idea is how to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=7179)|
| 1:59:43| get our backgrounds done without having to use the people who normally do it. We| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=7183)|

| 1:59:50| not and so we that's what we need to do with problem-solving in our community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=7190)|
| 1:59:55| too is we got to listen to those ideas and think outside the box and that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=7195)|
| 1:59:59| what the community meetings are so good at is you know letting the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=7199)|

| 2:00:10| necessarily the police that need to be the ones solving these problems or can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=7210)|
| 2:00:17| it be before it comes to the level of the police? So we want to support the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=7217)|

| 2:00:54| community education as well because does a person with a gun actually need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=7254)|

| 2:01:24| can place the civilian officers more than the person with a gun? I'm assuming| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=7284)|
| 2:01:31| the civilians don't carry guns. So you're asking should we send? I'm saying when we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200723?start=7291)|
