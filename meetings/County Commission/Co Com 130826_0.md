| 0:01:32| Be seated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=92)|

| 0:01:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=95)|
| 0:01:36| Madam Clerk, first item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=96)|
| 0:01:38| Consideration of suspension revocation of the beer permit for the following establishment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=98)|
| 0:01:42| Ebenezer Food Mart, 600 Ebenezer Road, Ebenezer Food Mart, Incorporated, owner, first offense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=102)|
| 0:01:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=108)|
| 0:01:49| Is the owner here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=109)|
| 0:01:50| Please come forward and give your name and address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=110)|
| 0:01:56| Nick Patel, 600 Ebenezer Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=116)|
| 0:02:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=120)|
| 0:02:01| Thank you, Mr. Patel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=121)|
| 0:02:03| Mr. Law Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=123)|
| 0:02:07| Mr. Patel, the procedures here today is that we will have testimony from the allegations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=127)|
| 0:02:15| that are to be brought against you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=135)|
| 0:02:17| The officer will testify before this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=137)|
| 0:02:20| After they are through testifying, you'll have an opportunity to give your side of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=140)|
| 0:02:25| story to this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=145)|
| 0:02:27| And then this body will deliberate and determine how the issues come out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=147)|
| 0:02:32| So at this time, I'm going to ask Captain Wolfie May if he'll come and talk to this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=152)|
| 0:02:43| On August 8, 2013, I conducted an underage beer sting at the Ebenezer Market, 600 Ebenezer Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=163)|
| 0:02:51| and purchased a six-pack of Bud Light.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=171)|
| 0:03:00| Mr. Patel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=180)|
| 0:03:01| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=181)|
| 0:03:03| How do you plea in this matter?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=183)|
| 0:03:05| Guilty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=185)|
| 0:03:07| I was coming in between different stores.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=187)|
| 0:03:09| Mr. May, Captain May, sent an undercover, and my employee didn't check the ID properly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=189)|
| 0:03:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=195)|
| 0:03:17| Captain May, the responsible vendor question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=197)|
| 0:03:22| No, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=202)|
| 0:03:24| Anything else you would like to say before this body?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=204)|
| 0:03:26| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=206)|
| 0:03:27| We've already ordered all new POS systems and scanning IDs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=207)|
| 0:03:32| So they should be in within three weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=212)|
| 0:03:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=214)|
| 0:03:35| Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=215)|
| 0:03:36| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=216)|
| 0:03:37| Do we have a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=217)|
| 0:03:40| I'll have to make a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=220)|
| 0:03:43| Well, I don't know what my motion is going to be until I ask the questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=223)|
| 0:03:46| I can't make a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=226)|
| 0:03:48| I do have a question for Wolfie, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=228)|
| 0:03:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=230)|
| 0:03:51| Can we have a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=231)|
| 0:03:53| I guess just to get in on the floor, I'll make a motion that we reverse the fence, right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=233)|
| 0:03:59| that we customarily find our revocation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=239)|
| 0:04:03| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=243)|
| 0:04:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=245)|
| 0:04:06| Mr. Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=246)|
| 0:04:07| Wolfie, this is the same gentleman that had an offense on his record personally before criminal court, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=247)|
| 0:04:16| Yes, at the Farragut Market on Kingston Pike there, the old waggles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=256)|
| 0:04:22| Did the citation go to him at this time or was it somebody else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=262)|
| 0:04:26| No, this was an employee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=266)|
| 0:04:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=270)|
| 0:04:31| I think, sir, we're entering into seeing you too much as a beer board if we're going to have these discussions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=271)|
| 0:04:40| If you don't, I understand you've ordered a, are you still on Farragut?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=280)|
| 0:04:45| What kind of point of service sales do you have there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=285)|
| 0:04:47| Do you have the scan or do you have, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=287)|
| 0:04:51| Well, I'm going to go along with this first offense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=291)|
| 0:04:54| But next time you come before me, it will be no, my motion will be no ability for a fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=294)|
| 0:05:01| It will be a suspension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=301)|
| 0:05:03| Well, I can say one thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=303)|
| 0:05:05| They only got their beer license in July, so it hasn't even been a month since they had their license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=305)|
| 0:05:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=315)|
| 0:05:16| Mr. Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=316)|
| 0:05:17| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=317)|
| 0:05:18| I had some questions along the same line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=318)|
| 0:05:20| And since he was just here a month ago and got this license,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=320)|
| 0:05:26| I'm thinking these things should be more fresh on his mind than what they seem to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=326)|
| 0:05:36| When he came before us the first time when we had a discussion about the criminal complaint or what have you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=336)|
| 0:05:45| he seems just to have a nonchalant attitude about the whole thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=345)|
| 0:05:48| Well, I can make a substitute motion and make it $1,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=348)|
| 0:05:57| I'll second it just to get it on the discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=357)|
| 0:06:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=360)|
| 0:06:01| We have a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=361)|
| 0:06:02| So the discussion is around the $1,000 now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=362)|
| 0:06:06| Any further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=366)|
| 0:06:11| Mr. Patel, do you want to respond to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=371)|
| 0:06:14| I apologize for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=374)|
| 0:06:15| I meant no disrespect for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=375)|
| 0:06:19| My first store, since we had Mr. May cite us in Farragut, I took care of everything, put a POS system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=379)|
| 0:06:26| I've never had an incident there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=386)|
| 0:06:28| Here, we just took over the store.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=388)|
| 0:06:30| I'm still using Weigel's property, their POS system until my gas system comes in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=390)|
| 0:06:36| I've already ordered everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=396)|
| 0:06:38| I mean, there's nothing really else I can say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=398)|
| 0:06:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=402)|
| 0:06:43| Mr. McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=403)|
| 0:06:45| So I found the last comment interesting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=405)|
| 0:06:48| So are you saying the previous owner didn't have a on-the-sale system?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=408)|
| 0:06:54| He did have a POS system, but it was a basic model.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=414)|
| 0:06:59| You have to actually, when someone comes in to buy cigarettes or tobacco or beer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=419)|
| 0:07:04| it asks you to input month, day, and year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=424)|
| 0:07:07| What the new system will be is there will be a two-dimensional barcode scanning system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=427)|
| 0:07:12| on the back of every driver's license throughout all 50 states.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=432)|
| 0:07:15| You have to scan that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=435)|
| 0:07:16| There's no manual entry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=436)|
| 0:07:18| If the barcode is rubbed out or scratched off, the system will not let you bring up the authorization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=438)|
| 0:07:26| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=446)|
| 0:07:27| Actually, I was taking my son to college and had the opportunity to go to Target,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=447)|
| 0:07:30| which I wish I could do here, and buy a bottle of wine, and they had that scanning system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=450)|
| 0:07:39| I guess it will still be a situation where if you don't have the right culture,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=459)|
| 0:07:46| if you don't have the right fear instilled into your employees that they're not going to do the scan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=466)|
| 0:07:53| they're going to want to sell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=473)|
| 0:07:54| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=474)|
| 0:07:55| There's probably a multitude of reasons why your employees or yourself at one point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=475)|
| 0:08:02| don't take this thing as seriously as you need to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=482)|
| 0:08:06| But, you know, I'm in favor of Commissioner Brown's substitute motion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=486)|
| 0:08:13| simply because we, you know, fool us once, shame on us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=493)|
| 0:08:18| If we keep coming back, there just seems to be a little smoke there in terms of the culture of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=498)|
| 0:08:26| I just firmly believe if at new employee orientation this is given the utmost importance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=506)|
| 0:08:33| if this is the one thing that my employee needs to know, I don't think we'll see repeat offenders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=513)|
| 0:08:40| And so I'm just hoping that that message gets delivered, that that culture at your multiple stores gets changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=520)|
| 0:08:48| There's obviously a cultural issue as far as selling to minors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=528)|
| 0:08:51| I don't know, you know, what those reasons are, but we really got to get this behind us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=531)|
| 0:08:57| So good luck, but I'm in favor of Commissioner Brown's substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=537)|
| 0:09:02| Mr. Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=542)|
| 0:09:04| Just a point of information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=544)|
| 0:09:05| If you'll notice the date, 8-8, that's less than two weeks after his license was approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=545)|
| 0:09:11| So off to the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=551)|

| 0:09:35| Mr. Patel, do you choose the 60 days or the thousand-dollar fine?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=575)|
| 0:09:38| The fine, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=578)|
| 0:09:39| You have seven days to pay that fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=579)|
| 0:09:42| Where can I go to pay it right now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=582)|
| 0:09:47| After the meeting at the county clerk's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=587)|
| 0:09:50| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=590)|
| 0:09:54| On the market, 9233 Westland Drive, Harry Krishna, Incorporated, owner, first offense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=594)|
| 0:10:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=601)|

| 0:10:12| Would you give your name and address, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=612)|
| 0:10:19| My name is Rakesh Patel, and I am from the Westland Market, 9233 Westland Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=619)|
| 0:10:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=626)|
| 0:10:27| Thank you, Mr. Patel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=627)|
| 0:10:28| Mr. Law Director?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=628)|
| 0:10:29| Mr. Patel, once again, today the procedures are that we will have the charging officer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=629)|
| 0:10:35| give the allegations against you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=635)|
| 0:10:38| You will have an opportunity to rebut those allegations and make a plea or a statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=638)|
| 0:10:43| And then we'll turn it over to this body for taking care of the issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=643)|
| 0:10:47| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=647)|
| 0:10:48| So at this time I'm going to call Captain Wolfie May, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=648)|
| 0:10:55| On 8-8-13, was conducting an underage beer sting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=655)|
| 0:11:03| a bottle of six-pack of Bud Light Lime at the Westland Market, 9233 Westland.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=663)|
| 0:11:20| Mr. May, is he a responsible vendor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=680)|
| 0:11:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=684)|
| 0:11:27| Mr. Patel, you're free to address this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=687)|
| 0:11:30| On this occasion, how do you plea?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=690)|
| 0:11:33| Actually, my employees are doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=693)|
| 0:11:40| I couldn't hear you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=700)|
| 0:11:41| What?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=701)|
| 0:11:43| It's that by mistake my wife did that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=703)|
| 0:11:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=705)|
| 0:11:47| She's working as an employee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=707)|
| 0:11:49| She made a mistake about checking the ID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=709)|
| 0:11:54| We just moved four months ago from New Jersey to Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=714)|
| 0:11:59| We didn't know about what the difference about 21, under 21 and out of 21 on a license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=719)|
| 0:12:06| So that's why we got a mistake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=726)|
| 0:12:10| Anything else you'd like to say to this body before I turn it over to them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=730)|
| 0:12:14| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=734)|
| 0:12:15| Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=735)|
| 0:12:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=736)|
| 0:12:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=737)|
| 0:12:18| Do I hear a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=738)|
| 0:12:19| Do I hear a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=739)|
| 0:12:21| On the floor, I'd like to ask a question first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=741)|
| 0:12:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=746)|
| 0:12:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=749)|
| 0:12:30| Mr. Mays, did you have something you wanted to say?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=750)|
| 0:12:36| If I'm not mistaken, these people also just got their permit in July also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=756)|
| 0:12:41| That was my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=761)|
| 0:12:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=762)|
| 0:12:45| And just to get this thing on, I think we'd probably put something on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=765)|
| 0:12:49| I move $500 and $430.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=769)|
| 0:12:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=775)|
| 0:12:56| Anything else, Mr. Brown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=776)|
| 0:12:59| Mr. Hammond?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=779)|
| 0:13:01| Well, if we're just out of curiosity, how many establishments would you go into in a course of an operation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=781)|
| 0:13:08| say a week or a month?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=788)|
| 0:13:13| That particular night I checked 26 places, cited three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=793)|
| 0:13:17| And there was two of them had gone out of business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=797)|
| 0:13:21| The reason I ask is because we have people out there who are checking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=801)|
| 0:13:25| who are making sure that they're not selling properly, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=805)|
| 0:13:29| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=809)|
| 0:13:30| And so that's why I wanted to kind of get a feel for if you did 26| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=810)|
| 0:13:33| and you had three and two were out of business, that means you had basically one out of 26.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=813)|
| 0:13:38| Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=818)|
| 0:13:40| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=820)|
| 0:13:41| I cited three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=821)|
| 0:13:42| Cited three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=822)|
| 0:13:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=823)|
| 0:13:44| The three of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=824)|
| 0:13:46| I cited three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=826)|
| 0:13:47| Oh, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=827)|
| 0:13:48| So the others were just, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=828)|
| 0:13:50| Yeah, three out of 23.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=830)|
| 0:13:52| I don't know what the percentage of that is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=832)|
| 0:13:54| But still, my point is there are people out there who are checking, who are making sure that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=834)|
| 0:13:59| and so the people who come before us, there's been some kind of lapse or some type of employee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=839)|
| 0:14:04| not doing what they're supposed to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=844)|
| 0:14:06| But we do have a lot who are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=846)|
| 0:14:08| And so my whole bottom line to this is that I don't have a problem with these fines and et cetera, et cetera,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=848)|
| 0:14:15| because we need to send a message that they need to be like these other people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=855)|
| 0:14:18| and check, double check and recheck if they have to, to make sure that we don't sell to underage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=858)|
| 0:14:24| One of the things that we do at the North Carolina Sheriff's Office is the sheriff sends a thank you note| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=864)|
| 0:14:29| to all the clerks that passed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=869)|
| 0:14:34| And so we do recognize those people also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=874)|
| 0:14:39| He sends a real nice letter to them thanking them for following the rules and the law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=879)|
| 0:14:46| Mr. Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=886)|
| 0:14:48| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=888)|
| 0:14:51| You know, note the date on this one also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=891)|
| 0:14:55| Again, less than two weeks after they got their license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=895)|
| 0:15:00| And I think we need to send a message to these folks that we are serious about this situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=900)|
| 0:15:06| And those of you that are here today applying for a permit, I hope you're listening,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=906)|
| 0:15:11| I'm going to make a substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=911)|
| 0:15:12| This will be $1,000 fine for 60 days also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=912)|
| 0:15:20| Okay, substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=920)|
| 0:15:21| Do we have a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=921)|
| 0:15:26| I think that fails for lack of a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=926)|
| 0:15:28| So we're back to our original motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=928)|
| 0:15:30| Any further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=930)|
| 0:15:33| $500 for 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=933)|
| 0:15:35| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=935)|
| 0:15:36| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=936)|
| 0:15:37| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=937)|
| 0:15:38| Ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=938)|
| 0:15:39| So it will be $500 to pay the clerk within seven days or 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=939)|
| 0:15:46| Which would you prefer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=946)|
| 0:15:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=950)|
| 0:15:51| Pay the fine?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=951)|
| 0:15:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=952)|
| 0:15:55| Mr. Patel, you have seven days to pay the clerk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=955)|
| 0:15:58| and you can make a payment to the clerk after this meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=958)|
| 0:16:03| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=963)|
| 0:16:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=964)|
| 0:16:05| Thank you, Mr. Patel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=965)|
| 0:16:07| Rocky Top Market, 2064 Castaic Drive, Rocky Top Market LLC, owner of First Defense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=967)|
| 0:16:15| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=975)|
| 0:16:16| Give your name and address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=976)|
| 0:16:18| My name is Diane Pearson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=978)|
| 0:16:20| I'm representing Rocky Top Market No. 34 on Castaic Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=980)|
| 0:16:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=986)|
| 0:16:27| Mr. Law Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=987)|
| 0:16:30| Ms. Pearson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=990)|
| 0:16:31| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=991)|
| 0:16:32| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=992)|
| 0:16:33| Ms. Pearson, as you have heard before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=993)|
| 0:16:35| I will ask the Sheriff's Department to bring forth the allegations against your company,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=995)|
| 0:16:41| and then you'll have an opportunity to bring your side of the story for this body,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=1001)|
| 0:16:45| and then we'll have them deliberate as to the outcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=1005)|
| 0:16:50| So I'm calling Captain Wolfie May, if you will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=1010)|
| 0:16:55| On August 8, 2013,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=1015)|
| 0:16:58| I was staying at Rocky Top Market, 2064 Castaic Lane and bought a six-pack Bud Light lime,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=1018)|
| 0:17:07| and they are a responsible vendor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=1027)|
| 0:17:14| Ms. Pearson, anything you'd like to say in this case?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=1034)|
| 0:17:18| How do you plead?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=1038)|
| 0:17:21| Well, sir, I have plenty to say about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=1041)|
| 0:17:24| Our employee did make a mistake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=1044)|
| 0:17:27| Are we guilty of being a careless convenience store owner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=1047)|
| 0:17:32| No, we are not, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=1052)|
| 0:17:33| I'd like to go into details if I have your permission to do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=1053)|
| 0:17:36| We are, in fact, a responsible vendor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=1056)|
| 0:17:39| Just as the officer said, there is a copy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=1059)|
| 0:17:41| It doesn't expire until November 2013.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=1061)|
| 0:17:45| I am also the corporate trainer as well as HR director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=1065)|
| 0:17:50| And the day before this young man sold beer in Officer Sting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=1070)|
| 0:17:55| he attended my three-hour alcohol sales class.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=1075)|
| 0:18:00| Officer Wolfie himself has attended one of my classes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=1080)|
| 0:18:03| and he knows I spend more than an hour talking about what do you do when you get the ID in your hand,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=1083)|
| 0:18:09| what to look at, the red bar under 21-year-old statement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=1089)|
| 0:18:14| and how you can just look at that and you're smart enough to know the date hasn't passed yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=1094)|
| 0:18:19| You give it right back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=1099)|
| 0:18:20| You never touch a piece of equipment and you refuse the sale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=1100)|
| 0:18:25| We even go through a role play of that during class.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=1105)|
| 0:18:29| Unfortunately, this young man did not do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=1109)|
| 0:18:32| He did not even type in the correct date of birth from her driver's license, which is on our policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=1112)|
| 0:18:40| I have a copy of that if you gentlemen would like to see it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=1120)|
| 0:18:44| It clearly states that if the customer appears to be under the age of 30,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=1124)|
| 0:18:48| they're to require the ID be taken out of the wallet for close inspection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=1128)|
| 0:18:52| and that they must use an ID coder that's provided by the Top Shelf Program to look at that date| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=1132)|
| 0:18:58| and type it in the register, and then you compare that date before you hand it back to the customer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=1138)|
| 0:19:04| He did not do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=1144)|
| 0:19:08| Part of my job is also mystery shopping.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=1148)|
| 0:19:11| We do take minors out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=1151)|
| 0:19:12| We like to monitor our own stores to see where we might have a manager not training,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=1152)|
| 0:19:18| not monitoring their staff as well as they should have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=1158)|
| 0:19:21| About two months prior to this illegal sale, I did check that store,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=1161)|
| 0:19:25| and we had an employee in that store make an illegal sale and was suspended for seven days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=1165)|
| 0:19:31| Word gets around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=1171)|
| 0:19:32| They know what's going on, and these employees don't make a lot of money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=1172)|
| 0:19:36| So seven days without pay is a lot of money to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=1176)|
| 0:19:40| They also signed the recent Knox County statement that was sent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=1180)|
| 0:19:45| I have Nathan's right here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=1185)|
| 0:19:47| We used it verbatim.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=1187)|
| 0:19:49| We did not change it, even though we have our own policy that includes this statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=1189)|
| 0:19:54| I said, no, we're using what Knox County sent out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=1194)|
| 0:19:56| I want it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=1196)|
| 0:19:57| We have Nathan's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=1197)|
| 0:19:59| Nathan is not an idiot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=1199)|
| 0:20:02| He was recently promoted to assistant manager.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=1202)|
| 0:20:05| One day we had hopes for him being a store manager.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=1205)|
| 0:20:08| So why he made this sale is beyond me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=1208)|
| 0:20:12| I don't know what else I can do unless I turn him into a robot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=1212)|
| 0:20:15| and program him to perform in a certain way, which we obviously cannot do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=1215)|
| 0:20:20| Now, part of my mystery shop, and I took a young girl out a few years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=1220)|
| 0:20:23| and unfortunately she was buying some beer from us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=1223)|
| 0:20:26| And I said, I don't get it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=1226)|
| 0:20:27| Why aren't people doing what they need to be doing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=1227)|
| 0:20:29| I like to use employees because it makes quite an impact on them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=1229)|
| 0:20:33| So let me tell you, Diane, we think we are smarter than the rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=1233)|
| 0:20:38| We don't think rules apply to us anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=1238)|
| 0:20:42| So I know how frustrating it must be for you guys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=1242)|
| 0:20:46| It's doubly more frustrating for us when we do so much from day one training to memos.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=1246)|
| 0:20:54| Managers check videotapes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=1254)|
| 0:20:56| They check paper tapes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=1256)|
| 0:20:58| And then you have an assistant manager make an illegal sale the day after he comes to class.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=1258)|
| 0:21:06| We have the equipment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=1266)|
| 0:21:07| They type in the date of birth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=1267)|
| 0:21:09| I love to have the scanners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=1269)|
| 0:21:11| It won't make it foolproof, but it would certainly help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=1271)|
| 0:21:15| So if you have any other suggestions for me, what we can be doing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=1275)|
| 0:21:18| because this is, I mean, we lost what otherwise would have been a decent employee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=1278)|
| 0:21:23| I think Lee was great because he would have been great had he not made that sale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=1283)|
| 0:21:29| Anything else you'd like to bring before this body?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=1289)|
| 0:21:31| Do I have any questions for you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=1291)|
| 0:21:33| You guys have questions for me that I can answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=1293)|
| 0:21:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=1295)|
| 0:21:36| Let me make a statement and I'll turn it over to the chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=1296)|
| 0:21:38| Let's get it on the floor and then there will be questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=1298)|
| 0:21:40| Do I hear a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=1300)|
| 0:21:42| Do you want to say something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=1302)|
| 0:21:44| One item of clarification to the body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=1304)|
| 0:21:49| This particular vendor is not subject to suspension or revocation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=1309)|
| 0:21:53| You can only fine them up to $1,000 maximum for this offense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=1313)|
| 0:21:57| Even though it is a first offense, I'm just giving you the parameters of what the law is for a responsible vendor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=1317)|
| 0:22:03| So it will only be a dollar fine and the fine can go up to $1,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=1323)|
| 0:22:08| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=1328)|
| 0:22:10| I'd like to make a motion that we fine this vendor $500.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=1330)|
| 0:22:15| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=1335)|
| 0:22:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=1337)|
| 0:22:18| Mr. Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=1338)|
| 0:22:20| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=1340)|
| 0:22:21| I think, Ms. Pearson, you may have read between the lines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=1341)|
| 0:22:23| You may have kind of answered my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=1343)|
| 0:22:25| But knowing that you all are selling off some of your stores, I'm assuming this is one you're keeping?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=1345)|
| 0:22:32| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=1352)|
| 0:22:33| It's the one you're getting rid of?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=1353)|
| 0:22:35| We have sold it, yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=1355)|
| 0:22:37| So this happened before that sale transaction went through?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=1357)|
| 0:22:41| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=1361)|
| 0:22:42| So it's on you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=1362)|
| 0:22:43| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=1363)|
| 0:22:45| That was my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=1365)|
| 0:22:46| Let me say this, that in working with the Metropolitan Drug Commission, I know that Rocky Top,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=1366)|
| 0:22:52| they have their own in-house training programs and they've worked very well with the Metropolitan Drug Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=1372)|
| 0:22:58| And to answer your question, Ms. Pearson, I don't know what the answer is unless you just get a bigger baseball bat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=1378)|
| 0:23:04| It would probably be against the law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=1384)|
| 0:23:07| Ms. Freeman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=1387)|
| 0:23:09| I applaud you for the actions that you're taking and the steps that you're taking to prevent this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=1389)|
| 0:23:13| What happened to Nathan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=1393)|
| 0:23:15| He was terminated per our company policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=1395)|
| 0:23:19| You know, this happens quite a bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=1399)|
| 0:23:21| You know, you go through the steps, you go through the process, you always anticipate people doing the right thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=1401)|
| 0:23:26| and then for whatever reason, they don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=1406)|
| 0:23:30| Again, you know, we've talked about this before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=1410)|
| 0:23:33| Is there actions that you can take against the employee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=1413)|
| 0:23:36| And a lot of times the employee, they're cited to court, what, for 11 months, 29 days, possibly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=1416)|
| 0:23:40| They lose their jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=1420)|
| 0:23:42| You would think that that would be deterrent enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=1422)|
| 0:23:44| But in some cases it's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=1424)|
| 0:23:46| And so it was interesting, your comment, that the individual said, well, we just don't think the rules apply to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=1426)|
| 0:23:51| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=1431)|
| 0:23:52| She did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=1432)|
| 0:23:53| Which I found that really surprising because it's been frustrating when you train so hard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=1433)|
| 0:23:57| and you stress these details and you role play,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=1437)|
| 0:24:01| and then you still have people with sale within just a few weeks of coming to class.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=1441)|
| 0:24:06| It's like, what am I doing wrong?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=1446)|
| 0:24:08| What am I not getting across to you what you need to be doing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=1448)|
| 0:24:11| But that's what they feel like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=1451)|
| 0:24:12| Oh, I'm smart enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=1452)|
| 0:24:13| I can tell someone's over 21.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=1453)|
| 0:24:15| And I really believe, too, that a lot of employees may assume the person's over 21| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=1455)|
| 0:24:20| and just really don't go through all the detailed steps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=1460)|
| 0:24:23| It's not just asking for the ideas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=1463)|
| 0:24:25| No, what to do with it when you have it in your hands, which I try to teach that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=1465)|
| 0:24:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=1473)|
| 0:24:34| Thank you, Ms. Pearson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=1474)|
| 0:24:35| We have a motion before us, $500.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=1475)|
| 0:24:38| Any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=1478)|
| 0:24:40| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=1480)|
| 0:24:41| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=1481)|
| 0:24:42| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=1482)|
| 0:24:43| Ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=1483)|
| 0:24:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=1486)|
| 0:24:47| Thanks, Ms. Pearson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=1487)|
| 0:24:48| You have seven days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=1488)|
| 0:24:49| And we're sorry you've gone through all this trouble.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=1489)|
| 0:24:51| These things do happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=1491)|
| 0:24:53| The nature of the youth, maybe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=1493)|
| 0:24:56| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=1496)|
| 0:24:57| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=1497)|
| 0:24:58| Deferred application, Catarina Mateo and Pedro Tienda, Latino, 1738 Emory Road, off premises.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=1498)|
| 0:25:07| Mr. Chairman, can I do my usual address to these applicants before?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=1507)|
| 0:25:11| Because some of them may leave before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=1511)|
| 0:25:14| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=1514)|
| 0:25:15| Go ahead, Mr. Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=1515)|
| 0:25:16| Those of you who are here today for a beer license, before you leave,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=1516)|
| 0:25:22| you need to see the young lady in the back holding her hand up in a pretty flowered dress back there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=1522)|
| 0:25:26| because she has something that might keep you from coming back up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=1526)|
| 0:25:30| So please see her before you leave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=1530)|
| 0:25:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=1532)|
| 0:25:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=1535)|
| 0:25:36| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=1536)|
| 0:25:37| Would you give their name and address, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=1537)|
| 0:25:41| I'd like to say something else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=1541)|
| 0:25:43| I was asked by Sandra Sexton to come as an interpreter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=1543)|
| 0:25:46| I'm a professional accord interpreter of Spanish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=1546)|
| 0:25:50| But upon coming, I discovered that Catarina Mateo Pedro speaks Canjoval, which is a Mayan dialect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=1550)|
| 0:26:00| And so her friend, Angelina De Francisco, is going to interpret.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=1560)|
| 0:26:05| But I kind of explained to her how this works, that she needs to interpret everything that is being said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=1565)|
| 0:26:13| And to ask you all to slow down, please, when she cannot follow what you're saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=1573)|
| 0:26:20| She, in my opinion, is not a trained interpreter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=1580)|
| 0:26:23| But I cannot function because I do not speak that dialect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=1583)|
| 0:26:27| So I'm going to retrieve and just let you know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=1587)|
| 0:26:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=1592)|

| 0:32:48| This application is for beer to be sold and taken away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=1968)|
| 0:32:54| You do not consume the beer at this location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=1974)|

| 0:33:05| Is an application for on, on and off, or off-premises sale of beer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=1985)|

| 0:33:34| which means the beer is consumed somewhere else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=2014)|
| 0:33:39| You do not sell it to be consumed at the location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=2019)|
| 0:33:43| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=2023)|
| 0:33:55| They're just going to buy and take the beer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=2035)|

| 0:47:03| and being responsible for the stores that they've acquired.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=2823)|

| 0:47:11| Well, since you're coming from Rocky Top,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=2831)|
| 0:47:13| I guess you're familiar with the Knox County, Tennessee, beer laws and regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=2833)|

| 0:47:46| I'm going to ask staff recommendations at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=2866)|

| 0:48:10| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=2890)|

| 0:48:16| that you will be petitioning as a responsible vendor then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=2896)|
| 0:48:21| We have turned that over to Lehigh's legal staff in Allentown to review that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=2901)|
| 0:48:25| We have recommended that they do become a Tennessee responsible vendor, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=2905)|

| 0:48:42| and, of course, the surrender of the prior license that you have in one hand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=2922)|
| 0:48:46| or the other, I know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=2926)|

| 0:57:15| Today I want to address the controversy over the Sheriff's Office application to take part in the 287G program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=3435)|
| 0:57:22| at the Bureau of Immigration and Customs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=3442)|
| 0:57:25| I'm one of the folks that you've probably seen some of this in the newspaper recently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=3445)|
| 0:57:29| I'm one of the folks who urged the sheriff and the county commission to drop this program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=3449)|
| 0:57:37| The program was canceled last week, but unfortunately not without a lot of antagonism.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=3457)|
| 0:57:45| I'm sure everyone involved has the good of our community at heart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=3465)|
| 0:57:49| I am asking you, as our elected leaders with official relationships to the Sheriff's Office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=3469)|
| 0:57:54| to please help us get beyond the fears and disappointments and focus on the good of the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=3474)|

| 0:58:03| They pose no threat to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=3483)|
| 0:58:04| On the contrary, they contribute to every part of our economy and culture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=3484)|
| 0:58:09| They could contribute more if so many were not under the daily threat of losing their jobs, homes, and families.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=3489)|
| 0:58:16| Knox County would be a much better place if these folks felt welcomed rather than fearful| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=3496)|
| 0:58:21| and thankful for rather than suspicious of law enforcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=3501)|
| 0:58:26| This climate of distrust does not have to prevail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=3506)|
| 0:58:29| You all can help by setting a positive tone and brokering productive interactions between immigrants and all our officials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=3509)|
| 0:58:36| I don't see the cancellation of the 287G as a loss for the Sheriff's Office but a chance to reset relationships.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=3516)|
| 0:58:44| I know folks who are ready to sit down at any time to resolve questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=3524)|
| 0:58:48| Any help commission can give us will be deeply appreciated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=3528)|
| 0:58:53| One last thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=3533)|
| 0:58:54| This precarious status of this whole category of our neighbors is going to continue to give us headaches until we get a handle on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=3534)|
| 0:59:02| Just as slavery was, this is in direct conflict with our democratic traditions, so please don't kick this can down the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=3542)|
| 0:59:12| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=3552)|
| 0:59:14| Thank you, Mr. De Leon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=3554)|
| 0:59:17| Mayor Burchett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=3557)|
| 0:59:27| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=3567)|
| 0:59:28| Tim Burchett, 501 Princeton Court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=3568)|
| 0:59:31| My permanent address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=3571)|
| 0:59:33| No take backs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=3573)|
| 0:59:35| I want to thank you for allowing me to be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=3575)|
| 0:59:38| I have a proclamation recognizing our Mobile Meals volunteers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=3578)|
| 0:59:44| Of course, everybody knows it's an important role it plays in our community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=3584)|
| 0:59:49| and we have with us two of our long-time Mobile Meals volunteers, Libba Jaco.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=3589)|
| 0:59:54| Libba, stand up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=3594)|
| 0:59:57| She's been with a 40-year volunteer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=3597)|
| 1:00:00| So as of yesterday, I would have been nine years old when she started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=3600)|
| 1:00:06| And Joan Register, she is a 20-year volunteer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=3606)|
| 1:00:10| We thank these two ladies for their volunteer service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=3610)|
| 1:00:18| I could read and present this proclamation if that would be appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=3618)|
| 1:00:21| That would be fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=3621)|
| 1:00:22| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=3622)|
| 1:00:23| It's a Mobile Meals volunteer appreciation day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=3623)|
| 1:00:28| Whereas Knox County's Office on Aging Mobile Meals Program provides meals to nearly 1,000 homebound seniors in Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=3628)|
| 1:00:35| in Knox County, five days a week and on holidays,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=3635)|
| 1:00:38| and whereas the homebound seniors serve Mobile Meals would not have access to this service| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=3638)|
| 1:00:44| without the commitment of more than 4,000 volunteers annually,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=3644)|
| 1:00:47| and whereas in 2012 Mobile Meals volunteers contributed nearly 19,000 volunteer hours,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=3647)|
| 1:00:54| with more volunteer hours anticipated this year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=3654)|
| 1:00:57| and whereas Knox County is a community filled with caring people who share a true volunteer spirit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=3657)|
| 1:01:01| and who came together to raise more than $125,000 for Mobile Meals during a telethon on July 29, 2013,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=3661)|
| 1:01:09| now therefore I, Knox County Mayor Tim Burchett, hereby proclaim August 26, 2013,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=3669)|
| 1:01:15| as Mobile Meals Volunteer Appreciation Day in Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=3675)|
| 1:01:18| and urge all of our citizens to join in this observance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=3678)|
| 1:01:22| And now I can present that to you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=3682)|
| 1:01:28| Very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=3688)|
| 1:01:52| They are very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=3712)|
| 1:01:53| And, of course, I would like to say, too, with the help of this community and this commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=3713)|
| 1:01:59| we were able to raise more than $125,000 for Mobile Meals during last month's telethon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=3719)|
| 1:02:05| I want to personally thank Commissioners Shouse and Wright for coming out and answering the phones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=3725)|
| 1:02:12| Also, I want to thank Commissioner Hammond, who really just went overboard in helping us with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=3732)|
| 1:02:19| He got us in with the media early, and that was imperative to the whole thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=3739)|
| 1:02:23| And, of course, you had a concert, and it provided ñ it was a heck of a lot of fun.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=3743)|
| 1:02:28| But more than that, it's going to feed a lot of hungry people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=3748)|
| 1:02:31| So this is something this community and this commission can be proud of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=3751)|
| 1:02:34| and I just want to thank you all from the bottom of my heart for the hard work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=3754)|
| 1:02:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=3757)|
| 1:02:38| Thank you, Mayor Burchett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=3758)|
| 1:02:40| Thank you, ladies, the volunteers that have done so much work for Mobile Meals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=3760)|
| 1:02:46| Thank you, ladies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=3766)|
| 1:02:49| Now, do we have anybody else for public forum?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=3769)|
| 1:02:55| Any other speakers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=3775)|
| 1:02:57| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=3777)|
| 1:02:58| The rest of that agenda, honorary, there is an honorary that we will do after zonings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=3778)|
| 1:03:05| which is the last honorary for Drew McIntosh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=3785)|
| 1:03:09| So we'll hold that off until then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=3789)|
| 1:03:11| Let's move into our regular meeting, our regular August meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=3791)|
| 1:03:17| So I'll call that to order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=3797)|
| 1:03:18| Will you call roll again, please, Madam Clerk?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=3798)|

| 1:03:28| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=3808)|

| 1:03:30| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=3810)|

| 1:03:36| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=3816)|
| 1:03:37| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=3817)|
| 1:03:38| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=3818)|
| 1:03:39| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=3819)|
| 1:03:40| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=3820)|
| 1:03:41| We're going to give us our devotional today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=3821)|
| 1:03:42| Go ahead, Mr. Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=3822)|
| 1:03:43| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=3823)|
| 1:03:45| As most commissioners would realize of my tenure of being on commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=3825)|
| 1:03:50| when I think it really important, I have to stand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=3830)|
| 1:03:55| Today I stand and I am really honored to be able to give the devotion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=3835)|
| 1:03:58| And I want to divide the devotion into two parts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=3838)|
| 1:04:03| One is sort of like an invocation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=3843)|
| 1:04:05| What are we going to do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=3845)|
| 1:04:07| And the other is I ask that we be blessed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=3847)|
| 1:04:12| The invocation part of it, I want to look at a book.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=3852)|
| 1:04:16| I'll refer to it as Genesis and a couple of brothers, Esau and Jacob.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=3856)|
| 1:04:23| And as those that may have read, you know there were a lot of things that went on between them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=3863)|
| 1:04:29| They had issues with each other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=3869)|
| 1:04:31| They had issues with those around them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=3871)|
| 1:04:35| And from about the 25th chapter to the 33rd chapter, they really had a lot of trouble.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=3875)|
| 1:04:43| But what happened when they finally realized, one, Jacob realized that his trouble,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=3883)|
| 1:04:49| maybe he had overdone it and he needed to go do something differently,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=3889)|
| 1:04:54| decided he was going to go home, he sort of lined his people up going home| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=3894)|
| 1:04:58| and he put the less important family members in the front thinking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=3898)|
| 1:05:01| well, if Esau really gets on them, I can see what's going on, maybe I can escape.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=3901)|
| 1:05:09| But on his way there, he changed his mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=3909)|
| 1:05:13| He said, hmm, maybe I need to be in front.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=3913)|
| 1:05:18| And if there's somebody to pay, it needs to be me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=3918)|
| 1:05:21| Well, as he approached, he had servants filling out what's in front,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=3921)|
| 1:05:25| and somebody said, hey, brother's come down the road and he's got 400 men with him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=3925)|
| 1:05:30| And he began to worry for just a moment until he got closer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=3930)|
| 1:05:35| and saw that his brother was coming to invite him back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=3935)|
| 1:05:39| And they hugged and they made up and they went on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=3939)|
| 1:05:42| The only reason I say that is because there's nothing nearly that drastic that ever happens at county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=3942)|
| 1:05:49| We usually take a bag of marshmallows and just make a single peak, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=3949)|
| 1:05:53| like Mount LeConte or House Mountain, out of that bag of marshmallows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=3953)|
| 1:05:58| But I do implore us as we meet and as we deliberate and as we discuss,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=3958)|
| 1:06:04| we don't hold it against each other about where we are or what we need to be doing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=3964)|
| 1:06:09| what we need to be about, because therein comes the blessing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=3969)|
| 1:06:14| We, Knox County Commission, need to be involved in representing those who have got us here to do that very thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=3974)|
| 1:06:24| We need to be very diligent about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=3984)|
| 1:06:26| We need to do the best we can with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=3986)|
| 1:06:30| And therein comes the I-don't-have-to-remember-what-happened-yesterday scenario.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=3990)|
| 1:06:38| I ask that we think of all those around the world that are defending us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=3998)|
| 1:06:42| I ask that we think of those that are here today in this room doing the best they can to do what we need to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=4002)|
| 1:06:51| And to that I say amen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=4011)|
| 1:06:56| Thank you, Mr. Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=4016)|
| 1:06:57| Mr. Hammond is going to lead us in the pledge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=4017)|
| 1:07:00| If you would rise, please, face the flag and give proper salute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=4020)|
| 1:07:03| I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=4023)|
| 1:07:08| and to the republic for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=4028)|

| 1:07:38| Under amendments to the agenda, I would like to move our ordinance from the pension board to the front of the agenda| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=4058)|
| 1:07:49| to save the pension board some money, if there is no objections to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=4069)|
| 1:08:04| Okay, do we have other amendments to the agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=4084)|
| 1:08:16| Okay, can I hear a motion to add, defer, withdraw all necessary items?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=4096)|

| 1:10:40| This is on 13-8-206 regarding the grant for learning activities after school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=4240)|
| 1:10:51| Can you tell me how those schools were selected to be in that program?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=4251)|
| 1:11:02| Thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=4262)|

| 1:11:05| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=4265)|
| 1:11:06| This is a 21st century community learning center grant, and I believe that there are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=4266)|
| 1:11:12| some eligibility requirements in terms of where the schools can be, in terms of things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=4272)|
| 1:11:18| like income requirements, and may even be some requirements in terms of student population| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=4278)|
| 1:11:25| and things of that nature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=4285)|
| 1:11:26| So I'd have to get back with you with the specifics, Commissioner Brown, but I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=4286)|
| 1:11:31| there are some target populations for that grant that these schools would have met that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=4291)|
| 1:11:37| criteria, and so we would have used that in the development of the grant application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=4297)|
| 1:11:41| This is, of course, a competitive grant, and so we would have developed an application| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=4301)|
| 1:11:45| that included those schools in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=4305)|
| 1:11:47| But I can certainly get back with you and provide you with the information regarding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=4307)|

| 1:23:14| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=4994)|
| 1:23:15| And I think we're working on some way to avoid reading consent, is that true?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=4995)|
| 1:23:20| I don't know whether we can do it or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=5000)|

| 1:23:50| Okay, let's take five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=5030)|
| 1:23:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=5033)|
| 1:23:54| Take a seat and resume our meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=5034)|
| 1:24:24| All right, Madam Clerk, first item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=5064)|
| 1:24:46| First item is on page 16, it's resolution 808, it's designating or committing and appropriating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=5086)|
| 1:24:53| funds in the total amount of $4,867,833.76 from fiscal year 2013 to fiscal year 2014| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=5093)|
| 1:25:04| for various funds and departments not funded in the current budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=5104)|
| 1:25:08| Make a motion to approve as presented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=5108)|
| 1:25:11| Okay, Mr. Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=5111)|
| 1:25:15| Now this is the list that was handed out to us today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=5115)|
| 1:25:18| I have a couple of questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=5118)|
| 1:25:21| Mr. Caldwell, the $500,000 salary survey, that's not for the survey, is it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=5121)|
| 1:25:28| So is that to take care of the results of the survey?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=5128)|
| 1:25:30| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=5130)|
| 1:25:32| Also the million dollars for the indigent care program, this is being carried over from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=5132)|
| 1:25:36| last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=5136)|
| 1:25:37| Does that mean obviously that we didn't spend that money?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=5137)|
| 1:25:40| Does that mean that we're seeing a decrease in the amount of indigent care in our office?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=5140)|
| 1:25:47| That is not correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=5147)|
| 1:25:49| As you may recall during the budget process, we had a committed fund balance amount of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=5149)|
| 1:25:57| a million dollars for indigent care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=5157)|
| 1:26:01| So we anticipated a surplus and we're going to use some of that money to carry over in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=5161)|
| 1:26:05| the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=5165)|
| 1:26:06| So it's to fully fund the indigent care request of $4.25 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=5166)|
| 1:26:12| So we're not actually seeing a decrease.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=5172)|
| 1:26:13| That's why when I saw that, I thought, well, if we're having less people do that, then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=5173)|
| 1:26:18| that obviously is a good thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=5178)|
| 1:26:20| Those are the only questions I had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=5180)|
| 1:26:22| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=5182)|
| 1:26:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=5183)|
| 1:26:24| Other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=5184)|
| 1:26:25| Mr. Anders?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=5185)|
| 1:26:26| Yeah, I just, I don't know if J.J.'s, yeah, J.J.'s still in here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=5186)|
| 1:26:31| If you go down the list there, you look at the sheriff's department, the tourniquets| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=5191)|
| 1:26:34| and AEDs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=5194)|
| 1:26:35| I want to make a statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=5195)|
| 1:26:37| The most recent, and I hope I'm not out of line, Sheriff, but the most recent shooting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=5197)|
| 1:26:41| where the deputy was, the sergeant was shot out West Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=5201)|
| 1:26:47| We've recently been trained in tactical tourniquets and that, I believe, that saved his life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=5207)|
| 1:26:53| And so these things cost $60 a piece, the kit's $100 a piece, but I just want you to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=5213)|
| 1:26:59| know some of the stuff that we list on here actually makes a difference and saves lives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=5219)|
| 1:27:03| And that deputy's life was saved because somebody applied a tourniquet to his leg.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=5223)|
| 1:27:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=5228)|
| 1:27:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=5229)|
| 1:27:11| Other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=5231)|
| 1:27:12| Mr. McKenzie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=5232)|
| 1:27:13| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=5233)|
| 1:27:14| Just so, the salary survey, does that, I know it didn't put us, you know, 110% of salaries| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=5234)|
| 1:27:22| of municipalities like ours, but where does this rebalancing put us in terms of our competitiveness?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=5242)|
| 1:27:31| And I'm assuming that you all went after targeted positions where we weren't competitive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=5251)|
| 1:27:36| Does that, I guess my question is, was the goal to get maybe 90% of that or something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=5256)|
| 1:27:42| like that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=5262)|
| 1:27:43| And then how do we fare?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=5263)|
| 1:27:44| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=5264)|
| 1:27:45| So as we started the salary survey process, we picked between 70 and 75 positions and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=5265)|
| 1:27:53| each department had got to select four or five or whatever, and some bigger departments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=5273)|
| 1:27:58| got more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=5278)|
| 1:28:00| And so we surveyed those positions along with the senior director positions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=5280)|
| 1:28:07| And when we got back the results, Mark Jones, myself, and Richard Julian and Diana Sweet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=5287)|
| 1:28:16| put together a process to get those positions to market within the next two years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=5296)|
| 1:28:23| And so we did the vast majority of that in year one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=5303)|
| 1:28:28| Five hundred thousand won't cover the total cost, but we always have some savings and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=5308)|
| 1:28:34| salaries that make up for those things, and to me that's fair enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=5314)|
| 1:28:42| So we'll do about, I think, about 400,000 more for the next year, and then what happens| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=5322)|
| 1:28:50| is you survey 70 jobs, okay, but it may affect 140 or 200, and I don't know the number that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=5330)|
| 1:28:59| it affected because there's a lot of stepping, I guess, in some of those positions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=5339)|
| 1:29:05| And so what we found out from the survey is we were actually in fairly good shape.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=5345)|
| 1:29:12| There were some jobs that were below market that we addressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=5352)|
| 1:29:17| There were some that may be above that we addressed as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=5357)|
| 1:29:21| But for the most part, it wasn't that far out of line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=5361)|
| 1:29:29| Any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=5369)|
| 1:29:33| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=5373)|
| 1:29:34| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=5374)|
| 1:29:35| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=5375)|
| 1:29:36| Opposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=5376)|
| 1:29:37| Congratulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=5377)|
| 1:29:40| And well done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=5380)|
| 1:29:45| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=5385)|
| 1:29:46| The next item is on page 18, resolution 904.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=5386)|
| 1:29:50| It's expressing the commission's support of the Marketplace Fairness Act of 2013 and requesting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=5390)|
| 1:29:56| the Knox County clerk to send a true and correct copy of this resolution to Congressman John Duncan, Jr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=5396)|
| 1:30:02| Resolution 904.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=5402)|
| 1:30:05| I'll make the motion to approve this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=5405)|
| 1:30:07| I know we had a lot of discussion about it, but I'll make a motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=5407)|
| 1:30:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=5411)|
| 1:30:12| Mr. Ham.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=5412)|
| 1:30:14| I want to make a substitute motion that we postpone this for 30 days and here's why.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=5414)|
| 1:30:20| In looking into this and talking with some folks, there are more questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=5420)|
| 1:30:26| Let's get a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=5426)|
| 1:30:28| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=5428)|
| 1:30:29| I thought you got a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=5429)|
| 1:30:30| We got.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=5430)|
| 1:30:31| Oh, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=5431)|
| 1:30:32| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=5432)|
| 1:30:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=5433)|
| 1:30:34| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=5434)|
| 1:30:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=5435)|
| 1:30:36| We've got it now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=5436)|
| 1:30:37| The reason I'm asking for this is the more I've delved into this and at the workshop I said I was going to make some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=5437)|
| 1:30:41| phone calls and I did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=5441)|
| 1:30:42| There seems to be more questions that I have than answers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=5442)|
| 1:30:45| And even though this is a federal thing, it does affect sales tax and therefore it affects us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=5445)|
| 1:30:50| And so I've had a conversation with Mr. Caldwell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=5450)|
| 1:30:54| As with all federal legislation or all legislation in general, the devil's in the details.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=5454)|
| 1:31:02| There are exemptions here, collection issues, et cetera, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=5462)|
| 1:31:07| So I'm just asking that we step back for a moment and let's really know what this bill says| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=5467)|
| 1:31:14| because I think there's some things in there that we really, really need to know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=5474)|
| 1:31:18| And, you know, I'm not opposed to it by any means because I'm for fairness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=5478)|
| 1:31:23| But I think that I would like to really know what this bill does and the impact it's going to have on sales tax,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=5483)|
| 1:31:28| not only on the state level but here on the local level as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=5488)|
| 1:31:32| And I've enlisted Mr. Caldwell's assistance in trying to get some of these questions answered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=5492)|
| 1:31:36| That's why I'm asking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=5496)|
| 1:31:37| I'm not trying to go on a crusade or anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=5497)|
| 1:31:39| I just want some questions to this because, as I said, the more I've delved into it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=5499)|
| 1:31:43| the more questions I have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=5503)|
| 1:31:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=5505)|
| 1:31:46| Mr. Caldwell, do you want to respond?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=5506)|
| 1:31:48| What we will do in the finance department is we will go ahead and research| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=5508)|
| 1:31:54| and make some results of what we find out by looking at this Fairness Act| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=5514)|
| 1:32:02| or this Marketplace Fairness Act, and then we can report back in 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=5522)|
| 1:32:06| And maybe we'll have a list of pros and cons, pros and cons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=5526)|
| 1:32:10| We won't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=5530)|
| 1:32:11| It's not my job to opine, but we can just give you facts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=5531)|
| 1:32:15| and then you all can make a determination on what you all want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=5535)|
| 1:32:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=5538)|
| 1:32:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=5539)|
| 1:32:20| Ms. Burroughs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=5540)|
| 1:32:21| I just wanted to know what some of Mike's questions were.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=5541)|
| 1:32:24| I was just curious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=5544)|
| 1:32:25| Well, the exemptions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=5545)|
| 1:32:26| I was also wondering about the collections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=5546)|
| 1:32:28| And, you know, I mean, they collect sales taxes all the time, but then you get into the Internet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=5548)|
| 1:32:32| And so there were just some things in the bill that I just was interested in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=5552)|
| 1:32:36| I didn't have a chance to get into it in great detail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=5556)|
| 1:32:38| These are just some of the issues that have come up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=5558)|
| 1:32:40| And so that's why I'm talking with Chris.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=5560)|
| 1:32:42| I'd really like for us to really look at this because we're asking to put our seal of approval on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=5562)|
| 1:32:46| and it does affect us and it affects the state as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=5566)|
| 1:32:49| And so I just want to know what we're voting on and to really delve into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=5569)|
| 1:32:53| And so I think another 30 days would be prudent for us to get that information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=5573)|
| 1:32:59| Have you talked to anybody at NACO about this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=5579)|
| 1:33:01| Yes, and that was where I started getting questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=5581)|
| 1:33:03| And so that's why, you know, a lot of people all across the country are asking questions, not just us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=5583)|
| 1:33:07| And so that's why I'm just asking for a little bit more time so that we can delve into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=5587)|
| 1:33:11| And working with Chris's staff, I think we can come back and say, okay, here's what it says.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=5591)|
| 1:33:16| Here are the facts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=5596)|
| 1:33:17| Here are the pros.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=5597)|
| 1:33:18| Here are the cons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=5598)|
| 1:33:19| And then everybody can make their decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=5599)|
| 1:33:20| I haven't looked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=5600)|
| 1:33:21| Do they have anything on their website that relates to this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=5601)|
| 1:33:24| I don't know because I've made some phone calls to talk directly with people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=5604)|
| 1:33:28| Mr. McKenzie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=5608)|
| 1:33:30| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=5610)|
| 1:33:31| So, you know, that's the one piece that I had concern with last week was the amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=5611)|
| 1:33:38| that talked about it being revenue neutral.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=5618)|
| 1:33:41| And that, to me, gets into that similar conversation what Commissioner Hammond was talking about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=5621)|
| 1:33:45| what Chris was talking about during our luncheon is, you know, sometimes a revenue neutral thing at the federal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=5625)|
| 1:33:52| means additional taxes or lack of income at the local level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=5632)|
| 1:33:56| And that's really what I wanted to ensure is that we do our due diligence before we support, even though it's only,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=5636)|
| 1:34:02| you know, it's not any, it carries the weight of the paper that it's sent to Washington on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=5642)|
| 1:34:08| But it does indicate that we support this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=5648)|
| 1:34:11| And if it ends up coming where there's a, you know, sales tax issue, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=5651)|
| 1:34:17| we're heavily, heavily dependent on sales tax, you know, here in the state of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=5657)|
| 1:34:21| So thank you for doing that research.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=5661)|
| 1:34:24| And hopefully Chris and his staff can do their due diligence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=5664)|
| 1:34:29| and get us a decent answer back whether we want to support this or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=5669)|
| 1:34:32| So thank you for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=5672)|
| 1:34:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=5674)|
| 1:34:35| Other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=5675)|
| 1:34:36| So we've got before us a 30-day deferral.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=5676)|
| 1:34:39| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=5679)|
| 1:34:40| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=5680)|

| 1:34:42| Ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=5682)|
| 1:34:44| The next item is on Page 19, Resolution 908.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=5684)|
| 1:34:49| It's approving a memorandum of understanding for the retirement of Richard Walls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=5689)|
| 1:34:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=5697)|
| 1:34:58| Could I hear a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=5698)|
| 1:34:59| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=5699)|
| 1:35:01| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=5701)|
| 1:35:02| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=5702)|
| 1:35:04| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=5704)|
| 1:35:08| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=5708)|
| 1:35:10| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=5710)|
| 1:35:11| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=5711)|
| 1:35:12| Ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=5712)|
| 1:35:16| The next item is on Page 20, Resolution 909.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=5716)|
| 1:35:20| It's to approve the engagement of Pew and Company, PC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=5720)|
| 1:35:23| to provide additional services under its contract with Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=5723)|
| 1:35:27| which additional services include the performance of four procedures related to the Knox County Trustee's Office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=5727)|
| 1:35:33| with one procedure performed each quarter for an estimated total cost of $12,000 funded in the current budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=5733)|
| 1:35:41| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=5741)|
| 1:35:43| Discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=5743)|
| 1:35:45| I hope everyone got the letter about five or six days ago and explains it in detail what this would mean.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=5745)|
| 1:35:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=5754)|
| 1:35:55| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=5755)|
| 1:35:56| Mr. Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=5756)|
| 1:35:57| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=5757)|
| 1:36:01| It's related to this, but it's not a part of this, but this is a point where we may need to discuss something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=5761)|
| 1:36:09| What we're doing with this resolution is something that sort of comes under the shade of internal auditing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=5769)|
| 1:36:20| I'm not saying it's internal auditing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=5780)|
| 1:36:22| I'm just saying it's sort of shaded that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=5782)|
| 1:36:25| And I believe that the law director will give us advice that there are two kinds of auditing that take place in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=5785)|
| 1:36:33| The external auditor once a year, making sure the books, like, add up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=5793)|
| 1:36:40| And then the internal auditor, a function which we, County Commission, send someone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=5800)|
| 1:36:50| whether it be contracted or employee, to look at something, audit something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=5810)|
| 1:36:58| So what we're doing here is sort of the shade of internal auditing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=5818)|
| 1:37:02| And I only say it for the fact that the full commission need to understand that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=5822)|
| 1:37:07| and then get the audit committee to go off in whatever direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=5827)|
| 1:37:12| Full commission would like to see the auditing committee undertake as a means of doing internal auditing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=5832)|
| 1:37:23| And we may, we've got two things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=5843)|
| 1:37:27| We can either have an, we can have a county employee do it or we can have a contractor do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=5847)|
| 1:37:34| And I think contracting is where we were headed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=5854)|
| 1:37:37| We just never got there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=5857)|
| 1:37:38| I just want to make sure that if that's what commission wants is what the audit committee needs to be about doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=5858)|
| 1:37:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=5865)|
| 1:37:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=5866)|
| 1:37:47| Thank you, Mr. Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=5867)|
| 1:37:48| Other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=5868)|

| 1:38:38| They do eat poison ivy, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=5918)|

| 1:39:02| We're on page 22, under other business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=5942)|
| 1:39:05| The first item is a spread of record, the Knox County Mayor's Order reappointing Robert Cry to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=5945)|

| 1:39:20| Third item is discussion regarding the Joint Education Committee meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=5960)|
| 1:39:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=5964)|
| 1:39:25| Mr. McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=5965)|
| 1:39:26| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=5966)|
| 1:39:27| You know, we had our regular scheduled meeting on August the 8th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=5967)|
| 1:39:33| Majority, I'd say, yeah, a majority of the conversation kind of centered around, I guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=5973)|
| 1:39:38| the most politically charged aspect of that meeting was about how the Sunshine Law applied| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=5978)|
| 1:39:48| to this committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=5988)|
| 1:39:50| And please, I beg the other committee members to chime in if they heard something different| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=5990)|
| 1:39:58| at the end of the day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=5998)|
| 1:39:59| But there was a lot of discussion around that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=5999)|
| 1:40:02| And, you know, it hits me particularly hard because, I guess, I'm the only sitting commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=6002)|
| 1:40:09| that has a cohort, a district cohort, on the committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=6009)|
| 1:40:14| So if this Sunshine Law meant that we couldn't discuss any aspect, education slash commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=6014)|
| 1:40:24| anything where our roads cross, then that was going to really be a strain for both of us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=6024)|
| 1:40:31| to remain on that committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=6031)|
| 1:40:32| But, again, please chime in if you heard something different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=6032)|
| 1:40:35| I think at the end of the meeting, subject to them coming back and verifying next month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=6035)|
| 1:40:43| we're going out, moving out with the mindset that if there's anything that is on the agenda for a joint education| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=6043)|
| 1:40:51| that might be on the agenda for the joint education committee, that those issues would come under the Sunshine Law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=6051)|
| 1:41:01| But if we're talking about whether to buy red chairs or blue chairs at Chihuly Elementary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=6061)|
| 1:41:06| that's not subject because that's not anything that's on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=6066)|
| 1:41:10| That's something that Gloria Dethridge and I can have a conversation about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=6070)|
| 1:41:14| And we can meet and talk about how the roadrunners are doing this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=6074)|
| 1:41:18| So, you know, so that gave me a little, me personally, a little comfort in that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=6078)|
| 1:41:25| that our jobs weren't going to be limited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=6085)|
| 1:41:28| But that's, again, subject to the law department coming back next month to, I won't say to verify that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=6088)|
| 1:41:35| but to do their additional research on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=6095)|
| 1:41:38| So, but, again, we're spending a lot of time, good time, but just really talking about process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=6098)|
| 1:41:46| And I do agree that, you know, once we can set the process, I think it will be a productive meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=6106)|
| 1:41:54| So we're, again, scheduled to meet again on this time, the first Thursday in September,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=6114)|
| 1:42:03| looking up that date as we speak, at 430.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=6123)|
| 1:42:07| So that is the first Thursday is the fifth at 430 at the Andrew Johnson Building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=6127)|
| 1:42:13| So welcome, commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=6133)|
| 1:42:15| Please come and please look at the notes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=6135)|
| 1:42:18| There were notes sent out, I think, last week, just general notes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=6138)|
| 1:42:21| Just take a look at that if you want detail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=6141)|
| 1:42:24| But, you know, there's a lot of dialogue, a lot of conversations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=6144)|
| 1:42:27| So at this point, I'll be quiet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=6147)|
| 1:42:29| I think I saw Commissioner Hammond's light on first and then right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=6149)|
| 1:42:33| I'm not taking your job there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=6153)|
| 1:42:34| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=6154)|
| 1:42:35| Just let me be quiet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=6155)|
| 1:42:37| I'll come back over to the chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=6157)|
| 1:42:38| I've just got a few minutes left now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=6158)|
| 1:42:41| Don't be jumping in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=6161)|
| 1:42:43| Mr. Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=6163)|
| 1:42:45| I want to just echo what Commissioner McKenzie said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=6165)|
| 1:42:47| and that is a lot of the discussion was based around the Sunshine Law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=6167)|
| 1:42:51| And there was an editorial in the newspaper and also Snark Bites did an article, which, by the way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=6171)|
| 1:42:58| I really enjoy his writing, even though I am the subject of it from time to time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=6178)|
| 1:43:01| I do find it funny and tongue-in-cheek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=6181)|
| 1:43:05| But the issue, and I want to make it very clear, the issue was not do we support or not the Sunshine Law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=6185)|
| 1:43:11| That wasn't the issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=6191)|
| 1:43:12| Or do we have or are we trying to meet in secret behind closed doors?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=6192)|
| 1:43:16| That was not the issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=6196)|
| 1:43:18| The issue was what can we discuss and what can't we discuss in these meetings?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=6198)|
| 1:43:23| And when the meeting began, Commissioner McKenzie submitted his resignation from the committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=6203)|
| 1:43:28| because he felt very strongly that if he could not discuss first district education issues with Gloria Deathridge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=6208)|
| 1:43:35| that it would not serve him to be on that committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=6215)|
| 1:43:37| And so he submitted his resignation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=6217)|
| 1:43:39| Luckily, he withdrew it after we had a discussion about what could and could not be discussed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=6219)|
| 1:43:44| And that was really the issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=6224)|
| 1:43:46| What can we talk about in that committee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=6226)|
| 1:43:48| Because before I became a member of the committee, I could talk to any member of the school board anywhere,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=6228)|
| 1:43:51| anytime about anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=6231)|
| 1:43:53| Now that I'm on the committee, if an issue is going to come before us on that committee, then we can't discuss it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=6233)|
| 1:43:59| But as we mentioned in the meeting, if there's an issue at Austin East or if there's an issue at Chilhowee that is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=6239)|
| 1:44:04| specific to the school and it's not going to be brought before us, then it's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=6244)|
| 1:44:10| I mean, at that point, Commissioner McKenzie said, well, I'm comfortable with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=6250)|
| 1:44:14| And, of course, there is a remedy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=6254)|
| 1:44:15| Let's say that we do have a discussion and then six months from now something is brought up before the committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=6255)|
| 1:44:20| All we do is just say, folks, we discussed this six months ago, not really knowing it was going to come before the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=6260)|
| 1:44:26| committee, and so we're now making that public that that discussion was held six months ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=6266)|
| 1:44:32| So, you know, those are things that we can do and refrain from the discussion, et cetera, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=6272)|
| 1:44:37| So my point is that there are opportunities for us to go ahead and discuss issues that are not going to be brought| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=6277)|
| 1:44:45| before this committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=6285)|
| 1:44:46| I think the only other thing that I would add would be that we did spend a lot of time talking about the budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=6286)|
| 1:44:52| and the budget process after we got past this other and we all felt comfortable with where we were going in terms of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=6292)|
| 1:44:58| what we could and could not talk about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=6298)|
| 1:44:59| We talked about the budget process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=6299)|
| 1:45:00| And I thought we had a very, very good discussion about that process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=6300)|
| 1:45:04| And it's interesting to see the school board's perspective and the commissioner's perspective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=6304)|
| 1:45:08| And I think this is healthy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=6308)|
| 1:45:09| It's a healthy discussion to have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=6309)|
| 1:45:11| And so I look forward to having more of these discussions because from where they sit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=6311)|
| 1:45:15| and where we sit, we don't always see it the same way, but we are respectful of each other's views and opinions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=6315)|
| 1:45:22| So I'm glad we've gotten beyond this issue and that we're moving on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=6322)|
| 1:45:28| But I just wanted to point out that at no time were we against the sunshine law, wanting to meet in secret,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=6328)|
| 1:45:34| trying to violate anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=6334)|
| 1:45:35| We just wanted clarification of what could and could not be discussed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=6335)|
| 1:45:38| And I think our law department has given us really good guidance on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=6338)|
| 1:45:43| Mr. Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=6343)|
| 1:45:44| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=6344)|
| 1:45:48| The conversation as we're carrying on with it here right now is a part of the dialogue that's taking place on the small| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=6348)|
| 1:45:57| committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=6357)|
| 1:46:00| We've discussed sunshine two or three different times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=6360)|
| 1:46:07| I believe that the discussion as we last had it really revealed the dilemma that faces Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=6367)|
| 1:46:22| Last week, Board of Education member Mike McMillan and I visited, well, over the last three weeks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=6382)|
| 1:46:32| we visited all the schools that were advertised as being visited by the superintendent, Dr. McIntyre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=6392)|
| 1:46:41| The two of us together with Dr. McIntyre, all of those schools in the 8th District, we visited what he visited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=6401)|
| 1:46:51| Now his schedule goes to he does not advertise where he's going to visit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=6411)|
| 1:46:58| And the schools are on notice he'll be there sometime this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=6418)|
| 1:47:04| But the one school that was not in the 8th District, Holston, Board of Education member Ms. Deathridge was there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=6424)|
| 1:47:13| And as we ended up standing, she and I, standing on the front sidewalk of the school, I thought to myself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=6433)|
| 1:47:22| boy, I can see where Commissioner McKenzie now has concern because it's not about what might happen at Chul Howie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=6442)|
| 1:47:31| It's even worse than that, in my opinion, because Ms. Deathridge and I being on that committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=6451)|
| 1:47:40| I don't think we can even talk about South Doyle or wherever it is there was a state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=6460)|
| 1:47:45| No, it's Austin East.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=6465)|
| 1:47:47| The stadium renovation is before the Board of Education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=6467)|
| 1:47:50| It will also be before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=6470)|
| 1:47:53| And I don't think that we should have talked about that if the subject had come up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=6473)|
| 1:47:58| just the two of us standing on the sidewalk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=6478)|
| 1:48:01| Well, I am really in a quandary about where we need to go,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=6481)|
| 1:48:05| and I'll be looking for a more definitive explanation of what Sunshine is and how it applies to the small committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=6485)|
| 1:48:16| We have been in deep discussion of process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=6496)|
| 1:48:20| We did spend quite a bit of the training session on the budget process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=6500)|
| 1:48:27| and what may be viewed as the shortcomings of what we got before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=6507)|
| 1:48:31| But the big thing that's still before that committee is how it deals with Sunshine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=6511)|
| 1:48:38| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=6518)|
| 1:48:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=6519)|
| 1:48:40| Thank you, Mr. Ryan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=6520)|
| 1:48:41| Anything else about an education committee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=6521)|
| 1:48:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=6525)|
| 1:48:46| Anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=6526)|
| 1:48:48| We're to the end of our agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=6528)|
| 1:48:49| So seeing no further business, we're adjourned until five o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=6529)|
| 1:48:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=6536)|
| 1:49:06| Okay, commissioners, let's and ladies and gentlemen, let's call this zoning portion of August zonings to order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=6546)|
| 1:49:14| Madam Clerk, will you call the roll?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=6554)|
| 1:49:16| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=6556)|
| 1:49:17| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=6557)|
| 1:49:18| Commissioner Boyles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=6558)|
| 1:49:19| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=6559)|
| 1:49:20| Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=6560)|
| 1:49:21| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=6561)|

| 1:49:23| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=6563)|
| 1:49:24| Commissioner Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=6564)|
| 1:49:25| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=6565)|
| 1:49:26| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=6566)|
| 1:49:27| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=6567)|
| 1:49:28| Commissioner Schaus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=6568)|
| 1:49:29| We have 11 members present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=6569)|
| 1:49:33| Okay, Madam Clerk, first item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=6573)|
| 1:49:36| First item is on page 226-C-13-SP, request of MPC for Jack Walker for northeast county sector plan amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=6576)|
| 1:49:47| from NC Neighborhood Commercial to RC Rural Commercial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=6587)|
| 1:49:51| located southeast side, Tillett Lane, North Appalachian Road, 8th Commission District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=6591)|
| 1:49:56| Mr. Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=6596)|
| 1:49:57| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=6597)|
| 1:49:58| I erred at the last zoning meeting in not requesting or did not request a deferral for two meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=6598)|
| 1:50:06| What has happened is there is a second portion of this coming out of MPC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=6606)|
| 1:50:10| and our schedules didn't meet up and it was a two-month delay instead of a one-month delay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=6610)|
| 1:50:15| So now I request that we delay this to the next meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=6615)|
| 1:50:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=6620)|
| 1:50:21| So that will be deferred until September without objection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=6621)|
| 1:50:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=6625)|
| 1:50:26| Thank you, Mr. Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=6626)|

| 1:51:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=6700)|
| 1:51:41| Mr. Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=6701)|
| 1:51:42| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=6702)|
| 1:51:45| The request that's before us, we need a motion first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=6705)|
| 1:51:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=6710)|
| 1:51:51| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=6711)|
| 1:51:52| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=6712)|
| 1:51:53| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=6713)|
| 1:51:54| Mr. Wright, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=6714)|
| 1:51:55| Looking at the proceedings of the Metropolitan Planning Commission and reading their minutes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=6715)|
| 1:52:00| it's noted that all of the adjacent property to this particular 99 almost 100 acres is agricultural.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=6720)|
| 1:52:09| The request and the only request that's before us is that this 99 acres plus be rezoned agricultural.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=6729)|
| 1:52:19| Having said that, the applicant may want to speak to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=6739)|
| 1:52:24| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=6744)|
| 1:52:26| I think he's covered it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=6746)|
| 1:52:27| I just want to rezone it to agricultural.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=6747)|
| 1:52:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=6749)|
| 1:52:31| Anything else, Mr. Wright?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=6751)|
| 1:52:34| You've got Dr. Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=6754)|
| 1:52:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=6755)|
| 1:52:36| You've got the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=6756)|
| 1:52:39| I'm going to close.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=6759)|
| 1:52:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=6761)|
| 1:52:43| Dr. Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=6763)|
| 1:52:44| I just had a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=6764)|
| 1:52:45| I don't think we've seen these before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=6765)|
| 1:52:47| What is open space, and what can you do in agricultural that you can't do in open space?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=6767)|
| 1:52:52| This is a general question, not so much with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=6772)|
| 1:52:55| But why, you know, why would someone want to change?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=6775)|
| 1:52:59| This particular property was rezoned from agriculture to open space several years ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=6779)|
| 1:53:06| when the owners were working on an equestrian-themed operation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=6786)|
| 1:53:15| and the permitted uses for open space were much better in alignment than those for agriculture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=6795)|
| 1:53:24| It allowed equestrian trails and those types of uses, whereas those weren't mentioned in the agricultural zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=6804)|
| 1:53:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=6813)|
| 1:53:36| Do you want me to go ahead?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=6816)|
| 1:53:38| Mr. Wright, are you still holding off?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=6818)|
| 1:53:41| I'm not holding on anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=6821)|
| 1:53:42| The reason that I feel like that this needs to be approved is, as stated, everything around it is agricultural.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=6822)|
| 1:53:51| This is 100 acres, and it's got trees and deer and whatever else you might have on really non-farmed farmland.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=6831)|
| 1:54:02| The issue that came before MPC, and maybe represented here if someone from the opposition would like to speak,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=6842)|
| 1:54:10| is a rumored process that this may subsequently turn into being a rock query.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=6850)|
| 1:54:16| I believe that was questioned at MPC, and I'm looking at MPC right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=6856)|
| 1:54:22| but I can't really find that part of the conversation, Mr. Claiborne, about what was your response to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=6862)|
| 1:54:29| are you going to have a rock query?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=6869)|
| 1:54:32| We didn't have any plans at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=6872)|
| 1:54:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=6874)|
| 1:54:35| It's merely speculation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=6875)|
| 1:54:36| Now, I got that same response from a member of the Metropolitan Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=6876)|
| 1:54:42| In fact, the chair of the Planning Commission is Ms. Longmire, and that's the response I got from her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=6882)|
| 1:54:50| At some future time, if you're going to anticipate a rock query,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=6890)|
| 1:54:56| I believe that you'll find there will be a lot of opposition to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=6896)|
| 1:55:00| There is no opposition, though, for me about it being agricultural.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=6900)|
| 1:55:04| And I just wanted to say that so they'd be a part of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=6904)|
| 1:55:07| I believe we have to have a better record here than we have to have in commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=6907)|
| 1:55:12| So, thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=6912)|
| 1:55:14| Mr. Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=6914)|
| 1:55:15| Yeah, I just want to say I'm going to support you in this, Mr. Claiborne,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=6915)|
| 1:55:18| but I just want to publicly thank you for what your company does in this community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=6918)|
| 1:55:21| the way that you give back so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=6921)|
| 1:55:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=6923)|
| 1:55:25| Mr. Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=6925)|
| 1:55:26| Again, I just had a general question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=6926)|
| 1:55:28| I think that rock quarrying would require a mining.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=6928)|
| 1:55:32| I mean, it's a different zoning entirely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=6932)|
| 1:55:34| I remember we had Vulcan or something out there that needed to change there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=6934)|
| 1:55:38| and I believe that falls under a mining zoning, doesn't it, or not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=6938)|
| 1:55:42| In the agricultural zone, it does permit mining and mineral extraction, but it's use on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=6942)|
| 1:55:49| So it would require the review of a plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=6949)|
| 1:55:53| Plus, I believe there are other requirements in terms of a plan of operation, that kind of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=6953)|
| 1:55:58| It would have to come back to MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=6958)|
| 1:56:00| But doesn't there was isn't there some unique part about mining that usually use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=6960)|
| 1:56:08| on review does not come back to the county commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=6968)|
| 1:56:11| but mining is one area that would have to come back, wouldn't it, or not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=6971)|
| 1:56:15| I think that was a real odd law they had on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=6975)|
| 1:56:19| The point being is that it would have to come back before us and not BZA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=6979)|
| 1:56:22| but mining is different than I think almost anything else on use on review is my recollection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=6982)|
| 1:56:30| I believe you're correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=6990)|
| 1:56:32| I think there is something in the zoning ordinance, and I believe it has.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=6992)|
| 1:56:36| And it's different than any of the things that normally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=6996)|
| 1:56:39| If you give me a chance, I can look it up right quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=6999)|
| 1:56:41| But if that's not what I'd answer, we can move on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=7001)|
| 1:56:45| I'm pretty sure it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=7005)|
| 1:56:46| So you would come back to this body and not the BZA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=7006)|
| 1:56:49| Ultimately, you would for that, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=7009)|
| 1:56:51| Well, I think it's a two-pronged approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=7011)|
| 1:56:54| You have something approved by MPC and you have something approved by this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=7014)|
| 1:56:57| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=7017)|
| 1:56:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=7019)|
| 1:57:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=7020)|
| 1:57:02| Mr. Hampton?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=7022)|
| 1:57:03| I just want to hear from the gentleman in opposition if he wishes to speak, hear what he has to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=7023)|
| 1:57:06| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=7026)|
| 1:57:12| I don't know if you're all familiar with Gary out there, but I live up on top of the hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=7032)|
| 1:57:15| First house on Alex Bales Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=7035)|
| 1:57:18| Could you repeat your name and address, sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=7038)|
| 1:57:21| My name is George Webb.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=7041)|
| 1:57:22| I live at 10031 Alex Bales Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=7042)|
| 1:57:26| It's a half a mile down the corner from Smith School where this property is located.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=7046)|
| 1:57:35| I just heard about this last night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=7055)|
| 1:57:39| You know, it's all new to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=7059)|
| 1:57:43| My opposition being to it is that maybe on the west side of Smith School,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=7063)|
| 1:57:53| that might be just residential commercial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=7073)|
| 1:57:57| but most of the property on the opposite side of the road is all subdivided| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=7077)|
| 1:58:02| and I would say probably still residential agricultural because the most of the subdivisions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=7082)|
| 1:58:10| that I know of, the lots, are fairly good sized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=7090)|
| 1:58:15| The one I bought was only two, but previous owners probably had about eight acres there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=7095)|
| 1:58:21| And my neighbors got eight, somewhere in that vicinity, so most people out there do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=7101)|
| 1:58:28| I'm just curious as to how this man thought this could go through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=7108)|
| 1:58:34| From what I understand, he bought the property just recently with the assumption that this was going to go through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=7114)|
| 1:58:41| And I'm just curious as to how he would have assumed that he could go ahead and start up a rock quarry out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=7121)|
| 1:58:49| Like I said, I have heard that, and that's all I know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=7129)|
| 1:58:53| And that came with the notice that I received, which I just got yesterday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=7133)|
| 1:58:59| But that's what they were turning it into.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=7139)|
| 1:59:01| And that would be my only objection, is that it becomes a rock quarry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=7141)|
| 1:59:06| If there's other things he's got to go through in order to do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=7146)|
| 1:59:09| then I can hold off here a while and see what else goes on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=7149)|
| 1:59:13| And I'm sure my neighbors would like to know more about what's going on, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=7153)|
| 1:59:18| But, again, as I started to say, if he'd bought the property already,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=7158)|
| 1:59:24| assuming that he could put in a quarry, if that's what his plans were,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=7164)|
| 1:59:27| I would like to know where he got the information that he could just go ahead and start a quarry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=7167)|
| 1:59:34| That's all I have to say at this point in time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=7174)|
| 1:59:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=7177)|
| 1:59:38| Thank you, Mr. Webb.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=7178)|
| 1:59:41| Mr. Claiborne, do you want to respond to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=7181)|
| 1:59:43| Do you have intentions for the property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=7183)|
| 1:59:52| I guess more directly, do you have any intentions for a quarry on the property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=7192)|
| 1:59:57| Right now, I don't have any intentions for a quarry right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=7197)|
| 2:00:00| But you could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=7200)|
| 2:00:02| I'm in the quarry business, so people just automatically assume that because I own 100 dump trucks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=7202)|
| 2:00:06| They think that I'm naturally going to put a rock quarry there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=7206)|
| 2:00:09| But we have other places that we're mining right now, so we don't need that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=7209)|
| 2:00:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=7213)|
| 2:00:14| We're just merely speculation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=7214)|
| 2:00:15| That's the last undeveloped intersection up through there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=7215)|
| 2:00:17| The 402 is not developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=7217)|
| 2:00:19| So I'm young, and I figure at some point it will develop,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=7219)|
| 2:00:22| because the 407 is picking up and, you know, several others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=7222)|
| 2:00:25| So that's why I merely bought it from the bank.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=7225)|
| 2:00:27| It was in foreclosure, so I bought it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=7227)|
| 2:00:29| I thought it was a good deal, so I'm looking at it as an investment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=7229)|
| 2:00:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=7232)|
| 2:00:33| Thank you, Mr. Claiborne.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=7233)|
| 2:00:34| Mr. Chairman, just to confirm that it is a requirement in the use on review section| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=7234)|
| 2:00:39| where you have the regulations for all the various kinds of uses on review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=7239)|
| 2:00:43| that is a requirement in the agricultural zone that something be approved by MPC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=7243)|
| 2:00:48| and also approved by this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=7248)|
| 2:00:50| So you've got a two-pronged approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=7250)|
| 2:00:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=7252)|
| 2:00:52| So that should give you a little bit of comfort, Mr. Webb, if this did indeed go to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=7252)|
| 2:00:59| or Mr. Claiborne later wanted to convert this to a quarry,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=7259)|
| 2:01:03| there would be quite an extensive process for him to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=7263)|
| 2:01:07| So going through MPC and commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=7267)|
| 2:01:11| So do we have any other questions, discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=7271)|
| 2:01:16| We have a motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=7276)|

| 2:03:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=7405)|
| 2:03:26| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=7406)|
| 2:03:27| The applicant, would you come down, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=7407)|
| 2:03:33| Give your name and address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=7413)|
| 2:03:35| Josh Sanderson, 4909 Ball Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=7415)|
| 2:03:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=7418)|
| 2:03:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=7419)|
| 2:03:41| Do we have any questions for the applicant?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=7421)|
| 2:03:46| Mr. Anders?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=7426)|
| 2:03:47| I'll speak to it, I guess, a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=7427)|
| 2:03:50| I think the opposition is probably concerned with two things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=7430)|
| 2:03:55| One was the road conditions, the intersection of Garrison and Gray Hendricks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=7435)|
| 2:04:01| and then also possibly the connection into the other subdivision that MPC is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=7441)|
| 2:04:07| Does that still go through MPC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=7447)|
| 2:04:09| the connection into the other subdivision was required by the developer or required by the MPC?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=7449)|
| 2:04:16| The developer didn't really want to do it, but the MPC is mandating it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=7456)|
| 2:04:20| Is that a correct statement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=7460)|
| 2:04:23| Well, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=7463)|
| 2:04:26| There wasn't much to it, you know, and I don't recall much debate at the meeting about the requirements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=7466)|
| 2:04:31| and conditions, but there is a road improvement that is contemplated with Garrison| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=7471)|
| 2:04:35| and will bring it into a T with Gray Hendricks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=7475)|
| 2:04:38| And then there are some good connectivity with the subdivision with property to the east| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=7478)|
| 2:04:44| as well as another outlet to Gray Hendricks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=7484)|
| 2:04:48| So, you know, MPC was staffed and the MPC was satisfied that the development is going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=7488)|
| 2:04:55| to have some alternative access points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=7495)|
| 2:04:59| And then plus there's sidewalk revision for within the interior of the subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=7499)|
| 2:05:06| Ma'am, if you would like to come, if you would like to speak on the opposition side, I mean, Mr. Chairman,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=7506)|
| 2:05:11| it's up to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=7511)|
| 2:05:12| I don't think there's any other questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=7512)|
| 2:05:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=7513)|
| 2:05:24| Okay, thank you, ladies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=7524)|
| 2:05:25| Just give your, whoever's going to speak, give your name and address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=7525)|
| 2:05:30| And you have five minutes if you need it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=7530)|
| 2:05:33| My name is Tina Lett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=7533)|
| 2:05:35| I'm a resident of 8508 Garrison Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=7535)|
| 2:05:40| And our concern, he did say we have a concern with the intersection of Gray Hendricks and Garrison.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=7540)|
| 2:05:47| Our concern actually goes well beyond that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=7547)|
| 2:05:49| We've tried, I know several people in the community have tried to reach Mr. Anders to discuss these concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=7549)|
| 2:05:56| But we're talking about an area that goes from the school all the way back out to Byington Beaver Ridge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=7556)|
| 2:06:01| back to Byington's Hallway and around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=7561)|
| 2:06:03| Absolutely no access.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=7563)|
| 2:06:05| These roads are used daily for travel, not only in the schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=7565)|
| 2:06:10| but by people who are cutting through there to avoid traffic lights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=7570)|
| 2:06:14| So Ms. Bacon here, who lives on Gray Hendricks as well, has some photos to show the traffic back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=7574)|
| 2:06:21| up just during the school time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=7581)|
| 2:06:22| But that's not the only issues that we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=7582)|
| 2:06:25| We have problems with road width.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=7585)|
| 2:06:27| We have problems with no shoulders on the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=7587)|
| 2:06:30| I mean, there was a Knox County deputy who was killed in 2000 while investigating a shooting by a car who came up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=7590)|
| 2:06:38| from behind and hit two officers standing there in the street with blue lights flashing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=7598)|
| 2:06:42| So it creates a situation well beyond the one intersection that they seem to think is going to correct the problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=7602)|
| 2:06:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=7612)|
| 2:06:53| Would you like to speak, ma'am?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=7613)|
| 2:06:56| We felt that Gray Hendricks Road is our road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=7616)|
| 2:06:59| Linda Bacon, 2809 Gray Hendricks Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=7619)|
| 2:07:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=7623)|
| 2:07:04| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=7624)|
| 2:07:05| Gray Hendricks Road is a narrow road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=7625)|
| 2:07:08| Children really do not have a sidewalk to walk to school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=7628)|
| 2:07:12| And this development is going to be in the parent responsibility zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=7632)|
| 2:07:18| It is a dangerous road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=7638)|
| 2:07:20| The pictures I have show you gridlock along Gray Hendricks near the middle school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=7640)|
| 2:07:27| And the cars are halted, stopped all the way to Roland Lane, which is very close to Beaver Ridge-Byington Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=7647)|
| 2:07:39| Needless to say, these photos show cars stopped in front of this development all the way across the Gray Hendricks side of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=7659)|
| 2:07:50| This is the traffic we deal with now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=7670)|
| 2:07:54| I can only imagine if you built, you know, several hundred homes without sidewalks for safety for the kids to walk to school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=7674)|
| 2:08:05| I know the development will have sidewalks, but I'm worried about the kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=7685)|
| 2:08:09| I know I'm fearful to walk Gray Hendricks Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=7689)|
| 2:08:13| I just won't do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=7693)|
| 2:08:15| I've lived there 35 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=7695)|
| 2:08:18| I'm just very worried about the safety of the kids and the narrow, narrow road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=7698)|
| 2:08:23| I even have photos of cars at a standstill with buses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=7703)|
| 2:08:29| And this is a two-lane road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=7709)|
| 2:08:31| Buses passing the stopped cars to get to the middle school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=7711)|
| 2:08:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=7719)|
| 2:08:40| Thank you, Ms. Bacon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=7720)|
| 2:08:41| Mr. Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=7721)|
| 2:08:45| Buzz and Mark, what have they done to address the traffic issue there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=7725)|
| 2:08:49| Have they done a traffic study?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=7729)|
| 2:08:52| I'm afraid they did one when school wasn't on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=7732)|
| 2:08:57| I think the pictures speak for themselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=7737)|
| 2:09:06| Yes, I was looking back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=7746)|
| 2:09:08| There was a specific condition on number six where they were going to have to conduct an eight-hour turning move| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=7748)|
| 2:09:13| and study at the intersection of Gray Hendricks and Garrison| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=7753)|
| 2:09:18| and then update the traffic impact study to analyze the new data with the proposed improvements for the intersection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=7758)|
| 2:09:24| So they're going to have to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=7764)|
| 2:09:27| And that could add some additional information with regard to whatever improvements may be needed further on down the line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=7767)|
| 2:09:36| But they did do a traffic study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=7776)|
| 2:09:38| And the approved plan that went before MPC back this early part of this month reflects any,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=7778)|
| 2:09:46| you know, any needed improvements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=7786)|
| 2:09:48| And then this was an additional condition that was approved as a part of the concept plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=7788)|
| 2:09:53| that the additional counts be made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=7793)|
| 2:09:57| Now, they're saying that they want more counts made,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=7797)|
| 2:09:59| but they haven't really said about specific improvements to the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=7799)|
| 2:10:04| To be honest with you, I cannot tell you whether the counts have been completed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=7804)|
| 2:10:07| and whether that information has been submitted for analysis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=7807)|
| 2:10:11| Mark may have some additional information on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=7811)|
| 2:10:14| With the original application, they submitted a traffic study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=7814)|
| 2:10:18| But because school was not in session, they made assumptions about traffic based on previous histories| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=7818)|
| 2:10:27| as to when school was in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=7827)|
| 2:10:30| So we had a traffic study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=7830)|
| 2:10:33| The condition was to update it once we get some real numbers and bring that up to speed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=7833)|
| 2:10:39| They have agreed to reconfigure the Garrison-Gray-Hendrix intersection by donating significant rights away| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=7839)|
| 2:10:47| and making improvements, creating a T intersection the other way with Garrison T'ing into Gray-Hendrix.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=7847)|
| 2:10:55| Well, those pictures are very compelling to me because when I look at those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=7855)|
| 2:10:58| and I see that and that's twice a day, I'm imagining morning and afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=7858)|
| 2:11:02| And so that's why, you know, if the studies haven't been done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=7862)|
| 2:11:07| and we don't know what specific improvements might be made,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=7867)|
| 2:11:10| I'm just kind of wondering if we approve this, where do we go from here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=7870)|
| 2:11:15| And also my second question, let me ask you this question before we get to the other one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=7875)|
| 2:11:18| and that is how many houses are we looking at?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=7878)|
| 2:11:20| If it's four units up to four units per acre, approximately how many dwellings are we looking at?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=7880)|
| 2:11:25| The concept plan was approved at 185 lots,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=7885)|
| 2:11:29| which actually came in at 3.24 dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=7889)|
| 2:11:33| So it was even lower than what was recommended by APC for a density| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=7893)|
| 2:11:38| and lower even more than what they originally requested, which was five dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=7898)|
| 2:11:43| And have they looked at how many kids they expect to come from that neighborhood?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=7903)|
| 2:11:48| The estimated yield, and we have a formula and a process where we can estimate how many kids will come out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=7908)|
| 2:11:56| It was estimated that the student yield from the subdivision would be 98 students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=7916)|
| 2:12:02| And it would be, you know, it could be spread over the elementary school, the middle school, and the high school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=7922)|
| 2:12:07| You know, we don't know what combinations we'd be attending, but that's kids ages five through 18.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=7927)|
| 2:12:14| So if it's in the parent responsibility zone, they're either going to have to walk,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=7934)|
| 2:12:18| which I hear that that's probably not a most parents are probably not going to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=7938)|
| 2:12:22| They're probably going to be taking the kids, is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=7942)|
| 2:12:23| So that's going to add more traffic from what we've already seen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=7943)|
| 2:12:27| It may, but the developer has agreed to put a sidewalk system, an internal sidewalk system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=7947)|
| 2:12:33| throughout the subdivision and connect it to an additional subdivision that the same company is doing on the east side| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=7953)|
| 2:12:40| or on the west side so that pedestrian traffic literally can cut through that new subdivision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=7960)|
| 2:12:48| in order to make its way right across the street from the middle school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=7968)|
| 2:12:53| So the 98-ers is a variety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=7973)|
| 2:12:55| I mean, if you've got kindergartners, you're probably not going to want them to walk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=7975)|
| 2:12:59| My point is, is on the traffic thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=7979)|
| 2:13:01| And so Dwight Van DeVate is here, and I hate to bring you into the discussion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=7981)|
| 2:13:05| but are you familiar with this intersection?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=7985)|
| 2:13:07| Can you shed some light on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=7987)|
| 2:13:09| I'm familiar with it, but not that specific intersection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=7989)|
| 2:13:17| Thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=7997)|
| 2:13:18| I'm somewhat familiar with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=7998)|
| 2:13:19| It ties into a larger project that we have that the Commission is familiar with called the Carnage Connector.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=7999)|
| 2:13:25| And we've incorporated some of the improvements in the Garrison| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=8005)|
| 2:13:28| and Gray-Hendrix area into the Carnage Connector project, which we recently had a public meeting on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=8008)|
| 2:13:33| So probably more importantly, I have one of the staff engineers, John Sexton, here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=8013)|
| 2:13:38| So if we have technical questions about alignment and things like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=8018)|
| 2:13:41| we should be prepared to answer most of those tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=8021)|
| 2:13:43| Yes, I'm just kind of wondering about improvements that are going to be made with the development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=8023)|
| 2:13:48| And so if we approve this, I guess this was my other question to the MPC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=8028)|
| 2:13:51| and I want to hear about any improvements that you would suggest to the intersection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=8031)|
| 2:13:56| If we approve this, what clout do we have to go back and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=8036)|
| 2:14:01| okay, you said you were going to improve the intersection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=8041)|
| 2:14:03| We want to make sure that it's improved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=8043)|
| 2:14:09| Well, Knox County Engineering has already signed off on the concept plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=8049)|
| 2:14:14| So as they consider the design plan, then,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=8054)|
| 2:14:18| that is the next step in the subdivision regulations process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=8058)|
| 2:14:22| they will see the improvements to that intersection and permit it accordingly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=8062)|
| 2:14:29| And then final plats won't be approved until the design| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=8069)|
| 2:14:35| and improvements have been put into place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=8075)|
| 2:14:38| So once they do the updated traffic study, will that come back to you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=8078)|
| 2:14:42| Yes, sir, it will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=8082)|
| 2:14:43| We'll get updated traffic study post-school opening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=8083)|
| 2:14:46| And just to clarify or to follow up on what Marcus said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=8086)|
| 2:14:49| we will actually undertake to make these improvements ourselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=8089)|
| 2:14:53| That would not ordinarily be the model, but in this particular case,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=8093)|
| 2:14:56| the developer is donating the real property that we need in order to realign the intersection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=8096)|
| 2:15:01| So it's an equitable exchange.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=8101)|
| 2:15:03| We'll handle design work and construction as part of the larger Carnage Connector project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=8103)|
| 2:15:09| as opposed to selling the property that we need in order to do this to the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=8109)|
| 2:15:15| When we've talked to the community about this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=8115)|
| 2:15:18| both in terms of phone calls that we've received| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=8118)|
| 2:15:20| and also in terms of the meeting we had at Carnage High School about the Carnage Connector project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=8120)|
| 2:15:25| if I could sort of break down, I think there were really two or three key concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=8125)|
| 2:15:30| Obviously, there is a sight distance intersection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=8130)|
| 2:15:32| and a sight distance issue at the intersection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=8132)|
| 2:15:34| and a turning movement issue at the intersection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=8134)|
| 2:15:37| Those will certainly be corrected by the work that's going to be done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=8137)|
| 2:15:41| as part of the overall project with Carnage Connector.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=8141)|
| 2:15:44| I don't think there's any question about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=8144)|
| 2:15:46| There is a second set of concerns that I think you're hearing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=8146)|
| 2:15:50| and certainly that we are hearing that have to do with capacity and width and traffic volumes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=8150)|
| 2:15:56| And there's not anything that we're doing in the realignment of the intersection that would speak to those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=8156)|
| 2:16:02| It will strictly improve conditions at the intersection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=8162)|
| 2:16:06| Certainly volumes are going to go up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=8166)|
| 2:16:08| and certainly Gray-Hendrix is going to continue to be narrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=8168)|
| 2:16:12| Longer term, and this I think is going to be important for everybody,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=8172)|
| 2:16:16| we're going to go back to market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=8176)|
| 2:16:17| In fact, this may be in front of commission next month for consulting services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=8177)|
| 2:16:22| to update our strategic road plan because the last time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=8182)|
| 2:16:25| that the strategic road plan was given a global look was 1997.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=8185)|
| 2:16:29| It has served us very well since that time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=8189)|
| 2:16:31| and many of the projects that we're working right now were predicated on recommendations from that study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=8191)|
| 2:16:38| But we are going back to market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=8198)|
| 2:16:40| And so within six months to a year, year and a half,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=8200)|
| 2:16:44| we will have an updated version of the master road plan or strategic road plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=8204)|
| 2:16:48| I would expect that the Garrison Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=8208)|
| 2:16:50| and Gray-Hendrix Road area will feature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=8210)|
| 2:16:53| I don't know where they'll feature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=8213)|
| 2:16:55| It will be based on capacity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=8215)|
| 2:16:56| It will be based on crash data.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=8216)|
| 2:16:58| It will be based on current size.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=8218)|
| 2:17:01| And those sorts of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=8221)|
| 2:17:02| So I wouldn't want to sit here and submit to you that I think this is going to somehow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=8222)|
| 2:17:06| or another fall top on the list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=8226)|
| 2:17:08| I just have no way of knowing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=8228)|
| 2:17:10| It might fall number one and it may fall somewhere down the list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=8230)|
| 2:17:13| But it will be given as part of an overall larger examination of our infrastructure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=8233)|
| 2:17:18| It will be given a look under the terms of this study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=8238)|
| 2:17:23| I think you've answered my questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=8243)|
| 2:17:25| You're welcome to speak if you would like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=8245)|
| 2:17:26| but I think he's pretty much answered what I have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=8246)|
| 2:17:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=8249)|
| 2:17:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=8252)|
| 2:17:33| Yes, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=8253)|
| 2:17:36| We've had a lot of discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=8256)|
| 2:17:37| We've had a lot of opposition on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=8257)|
| 2:17:38| but we've had a lot of great discussions with MPC, with staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=8258)|
| 2:17:41| engineering, with a lot of people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=8261)|
| 2:17:43| And I think if you look through the MPC minutes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=8263)|
| 2:17:46| they made it clear that we understand these concerns of the residents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=8266)|
| 2:17:51| but these improvements we feel will never get made| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=8271)|
| 2:17:54| and these roads will never get updated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=8274)|
| 2:17:56| unless we have more residents, more homeowners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=8276)|
| 2:18:01| more tax basis for Knox County to improve these roads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=8281)|
| 2:18:04| We donated the land to improve the intersection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=8284)|
| 2:18:08| We gave that to Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=8288)|
| 2:18:10| These streets will be lined with sidewalks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=8290)|
| 2:18:13| If I was a middle schooler and a parent of a middle schooler,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=8293)|
| 2:18:16| I can throw a rock and hit the middle school from the corner of this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=8296)|
| 2:18:20| I can't see anyone driving unless the weather was terrible, raining, cold, whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=8300)|
| 2:18:26| We just we've given up the density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=8306)|
| 2:18:29| We've done a lot of things to develop this property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=8309)|
| 2:18:31| and just make 185 new homes for residents and new families.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=8311)|
| 2:18:35| So we ask that you all approve this based on MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=8315)|
| 2:18:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=8319)|
| 2:18:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=8320)|
| 2:18:41| Mr. McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=8321)|
| 2:18:44| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=8324)|
| 2:18:45| You know, just this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=8325)|
| 2:18:47| I struggle with this one because, you know, I hear sidewalks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=8327)|
| 2:18:51| but I also know that reality is that very few kids are walking to school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=8331)|
| 2:18:58| I mean, you know, there was a day where sidewalks were used.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=8338)|
| 2:19:02| But, you know, I'll go to my backyard, Holston Middle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=8342)|
| 2:19:07| Sherwin-Bradwell went there when I was in high school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=8347)|
| 2:19:08| They have pretty much everyone in the neighborhood walking now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=8348)|
| 2:19:11| It's a traffic jam coming both directions, not just from the Gibbs area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=8351)|
| 2:19:15| but it's a traffic jam coming from east.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=8355)|
| 2:19:18| And there are folks walking, you know, within the parent responsibility zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=8358)|
| 2:19:22| So that piece, I just don't think someone's that kids en masse, parents en masse,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=8362)|
| 2:19:31| are going to let their elementary, middle school kids walk through another subdivision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=8371)|
| 2:19:37| through their subdivision, through another one to school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=8377)|
| 2:19:40| So, you know, again, these pictures are definitely compelling| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=8380)|
| 2:19:43| and but I do agree with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=8383)|
| 2:19:48| I mean, if you don't develop it, you're never going to get, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=8388)|
| 2:19:52| they're not going to expand the roads in that area just on a whim.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=8392)|
| 2:19:56| So I think we're going to end up be looking at Dwight with a harder eye, unfortunately,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=8396)|
| 2:20:02| to try to expand these roads on, you know, get the shoulders and whatnot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=8402)|
| 2:20:06| If this area really booms, we're going to be looking at some more than just that one intersection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=8406)|
| 2:20:11| We're going to be looking at more engineering to get this school zone where it can take this traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=8411)|
| 2:20:19| So, like I said, I'm struggling with this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=8419)|
| 2:20:23| But just wanted to kind of put those points out there for folks to consider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=8423)|
| 2:20:28| Mr. Anders?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=8428)|
| 2:20:29| Yeah, Dwight, we've spoken and we've talked about this for a couple of weeks, this particular.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=8429)|
| 2:20:35| I guess Mr. Sexton may be able to discuss this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=8435)|
| 2:20:39| This road here, what's the width on Garrison and Gray-Hendricks?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=8439)|
| 2:20:45| Did you look at that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=8445)|
| 2:20:47| I guess NBC looked at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=8447)|
| 2:20:49| What's the width on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=8449)|
| 2:20:51| John has some plans with him, Commissioner Anders, so I'll defer to him for specifics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=8451)|
| 2:21:03| I'm going to have to refer to the report because they spell out most all of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=8463)|
| 2:21:11| And I'm speed reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=8471)|
| 2:21:15| Gray-Hendricks Road is a local road, approximately 17 feet wide, 17 feet of pavement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=8475)|
| 2:21:21| That's quite narrow, and as they pointed out, no shoulders, no recovery area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=8481)|
| 2:21:27| You live in Carnes, don't you, Jim?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=8487)|
| 2:21:28| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=8488)|
| 2:21:29| There's not very many roads out there that are 22 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=8489)|
| 2:21:32| Common problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=8492)|
| 2:21:34| Mr. Law Director, you know, on a zoning issue, our hands are kind of tied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=8494)|
| 2:21:42| If NPC, if there's no legal reason to not turn down the zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=8502)|
| 2:21:49| it kind of puts us in a position where we have to approve a zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=8509)|
| 2:21:54| unless there's a legal or damaging reason not to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=8514)|
| 2:21:58| How's the wording of that read?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=8518)|
| 2:22:01| Well, there are specific requirements that the application has to meet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=8521)|
| 2:22:06| in order to be eligible for the rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=8526)|
| 2:22:09| And NPC has made a report that says that this one meets those qualifications,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=8529)|
| 2:22:14| subject to some conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=8534)|
| 2:22:15| And one of the conditions is that there be some road improvements made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=8535)|
| 2:22:20| And I think that addresses the concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=8540)|
| 2:22:24| And unless you hear competent proof to rebut that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=8544)|
| 2:22:29| then you can find that it meets the requirements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=8549)|
| 2:22:34| unless you find that it doesn't meet the requirements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=8554)|
| 2:22:36| and then would be injurious to the surrounding properties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=8556)|
| 2:22:41| is how you should look at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=8561)|
| 2:22:45| This road kind of reminds me of Beaver Ridge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=8565)|
| 2:22:47| which is behind the elementary school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=8567)|
| 2:22:51| We probably put 300 or 400 houses in there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=8571)|
| 2:22:54| and it was virtually the same size road, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=8574)|
| 2:22:57| Now we've had to build a sidewalk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=8577)|
| 2:22:59| So Ms. Pianchi, is she still here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=8579)|
| 2:23:02| She's not here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=8582)|
| 2:23:03| Is there any ñ has there been made any reference of taking ñ| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=8583)|
| 2:23:12| let me make sure I get the right road here ñ| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=8592)|
| 2:23:14| taking the road for the sidewalk for the other subdivision that was built?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=8594)|
| 2:23:18| I think the newer subdivision in front of the school has a sidewalk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=8598)|
| 2:23:21| Isn't there a sidewalk part of that subdivision?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=8601)|
| 2:23:24| I'm not that familiar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=8604)|
| 2:23:26| Is there any plans of sidewalks?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=8606)|
| 2:23:27| Has there been any discussion there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=8607)|
| 2:23:31| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=8611)|
| 2:23:32| There are sidewalks in the new subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=8612)|
| 2:23:35| Oh, really?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=8615)|
| 2:23:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=8616)|
| 2:23:37| And the engineer said sidewalks in the old subdivision will be installed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=8617)|
| 2:23:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=8621)|
| 2:23:42| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=8622)|
| 2:23:45| We have to hear you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=8625)|
| 2:23:46| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=8626)|
| 2:23:47| We were told at the previous meeting that there were no plans to widen Gray-Hendricks Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=8627)|
| 2:23:54| or put sidewalks alongside the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=8634)|
| 2:23:57| I know it's a great thing that you're going to have sidewalks in the subdivision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=8637)|
| 2:24:02| but that doesn't change the fact that we still have ñ and I know it's a small area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=8642)|
| 2:24:07| Let me tell you, I live next door to the Carters Middle School,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=8647)|
| 2:24:11| and I have one child that was special ed, rode a special ed bus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=8651)|
| 2:24:15| Her bus turned over on Gray-Hendricks Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=8655)|
| 2:24:18| The other two, I would not, even though I'm next door,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=8658)|
| 2:24:21| I would not let them get out on Gray-Hendricks Road and walk to school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=8661)|
| 2:24:24| We were in the parent responsibility zone, obviously, and we took it seriously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=8664)|
| 2:24:30| Very dangerous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=8670)|
| 2:24:35| Mr. Morrell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=8675)|
| 2:24:36| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=8676)|
| 2:24:37| Very quickly, two things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=8677)|
| 2:24:38| You mentioned a while ago, Buzz, that this would probably produce 98 students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=8678)|
| 2:24:45| I think the accepted per unit vehicle traffic per day is somewhere in the neighborhood of two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=8685)|
| 2:24:52| and a half, is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=8692)|
| 2:24:55| Well, the actual estimated traffic count, ADT, would be 1,826 vehicles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=8695)|
| 2:25:02| That's a whole lot more cars than 98 students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=8702)|
| 2:25:06| But the thing that bothers me is that the developer's statement he made earlier, which I've seen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=8706)|
| 2:25:13| I've seen it on MPC and so has Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=8713)|
| 2:25:16| When a developer comes to me with an attitude of I'm going to build it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=8716)|
| 2:25:21| and then let the county take care of the infrastructure later,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=8721)|
| 2:25:24| that turns me off quicker than anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=8724)|
| 2:25:27| If you're going to be part of the community, you need to be part of the solution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=8727)|
| 2:25:34| And this is off the subject, but our resolution we need to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=8734)|
| 2:25:39| we're going to have to leave for a board meeting here, about half of them in ten minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=8739)|
| 2:25:44| So if we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=8744)|
| 2:25:46| After this is over, we'll take them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=8746)|
| 2:25:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=8748)|
| 2:25:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=8749)|
| 2:25:51| Any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=8751)|
| 2:25:58| Mr. Henders?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=8758)|
| 2:25:59| Well, I'm trying to think if we need a potential delay here not to kill the project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=8759)|
| 2:26:05| but try to have more discussion about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=8765)|
| 2:26:08| I don't know how.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=8768)|
| 2:26:09| I mean, I can read the tea leaves here, and I think if it's voted on, I think it's gone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=8769)|
| 2:26:14| I mean, I'm just thinking to myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=8774)|
| 2:26:16| But if the developer wants to continue the process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=8776)|
| 2:26:20| and I don't know if I can offer a substitute motion on my own motion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=8780)|
| 2:26:23| but I guess I can change my motion to have a one-month delay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=8783)|
| 2:26:29| Mr. McKenzie, would you like to make a substitute motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=8789)|
| 2:26:32| I'd like to make a substitute motion that we delay this item to next month's meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=8792)|
| 2:26:37| I'll second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=8797)|
| 2:26:40| Is that enough time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=8800)|
| 2:26:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=8801)|
| 2:26:42| Next month's meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=8802)|
| 2:26:43| Would you like to respond, sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=8803)|
| 2:26:45| I wasn't trying to offend anyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=8805)|
| 2:26:46| That wasn't the attitude I was trying to have with letting the county take care of it later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=8806)|
| 2:26:52| But what I do want to say is this tract of land, it meets the sector county code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=8812)|
| 2:27:01| It falls in the sector of five units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=8821)|
| 2:27:03| We're doing the 3.25 units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=8823)|
| 2:27:06| We're trying to develop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=8826)|
| 2:27:07| We're going to phase this thing out where we're going to do, I think, 60 homes in the first phase| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=8827)|
| 2:27:13| and then a year from now and a year from now, so it's not going to be all at once.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=8833)|
| 2:27:16| It's not going to be overwhelming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=8836)|
| 2:27:17| As far as the sidewalks on Gray-Hendrix, once this development goes in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=8837)|
| 2:27:21| you won't ever need to walk around the curve of Gray-Hendrix or Garrison or Gray-Hendrix.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=8841)|
| 2:27:25| You can walk through the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=8845)|
| 2:27:27| They'll connect both ends.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=8847)|
| 2:27:28| We have multiple entrances and multiple exits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=8848)|
| 2:27:34| This is going to be great for the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=8854)|
| 2:27:36| And as far as widening, everything that touches us, we'll be more than happy to beef up the shoulders| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=8856)|
| 2:27:41| and beef up as long as Knox County will work with Knox County and get everything to spec.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=8861)|
| 2:27:45| But we'll be more than happy to beef up the shoulder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=8865)|
| 2:27:48| Even the widening of roads is not going to improve the traffic flow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=8868)|
| 2:27:53| Like they're saying, buses might pass and everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=8873)|
| 2:27:55| We will beef up on our side and be more than happy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=8875)|
| 2:27:57| We will be the solution on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=8877)|
| 2:28:00| Guys postponing us right now, interest rates are going up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=8880)|
| 2:28:03| It's going to take us, with the last 12 months of weather we've had,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=8883)|
| 2:28:08| it's taken us a long time to develop the 42 lots across the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=8888)|
| 2:28:12| Postponing us right now with interest rates the way they're going and money and everything else,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=8892)|
| 2:28:17| we need to move forward now so we can develop this track and we can get it in as fast as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=8897)|
| 2:28:21| There's not – I don't know if you all drove – I mean, when I drove to work this morning, every school zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=8901)|
| 2:28:28| I hit Sacred Heart, I hit Cedar Bluff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=8908)|
| 2:28:31| There's not a good traffic flow in any school zone in this county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=8911)|
| 2:28:38| And, unfortunately, this one just is a little worse than others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=8918)|
| 2:28:41| But we ask that we move forward and we go ahead and get this approved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=8921)|
| 2:28:45| and we can go ahead and develop the first phase of 60 homes with amenities, with sidewalks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=8925)|
| 2:28:49| with everything for this property and for these homeowners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=8929)|
| 2:28:53| I'd like to rescind my substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=8933)|
| 2:29:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=8941)|
| 2:29:02| So we're back to our original motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=8942)|
| 2:29:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=8945)|
| 2:29:06| Mr. Anders, do you have something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=8946)|
| 2:29:07| Well, I was going to – when we were voting on the delay, I was going to – if Jim's not here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=8947)|
| 2:29:12| Jim and I, Jim Snowden, we've had conversation about looking into, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=8952)|
| 2:29:17| widening, adding a foot or so on each side of the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=8957)|
| 2:29:21| And so I'm telling you, I'm giving you fair warning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=8961)|
| 2:29:24| If you don't want a delay, I mean, if you don't want Jim and I to sit down and talk about it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=8964)|
| 2:29:31| I don't think this commission's – if they turn you down, you're waiting 12 months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=8971)|
| 2:29:36| Is that not the rule, Buzz?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=8976)|
| 2:29:38| I mean, if we turn it down or if we don't approve it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=8978)|
| 2:29:41| he has 12 months before he can reapply for the same zoning?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=8981)|
| 2:29:44| Yeah, we would accept a different request at MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=8984)|
| 2:29:49| I'm not telling you how to run your business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=8989)|
| 2:29:52| but I'm trying to mediate between you and Knox County Engineering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=8992)|
| 2:29:56| and this commission that a delay would be in your best interest right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=8996)|
| 2:30:00| because I don't see – I don't see six votes up here for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=9000)|
| 2:30:04| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=9004)|
| 2:30:05| And you can take that chance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=9005)|
| 2:30:07| But if you'll allow me 30 days to talk to Jim Snowden and see what it's going to cost to beef up those two roads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=9007)|
| 2:30:13| And, no, it's not going to improve school traffic because Carnes Elementary is in the same position,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=9013)|
| 2:30:18| but it may allow for safer travels without adding the 1,800 cars a day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=9018)|
| 2:30:23| I'm just – you can do what you – you know, I mean, right now there's not a motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=9023)|
| 2:30:28| I could change my motion to a delay, but I think you're burning bridges that you don't need to burn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=9028)|
| 2:30:34| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=9034)|
| 2:30:35| I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=9035)|
| 2:30:36| I just – I'm just confused about postponing another 30 days based on staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=9036)|
| 2:30:42| and any of the other Knox County engineers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=9042)|
| 2:30:45| The solution is improving this intersection at Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=9045)|
| 2:30:49| and we're going to work with them to – we've already given them, designated this right away to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=9049)|
| 2:30:54| So the solution is this intersection, widening the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=9054)|
| 2:30:58| And we'll be more than happy to, like I said, beef up the road on our side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=9058)|
| 2:31:02| And we're going to install stop signs and everything else on the other garrison| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=9062)|
| 2:31:07| and Gray-Hendricks intersection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=9067)|
| 2:31:11| I don't see what –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=9071)|
| 2:31:12| Is it going to be a three-way stop?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=9072)|
| 2:31:14| It will be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=9074)|
| 2:31:15| Right there, garrison.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=9075)|
| 2:31:19| There's a –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=9079)|
| 2:31:20| My name is Gabby, 4909 Ball Road, Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=9080)|
| 2:31:25| As far as I am the engineer, we did the intersection layout,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=9085)|
| 2:31:30| and Knox County engineers already started the design.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=9090)|
| 2:31:34| And I gave them my layout.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=9094)|
| 2:31:35| I think if you have a layout, you will look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=9095)|
| 2:31:38| The road will be – the Hendricks road will be straight with no stop sign,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=9098)|
| 2:31:43| will be teed with the garrison road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=9103)|
| 2:31:46| And the intersection will be finished by the spring next year before our –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=9106)|
| 2:31:51| any development in hours will be done by then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=9111)|
| 2:31:55| If I understood you correctly, you said the intersection would not be a three-way stop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=9115)|
| 2:31:59| It would be a teed intersection?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=9119)|
| 2:32:00| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=9120)|
| 2:32:01| And wouldn't –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=9121)|
| 2:32:02| That's how they asked us to do it, and that's how we designed it for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=9122)|
| 2:32:03| And also nothing would be developed until you did the intersection?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=9123)|
| 2:32:07| The intersection would be done before in our development, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=9127)|
| 2:32:14| Mr. Hammond?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=9134)|
| 2:32:16| I just wanted to say that if we're going to be voting on it, I'll be voting no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=9136)|
| 2:32:20| And I'll be voting no not because I'm against the development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=9140)|
| 2:32:23| because I see that it's, you know, we're going to have development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=9143)|
| 2:32:28| But by his own admission, he said that the school area here was worse than most in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=9148)|
| 2:32:35| I believe those are your exact words.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=9155)|
| 2:32:37| Well, if we're looking at a school zone that is the worst in Knox County by the developer's own admission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=9157)|
| 2:32:43| I think 30 days gives us time to take a look at traffic because they did a traffic count| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=9163)|
| 2:32:48| when the school wasn't in session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=9168)|
| 2:32:50| And so, to me, I would rather take an extra 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=9170)|
| 2:32:54| I don't see interest rates jumping considerably in 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=9174)|
| 2:32:57| And I understand the need to, you know, get in and get the money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=9177)|
| 2:33:01| But I also want to make sure that if, by his own admission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=9181)|
| 2:33:05| if this is the worst or one of the worst school zones or school things in Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=9185)|
| 2:33:11| that 30 days is going to give us time to get together with traffic engineering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=9191)|
| 2:33:15| to figure out how this is going to impact them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=9195)|
| 2:33:18| I don't have to drive that road because I live across the river in South Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=9198)|
| 2:33:21| But these folks do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=9201)|
| 2:33:23| And so, if they're having to drive it every day, I want to be respectful to them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=9203)|
| 2:33:27| and say, well, let's get the best plan we can get for you that have to drive that road every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=9207)|
| 2:33:32| So, if we have to vote on it, I'm going to vote no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=9212)|
| 2:33:34| But I would prefer a delay so that we can take a look at it because, again, I'm not against your development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=9214)|
| 2:33:40| But just from what I've heard today, I just think that we need a little bit more information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=9220)|
| 2:33:45| Delay sounds great to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=9225)|
| 2:33:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=9228)|
| 2:33:49| We have to have a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=9229)|
| 2:33:50| I'd like to change my motion, my original motion, to a 30-day delay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=9230)|
| 2:33:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=9233)|
| 2:33:54| Hang on a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=9234)|
| 2:33:55| Do we have any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=9235)|
| 2:33:57| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=9237)|
| 2:33:58| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=9238)|
| 2:33:59| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=9239)|
| 2:34:00| Ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=9240)|
| 2:34:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=9241)|
| 2:34:02| Good luck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=9242)|
| 2:34:03| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=9243)|
| 2:34:04| Now we have our honorary resolution that we want to go ahead with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=9244)|
| 2:34:09| Thank you for waiting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=9249)|
| 2:34:13| Madam Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=9253)|
| 2:34:14| Daniel, do you want to come down and stand with your friends?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=9254)|
| 2:34:18| Daniel has friends?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=9258)|
| 2:34:20| They don't recognize you with a tie on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=9260)|
| 2:34:23| All the members of the bike club, come on down with Drew if you would, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=9263)|
| 2:34:29| While they're coming, if you don't know, this is an amazing group of people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=9269)|
| 2:34:36| Over the last few years, they have whittled out, carved out, chopped out, walked out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=9276)|
| 2:34:42| stomped on, built up over 30 miles of hiking, biking trails across the river.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=9282)|
| 2:34:49| And it's an amazing feat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=9289)|
| 2:34:51| Today we're here to honor one of their group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=9291)|
| 2:34:54| And I'll tell you who can attest to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=9294)|
| 2:34:57| Dwight, Roy, and Tom Salter, if he was still here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=9297)|
| 2:35:01| they can tell you how many tons of garbage these folks picked up along Burnish Creek Road up there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=9301)|
| 2:35:08| It's been an amazing, amazing effort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=9308)|
| 2:35:10| As I say, today we're here to honor one of their group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=9310)|
| 2:35:14| Drew, come forward here, my man.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=9314)|
| 2:35:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=9317)|
| 2:35:18| I don't know how you can sit down yet because, as you notice,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=9318)|
| 2:35:24| I'm going to ask Ms. Angie Shewwood or Sandra to read the proclamation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=9324)|
| 2:35:29| and then I'll have another couple of words.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=9329)|
| 2:35:31| You got a copy of it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=9331)|
| 2:35:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=9333)|
| 2:35:34| We need a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=9334)|
| 2:35:35| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=9335)|
| 2:35:36| And a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=9336)|
| 2:35:37| I'll make the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=9337)|
| 2:35:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=9338)|
| 2:35:39| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=9339)|
| 2:35:40| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=9340)|
| 2:35:41| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=9341)|
| 2:35:42| Ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=9342)|
| 2:35:43| Would you read it into the record, Madam Clerk?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=9343)|
| 2:35:45| A resolution of the Commission of Knox County, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=9345)|
| 2:35:47| honoring Drew McIntosh for completing the 2013 Tour Divide mountain bike race,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=9347)|
| 2:35:52| whereas Drew McIntosh is a resident of South Knoxville in the 9th District of Knox County, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130826?start=9352)|
