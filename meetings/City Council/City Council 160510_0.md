| 0:00:00| Okay, good evening everyone. Thank you for being here. This is Knoxville City Council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=0)|
| 0:00:06| on Tuesday, May 10, 2016. Appreciate everybody who's here with us and anybody who might be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=6)|
| 0:00:12| watching from home. We will start with the invocation given by Councilman Della Vopi| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=12)|
| 0:00:18| and then the pledge will be led by Councilman Graves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=18)|
| 0:00:26| Thank you for this day in East Tennessee as we enjoy the springtime and thank you for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=26)|
| 0:00:32| the opportunity that we have received to serve our community. We ask that you help us to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=32)|
| 0:00:39| listen to those who come before us to debate the merits of projects that are before us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=39)|
| 0:00:45| and to act as best we can in the community's best interest. Also, we pray that you help| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=45)|
| 0:00:53| us work with our youth to turn around violence and to help young people learn to get good| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=53)|
| 0:01:00| educations and to progress in their lives rather than to self-destruct. We also ask| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=60)|
| 0:01:07| that you help us be ever mindful of those less fortunate than ourselves. Amen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=67)|
| 0:01:15| I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the republic for which it stands, one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=75)|
| 0:01:29| Roll Mr. Johnson. Councilman Brown. Here. Councilman Campin. Here. Councilman Della Vopi. Here. Vice Mayor Graves. Here. Councilwoman Palmer. Here. Councilman Pavlis. Here. Councilman Saunders. Here. Councilman Starr. Here. Councilman Wallace. Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=89)|
| 0:01:49| Okay, we're all here tonight. Is there a motion to approve the minutes? So moved. Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=109)|
| 0:01:57| And a second. All in favor say aye. Aye. Any opposed? Minutes are approved. Are there any items to be withdrawn? Councilman Starr? I have an item to be postponed. Okay, well, let's go ahead and do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=117)|
| 0:02:11| Thank you, Mayor. I move to postpone item 12F for two weeks. This is a street renaming and there was a little mix-up between MPC and Council. It's actually supposed to be reviewed by the Public Property Naming Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=131)|
| 0:02:26| I've spoke with the applicant, so he's not here tonight, but he was fine with it. The Public Property Naming Committee is meeting on May 18th in this room at 530, and this item is being put on that agenda, so that would be the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=146)|
| 0:02:43| Second. Okay, any discussion? All in favor say aye. Aye. Any opposed? That item is postponed. Councilman Pavlis. Yes, Mayor, I'd like to ask for a postponement of 12H for...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=163)|
| 0:02:59| What is that? The alternative finance? Yeah, for the end of June meeting. I don't know the exact date on that. For four weeks, then, otherwise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=179)|
| 0:03:13| We've got a lot of things coming at us with the budget, and that's been on the forefront for all of us. This is a first time, so we want to make sure that all the T's are crossed and the I's dotted on this before we move forward, so I'd like to make that motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=193)|
| 0:03:32| So that's June 21st. With the hopes of perhaps, Vice Mayor, if we can ask for, take a roll call for a workshop. We will. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=212)|
| 0:03:45| The workshop would be when, Will? June 16th. So we are postponing 12H until June 21st. That's my motion. Okay, we have a second. Any discussion? All in favor say aye. Aye. Any opposed? That is postponed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=225)|
| 0:04:04| Anything else for postponement? Anything to be added by motion? Consent items are 11N through AK, which are certificates of compliance, and 12Q through U are 202s. Move to approve. Second. Any discussion? All in favor say aye. Aye. Any opposed? Ayes have it, and those are approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=244)|
| 0:04:25| So for the Mayor's report, first we have a Boy Scout troop here, Troop 55 from Fountain City. Would you please stand so we can recognize you? And they are finishing their citizenship and the community badge. Thank you so much for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=265)|
| 0:04:40| I want to say thank you to everyone who came out for the State of the City address and the budget presentation. It's always great to see so many people who are interested in that and getting the update on our city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=280)|
| 0:04:59| And also I want to thank Zoo Knoxville and particularly Einstein for hosting us at the Zoo and for helping me with my acknowledgments and recognitions. And just to reiterate the budget process from here, Council will be voting tonight on first reading of the proposed budget, which will then be followed by a Council budget hearing next Tuesday, the 17th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=299)|
| 0:05:21| And then there will be a second reading, I hope, at a subsequent Council meeting. For anyone out there who hasn't had a chance to review the proposed budget yet, you can find all the information on our website at KnoxvilleTN.gov slash budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=321)|
| 0:05:37| Tomorrow at 2 p.m. I'd like to invite everyone to join me and representatives of KCDC for a groundbreaking at the Residences at Five Points, which is a new 90-unit affordable housing development for seniors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=337)|
| 0:05:52| This apartment complex is at the corner of Bethel Avenue and McConnell Street in East Knoxville, Mayor Brown's district. It's an important addition to our housing efforts because we all know that we have an aging population and there is a real need for more affordable housing options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=352)|
| 0:06:07| Again, that is at 2 p.m. tomorrow, May 11th, at the corner of Bethel Avenue and McConnell Street. And this is part of KCDC's larger master plan for the revitalization of Walter P. Taylor homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=367)|
| 0:06:20| This Saturday, May 14th, we'll begin a summer-long series of open houses at our local fire stations. The first one will be from 9 a.m. to 1 p.m. at Fire Station Number 4, which is located at 2300 Linden Avenue in East Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=380)|
| 0:06:36| Everyone is welcome to come and tour the station. You can also get CPR training. Will you be doing that yourself? You'll be there? From our firefighters, you can get your blood pressure checked and practice fire extinguishing techniques and learn general smoke and fire safety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=396)|
| 0:06:53| This is a great program that highlights our fire stations and our community as community assets. And I want to thank Chief Sharp and all of his crew for opening their doors and providing this first one. And there'll be more to our community. Again, that's this Saturday from 9 a.m. to 1 p.m. at Station Number 4, 2300 Linden Avenue. And again, keep an eye out for future open houses at other fire stations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=413)|
| 0:07:18| Some good news from our law department. Devin Lyon, one of our newest and youngest staff attorneys, recently received some international recognition. Where's Devin? Come on down, Devin. Come on down there to the podium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=438)|
| 0:07:32| Imagine you all know that our law department does a huge amount of work with just a small staff. Just to give you some idea, last year alone, the department prepared or reviewed more than 620 resolutions and ordinances for council's consideration, prepared more than 468 contracts and or amendments to existing contracts, and resolved more than 198 cases pending in the courts against the City of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=452)|
| 0:08:00| So last month, the International Municipal Lawyers Association recognized Devin for his work on one case with its amicus service award. This was an amicus brief he prepared in the case of the Tennessean v. Metropolitan Government of Nashville on behalf of the IMLA and the Tennessee Municipal Attorneys Association. Metro Nashville won that case at the State Supreme Court, so Devin's brief must have been a good one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=480)|
| 0:08:30| Congratulations, Devin, and we appreciate the work that you do. I know I have to sign a lot of those things that you work on. I know you are very productive, and I'd like to ask our law director, Charles Swanson, if he wants to add anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=510)|
| 0:08:45| I just wanted to congratulate Devin on this award. It's certainly well-deserved, and Devin doesn't get recognized as much as he probably should for all the hard work he does up there. So we're grateful to have him up there, and congratulations on winning this award.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=525)|
| 0:08:59| Man, a few words. All right, thank you. And a lawyer, too, Charles said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=539)|
| 0:09:15| As I announced in my budget address, we are proposing $200,000 for traffic calming measures to control speeding on neighborhood streets. Pending council's approval, of course, these funds will be spent under our new Neighborhood Traffic Safety Program, which is now out for public comment. So Devin Massey from the Office of Neighborhoods is here to talk about the program in upcoming public meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=555)|
| 0:09:38| Thank you, Mayor. It is no secret that speeding is a big problem in our residential neighborhoods. We hear about it in the Office of Neighborhoods, you hear about it in the mayor's office, council members hear about it, engineering hears about it, and we are very glad to be able to introduce a new traffic safety program, the Neighborhood Traffic Safety Program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=578)|
| 0:10:00| It is a comprehensive approach to concerns about speeding on neighborhood streets. The program has three parts. It will incorporate the Knoxville Police Department's existing program for enhanced speed enforcement. It will introduce a new neighborhood-guided and neighborhood-centric education program, and finally, deploy traffic calming measures on streets that qualify for such measures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=600)|
| 0:10:26| Things like speed humps, traffic circles, as well as roadway modifications. Our tentative plans for this are contained in a 25-page program guide that's available on the website at knoxvilletn.gov forward slash traffic safety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=626)|
| 0:10:47| We are requesting public input through the end of May. Citizens can provide ideas and feedback in several ways. We have two public meetings coming up in the next week. The first one is this coming Thursday night at 5.30 at the O'Connor Senior Center on Winona, and the next one is at 7 p.m. at the West High School Small Auditorium on Sutherland Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=647)|
| 0:11:18| We also have an online survey, and people can also email us at traffic.calming at knoxvilletn.gov. All of that information is available on the website, again, knoxvilletn.gov forward slash traffic safety, or by calling my phone number, 215-3232, and I can provide hard copies of both the program guide as well as the survey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=678)|
| 0:11:46| We just want to urge citizens to come out and participate in this. We hope to launch in midsummer, and we're excited about getting going and getting our neighborhoods more safe with regard to traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=706)|
| 0:11:58| Great. Thank you so much. Thanks, David.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=718)|
| 0:12:00| And finally, last but not least, May is National Preservation Month, and we have two guests here, two friends, I should say, to say a few things about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=720)|
| 0:12:09| First, Kaye Graybeal, who is the Historic Preservation Planner for MPC, has her annual report on preservation in Knoxville, and then Kim Trent is here from Knox Heritage to talk about some upcoming events. Kaye?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=729)|
| 0:12:23| Good evening, Mayor O'Hara and council members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=743)|
| 0:12:27| Each year, MPC presents, and Historic Zoning Commission presents, an Historic Zoning and Historic Preservation Annual Report as required by the city charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=747)|
| 0:12:41| It was amended in 2002 to require this, and the purpose of this report is to convey the current state of historic preservation efforts and activities within the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=761)|
| 0:12:51| The topics include wins as well as losses. It includes initiatives in historic preservation, recommendations for implementation of preservation initiatives, and historic zoning commission activity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=771)|
| 0:13:02| I just wanted to highlight some of the initiatives taken by the city over the last year, the calendar year of 2015.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=782)|
| 0:13:11| The City Historic Preservation Fund is continued from the year before, from the prior year, as city council approved a $500,000 preservation fund to support historic preservation projects in need of gap funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=791)|
| 0:13:26| The city's community development department administers this fund, and we're in the process of reviewing the final stages of reviewing those applications for 2016.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=806)|
| 0:13:39| The Demolition by Neglect Ordinance was again last year funded at $100,000, and this ordinance allows the city to order repairs on endangered properties with historic designation and to utilize lanes to gain reimbursement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=819)|
| 0:13:54| These funds have been more recently utilized to address properties owned by absentee landlords and other types of properties within residential districts as well as commercial districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=834)|
| 0:14:07| The MPC was the recipient of a Tennessee Historic Preservation Fund grant this year to update the historic resource inventory, and that update is underway as of March 2016.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=847)|
| 0:14:20| This grant was obtained by MPC through the Tennessee Historical Commission using federal funds as well as a city historic preservation grant for the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=860)|
| 0:14:32| The original resource for our historic properties was completed in 1986, and it hasn't been updated comprehensively since 1993.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=872)|
| 0:14:41| Since then, a lot of properties have become more historic and perhaps their status has changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=881)|
| 0:14:48| They've either been demolished or either they've become more historic as they age, so we need to update our inventory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=888)|
| 0:14:56| One of the main goals of the inventory is to include properties that were constructed between the mid-1930s and around 1936 to 1966 because the last survey left off in 1936.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=896)|
| 0:15:09| I think a lot of folks are unaware that properties from that era do have historic significance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=909)|
| 0:15:14| It's kind of hard to believe since they were built during some of the lifetimes of many of us in this room,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=914)|
| 0:15:19| but those are important properties to consider as we go forward implementing these initiatives by the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=919)|
| 0:15:26| The Demolition Delay Ordinance was an amendment that was adopted in May 2015.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=926)|
| 0:15:34| Council approved including this in our ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=934)|
| 0:15:39| It regards the review of demolition of residential structures built before 1865.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=939)|
| 0:15:44| Also, there's a process for that in which council must approve that demolition or have the opportunity to acquire the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=944)|
| 0:15:52| There's also a 60-day delay for other identified properties of local or national historic significance that are included in the survey update but may not be officially designated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=952)|
| 0:16:03| The intent is to encourage property owners to seek alternatives to demolition of historic structures| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=963)|
| 0:16:11| and to establish demolition delay periods to provide an opportunity to negotiate a preservation solution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=971)|
| 0:16:18| During the past year, the code has been implemented at least twice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=978)|
| 0:16:22| The first delay was at 120-122 Central Street in the Old City.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=982)|
| 0:16:28| This was for structures that they eventually were deemed to not be historically significant and they had been demolished.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=988)|
| 0:16:37| The site is being prepared for redevelopment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=997)|
| 0:16:40| The second delay is for a rare intact shotgun house on 140 West Anderson Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=1000)|
| 0:16:46| The 60-day delay has run out for this structure, but it has not yet been demolished.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=1006)|
| 0:16:52| Just to go over the main action items for 2016 are to implement the Historic Preservation Fund grant from the Tennessee Historical Commission and the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=1012)|
| 0:17:02| to update the Historic Resource Survey, to continue to utilize the demo by neglect funds that would otherwise be described as proactive preservation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=1022)|
| 0:17:11| for structures in both residential and commercial districts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=1031)|
| 0:17:15| and also there was a resolution by council to research potential expansion of the Edgewood Park City Historic District Overlay based on the National Register boundaries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=1035)|
| 0:17:26| Those are some of the main initiatives for the year 2016 for staff to implement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=1046)|
| 0:17:35| I just wanted to go over very briefly a few of the properties that are highlighted in this report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=1055)|
| 0:17:42| I would like to just return to my station to be able to do that if I could with a quick PowerPoint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=1062)|
| 0:18:12| Is this on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=1092)|
| 0:18:36| The wonders of technology.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=1116)|
| 0:18:40| There we go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=1120)|
| 0:18:51| Can you all hear me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=1131)|
| 0:18:52| Can you hear me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=1132)|
| 0:18:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=1133)|
| 0:18:55| Knox Heritage does a good job with their fragile 15 list, so I won't spend a lot of time on these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=1135)|
| 0:19:00| I did want to highlight just a few of the properties real quick that are in your report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=1140)|
| 0:19:05| Some may overlap those of Knox Heritage, but as we know, the Howard House on Broadway, that status is still up in the air.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=1145)|
| 0:19:14| The Knoxville College is severely blighted, and there aren't funds to keep the college open, so that's an issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=1154)|
| 0:19:21| The Eugenia Williams House owned by UT is caught up in some legalities that are an issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=1161)|
| 0:19:30| The Standard Knitting Mill is still sitting vacant and for lack of any solid proposals for redevelopment at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=1170)|
| 0:19:38| And the Prior Brown parking garage, as we all know, is another threatened property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=1178)|
| 0:19:44| The properties that were actually demolished last year were the Christenberry House on Kingston Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=1184)|
| 0:19:49| It was not protected with a historic overlay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=1189)|
| 0:19:52| And the owner looked in, had agreed to look into preservation, but decided that that could not be carried out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=1192)|
| 0:20:02| The Pickle Mansion up in Fort Sanders on Clinch Avenue we lost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=1202)|
| 0:20:06| We lost two houses in the 1300 block of White Avenue to an expansion by UT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=1206)|
| 0:20:13| However, we were able to get the house known as Three Chimneys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=1213)|
| 0:20:18| One of those three moved over from White Avenue to Clinch Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=1218)|
| 0:20:23| Carl Lansdow won a preservation award for being able to pull that off, so that house is currently under renovation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=1223)|
| 0:20:30| And then we had one house that was nominated to the National Register in the 5700 block of Lions View Pike, referred to as Hilltop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=1230)|
| 0:20:40| And that application was submitted by Dorothy and Cesar Stare.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=1240)|
| 0:20:45| Those are just a few of the houses highlighted in the report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=1245)|
| 0:20:49| I wanted to get to the most positive part of the report and just highlight some of the redevelopment projects| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=1249)|
| 0:20:55| that have been reviewed by the Historic Zoning Commission over the past few years, about the past five years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=1255)|
| 0:21:01| At 1601 Western Avenue, this building is included in the Mechanicsville Historic District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=1261)|
| 0:21:07| And the Historic Zoning Commission last year reviewed and approved renovations to this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=1267)|
| 0:21:13| Hatcher Hill says that they've invested a million dollars in this property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=1273)|
| 0:21:17| and that their property taxes will at least more than double, and this will create a greater revenue stream for the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=1277)|
| 0:21:25| Kearns Bakery Building is under renovation, as we all know, by Dewhurst Properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=1285)|
| 0:21:30| This was also reviewed last year by the Historic Zoning Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=1290)|
| 0:21:34| and approved for partial demolitions and some of the additions and window repairs and replacements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=1294)|
| 0:21:42| 32 Market Square, we may remember what that looked like, is now called Scruffy City Hall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=1302)|
| 0:21:49| The West say that they have invested over a million dollars in a couple of the buildings there on Market Square.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=1309)|
| 0:21:58| Over the past ten years, they've owned several buildings, and their property taxes have increased tenfold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=1318)|
| 0:22:04| However, the revenue that these properties have generated from them has enabled them to continue investing in the square,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=1324)|
| 0:22:11| sort of creating a ripple effect of other investments in security in the square.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=1331)|
| 0:22:17| Knoxville High School, again, the Historic Zoning Commission will be reviewing window replacement and other repairs to this building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=1337)|
| 0:22:24| And although the property taxes are currently based on a $500,000 valuation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=1344)|
| 0:22:30| that will increase two and a half times over the next 13 years or so and become a $225,000 a year property taxes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=1350)|
| 0:22:39| after the developer plans to invest $12.5 million in capital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=1359)|
| 0:22:44| This is anticipated to create 35 jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=1364)|
| 0:22:48| As we all know, the jobs then have a ripple effect into the economy of the community with a $1 million payroll.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=1368)|
| 0:22:55| And this is estimated to put $2.5 million back into the local and regional economy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=1375)|
| 0:23:01| This project will incorporate state and federal tax credits as well as a pilot to use for gap funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=1381)|
| 0:23:07| And the regulatory process is geared towards review and facilitating redevelopment of this historic building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=1387)|
| 0:23:15| include both incentives and regulatory design review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=1395)|
| 0:23:20| The developer, Rick Dover, has said about the city, Knoxville has done a good job of balancing all that out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=1400)|
| 0:23:25| He's referring to the use of appropriate tools and regulatory review to facilitate important projects such as this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=1405)|
| 0:23:35| Another project that the Historic Zoning Commission recently reviewed was the 100 block of East Jackson Avenue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=1415)|
| 0:23:42| for exterior renovations to that series of buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=1422)|
| 0:23:47| And this is the anticipated result.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=1427)|
| 0:23:50| And then we also have reviewed a couple of years ago or about three years ago the Walker-Sherrill House on Kingston Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=1430)|
| 0:23:57| Here you see it relative to the sports academy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=1437)|
| 0:24:00| It is a commercial property, formerly a residential house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=1440)|
| 0:24:04| Bill Hodges, the developer, invested $800,000 in this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=1444)|
| 0:24:08| It was basically abandoned and not generating any property taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=1448)|
| 0:24:12| He relays that he is assured of a very reasonable return in cash flow on the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=1452)|
| 0:24:16| given there have been more than several professional firms interested in leasing or purchasing the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=1456)|
| 0:24:22| So the buildings I've just highlighted for you are those that have been reviewed by the Historic Zoning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=1462)|
| 0:24:27| And I think sometimes we forget that the commission doesn't just review residential properties and historic districts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=1467)|
| 0:24:33| but also individual commercial buildings and commercial districts as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=1473)|
| 0:24:40| And I think that the few that I've shown highlight some very successful redevelopment projects| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=1480)|
| 0:24:47| in the city reviewed by the Historic Zoning Commission over the past five years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=1487)|
| 0:24:51| That concludes the report. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=1491)|
| 0:24:53| Thank you, Kay. Very good report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=1493)|
| 0:24:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=1496)|
| 0:25:03| I'm Kim Trent, Executive Director of Knox Heritage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=1503)|
| 0:25:06| And yes, it is Preservation Month 2016.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=1506)|
| 0:25:11| This year's theme is This Place Matters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=1511)|
| 0:25:14| So I'll be tracking some of you down this month to get your pictures in front of places that you think that matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=1514)|
| 0:25:20| I'm going to get Councilwoman Palmer at Westview Cemetery District later this month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=1520)|
| 0:25:25| So be on the lookout.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=1525)|
| 0:25:27| We celebrate this every year as a way to educate people about preservation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=1527)|
| 0:25:31| as well as have educational opportunities and fun times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=1531)|
| 0:25:35| So this month we are presenting this weekend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=1535)|
| 0:25:38| It's free at Westwood on Saturday at 10 a.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=1538)|
| 0:25:42| A Preservation Network session on heritage plants complete with a seed swap.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=1542)|
| 0:25:47| So please come to Historic Westwood at 10 a.m. Saturday morning for this free event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=1547)|
| 0:25:51| On Monday we will announce our 2016 Fragile 15 list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=1551)|
| 0:25:56| We will be announcing it at Oakwood Senior Living in the Oakwood-Lincoln Park neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=1556)|
| 0:26:01| You'll remember that that was declared a goner many years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=1561)|
| 0:26:05| and Rick Dover stepped in and converted that into a very productive space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=1565)|
| 0:26:10| And we're having it there to show that even the most dire situations can be turned around| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=1570)|
| 0:26:15| and result in an investment in the community and saving our heritage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=1575)|
| 0:26:20| We have free lunch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=1580)|
| 0:26:21| You didn't think there were free lunches, but there is one existing on May 20th| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=1581)|
| 0:26:24| at Historic Westwood at 1130, our Lost and Found Lunch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=1584)|
| 0:26:28| Jack Neely, the executive director of the Knoxville History Project, and myself| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=1588)|
| 0:26:32| will be discussing the history of preservation in Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=1592)|
| 0:26:35| which goes back much further than you think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=1595)|
| 0:26:37| On the 27th, we want to invite all of you out as we unveil the signage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=1597)|
| 0:26:42| at the Westview Historic Cemetery District in the Westview community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=1602)|
| 0:26:47| which has had a lot of support from Councilwoman Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=1607)|
| 0:26:50| We'll be there to unveil the beautiful signage that Robin Easter Design has done for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=1610)|
| 0:26:55| And then we have Preservation and Libations at the Crown and Goose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=1615)|
| 0:27:00| We're there the last Wednesday of every month at 530.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=1620)|
| 0:27:03| It's free just to drop in for everyone to come by.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=1623)|
| 0:27:06| So I want to thank all of you for all of your support of preservation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=1626)|
| 0:27:09| I know sometimes it's challenging and requires more thought than just knocking something over,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=1629)|
| 0:27:14| but we've definitely found that in the long run it's a much better investment for the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=1634)|
| 0:27:18| And I want to thank the mayor for including the Historic Preservation Fund in her budget this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=1638)|
| 0:27:23| And I want to encourage all of you to support that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=1643)|
| 0:27:26| since it does save historic buildings all over our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=1646)|
| 0:27:29| So thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=1649)|
| 0:27:30| Thank you, Kim.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=1650)|
| 0:27:36| So that's the end of my report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=1656)|
| 0:27:38| Vice Mayor Grieve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=1658)|
| 0:27:40| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=1660)|
| 0:27:42| First, I want to start by saying that we had a very successful retreat with Council this past Saturday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=1662)|
| 0:27:47| And, Mayor, you've already announced that on May 17th the Council budget retreat will be held in this room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=1667)|
| 0:27:53| That will be this coming Tuesday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=1673)|
| 0:27:55| Also, I want to let folks know that a resolution will be coming before Council to change the time of Council meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=1675)|
| 0:28:05| This resolution will come before us to move Council meetings from 7 to 6,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=1685)|
| 0:28:10| and the beer board meetings will be moved from 6 to 5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=1690)|
| 0:28:14| That resolution is in the works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=1694)|
| 0:28:16| I'll probably announce that each time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=1696)|
| 0:28:18| The earliest possible date that that might occur would be July 19th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=1698)|
| 0:28:22| That's what we're looking at as a possibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=1702)|
| 0:28:25| On that, the other thing, and this was already announced by Kay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=1705)|
| 0:28:29| but I just want to emphasize once again that in the 2nd District we do have a home,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=1709)|
| 0:28:34| the home of Dorothy and Cesar Stair, called Hilltop,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=1714)|
| 0:28:37| that has been acknowledged by the National and the Tennessee Register of Historic Properties on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=1717)|
| 0:28:44| So I want to just emphasize that again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=1724)|
| 0:28:46| It's appropriate at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=1726)|
| 0:28:48| We just received the official letter in the mail today that it was officially designated as a National Register property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=1728)|
| 0:28:54| Right. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=1734)|
| 0:28:56| Mayor, another concern that I have, and if I can take a few minutes of time here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=1736)|
| 0:29:01| is that, as all of us know, we've been at the last several Council meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=1741)|
| 0:29:05| we've heard a lot about the homeless situation, the homeless situation here in Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=1745)|
| 0:29:10| the homeless camps and this sort of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=1750)|
| 0:29:13| I took it upon myself to go visit one of the homeless camps,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=1753)|
| 0:29:17| and unfortunately I think that we as a city need to be concerned about the health and welfare| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=1757)|
| 0:29:23| of not only these homeless folks and the camps that they're living in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=1763)|
| 0:29:26| but also I think to all our citizens through, because what I saw at these places,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=1766)|
| 0:29:31| and I think that some photographs have been passed out to you in terms of what we're looking at,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=1771)|
| 0:29:37| is that what I saw in the creek and what I saw in the camps itself is just totally irresponsible,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=1777)|
| 0:29:46| not only of the people that are doing this, but also for us to allow this to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=1786)|
| 0:29:50| I know also that at the core of our homelessness or our homeless work that we're looking at in the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=1790)|
| 0:29:59| is that we want to do away with homelessness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=1799)|
| 0:30:03| We want people to have a place to live.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=1803)|
| 0:30:06| And I think that what I'd like to do, if it's okay, Mayor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=1806)|
| 0:30:10| is to have Chief Roush talk a little bit about it and David Brace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=1810)|
| 0:30:15| As of today, in that particular area, they've hauled off 169 tons of trash.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=1815)|
| 0:30:22| 169 tons of trash.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=1822)|
| 0:30:26| And you can see by the photographs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=1826)|
| 0:30:28| Also, I think that it was interesting I found out that in talking with the police| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=1828)|
| 0:30:32| and walking through the camps that we've been told here at council that all of a sudden people show up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=1832)|
| 0:30:38| the police show up and they get rid of the people and the bulldozers come in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=1838)|
| 0:30:42| and there's no warning or this sort of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=1842)|
| 0:30:44| And I think the Chief can also show us a document that's handed to these folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=1844)|
| 0:30:49| They're given 72 hours minimum in order to leave the camp and take their stuff with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=1849)|
| 0:30:55| And from what I understand in the police that I talked to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=1855)|
| 0:30:58| that actually they're given as much as a week to clean up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=1858)|
| 0:31:02| They're also given a small brochure that tells them what kind of services are available to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=1862)|
| 0:31:08| So I think that when we talk about homelessness,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=1868)|
| 0:31:13| I think that we need to let the citizens in our city know that we as a city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=1873)|
| 0:31:18| we as the administration, the council, the police, as well as the service department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=1878)|
| 0:31:22| are doing an awful lot to try to help and to try to look at what can happen in this particular situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=1882)|
| 0:31:29| This also brings to mind that all of us have been pushed a little bit about this Homeless Bill of Rights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=1889)|
| 0:31:35| If you really read the Homeless Bill of Rights, what it does,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=1895)|
| 0:31:38| it really protects those that want to be homeless to stay homeless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=1898)|
| 0:31:42| It doesn't talk about going into housing and this sort of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=1902)|
| 0:31:45| And I think that that's something that all of us need to look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=1905)|
| 0:31:48| So with your permission, Mayor, I'd like for Chief Rausch to let us know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=1908)|
| 0:31:53| and the citizens know exactly what it is that the police department do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=1913)|
| 0:31:57| in terms of these camps and what's happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=1917)|
| 0:31:59| And then if David Brace could take a few minutes to tell what the service department has been doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=1919)|
| 0:32:04| By the way, I went by there again today, and not only has the city cleaned up the one area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=1924)|
| 0:32:09| the railroad company is on the other side moving stuff out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=1929)|
| 0:32:13| And it's actually unbelievable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=1933)|
| 0:32:15| Of course, you can see from the photographs in terms of what the situation is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=1935)|
| 0:32:19| And we really just should not allow people to live in this manner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=1939)|
| 0:32:23| It's just unconscionable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=1943)|
| 0:32:25| But if the Chief can go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=1945)|
| 0:32:26| Chief Rausch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=1946)|
| 0:32:28| Thank you, Mayor, and thank you, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=1948)|
| 0:32:31| So I just want to clarify that, as the Vice Mayor mentioned, we do have a process in place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=1951)|
| 0:32:37| and that process is humane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=1957)|
| 0:32:40| That process does allow plenty of notice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=1960)|
| 0:32:46| We do have a form that we take around to these locations when we need to go through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=1966)|
| 0:32:55| and clear the area out because of what you see, the health and safety issues that exist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=1975)|
| 0:33:02| When our officers go on site, they meet with anyone that is there, and they provide them the information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=1982)|
| 0:33:10| Now, the information says 72 hours is what we provide them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=1990)|
| 0:33:15| You were somewhat correct there, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=1995)|
| 0:33:18| Actually, in this cleanup, our officers gave over three weeks' notice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=1998)|
| 0:33:24| They spent time, Officer Tom Clinton actually spent his time out there meeting with every one of the individuals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=2004)|
| 0:33:35| that were in these camps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=2015)|
| 0:33:39| He face-to-face met with them, explained to them what was getting ready to happen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=2019)|
| 0:33:44| why it was happening, and offered services, explained to them what services were available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=2024)|
| 0:33:51| And that was his initial contact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=2031)|
| 0:33:54| He spoke with them, over 50 different camps in this area, 50 different persons,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=2034)|
| 0:34:06| well, more than 50 people, but 50 actual encampments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=2046)|
| 0:34:11| and had conversations with them and explained to them what we were needing to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=2051)|
| 0:34:15| and why we were needing to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=2055)|
| 0:34:17| This all has to do with, as you see in the pictures, the health and safety issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=2057)|
| 0:34:24| These are deplorable conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=2064)|
| 0:34:27| No one should live in these types of conditions, and no human being should face this type of condition at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=2067)|
| 0:34:39| In addition to that, that's the health conditions and the safety conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=2079)|
| 0:34:43| There's trespassing taking place on private land, on public land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=2083)|
| 0:34:50| And as you saw, there was a sign there in the initial photograph, hazardous waste,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=2090)|
| 0:34:57| areas that have not been remediated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=2097)|
| 0:35:00| And they're digging in those areas and spreading hazardous material.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=2100)|
| 0:35:06| So there are a number of health and safety issues that exist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=2106)|
| 0:35:09| But our officers are very cordial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=2109)|
| 0:35:12| When we come through, no one was arrested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=2112)|
| 0:35:15| When we did start this particular strategy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=2115)|
| 0:35:22| we were worried that there may be some that wouldn't leave,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=2122)|
| 0:35:26| and they had plenty of notice over three weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=2126)|
| 0:35:30| And when we did finally come through, on the date we told them that we would be there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=2130)|
| 0:35:35| at the time we said we would be there, there were only two individuals that did not leave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=2135)|
| 0:35:41| And when we arrived, they packed their things and they left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=2141)|
| 0:35:45| And so this is what was left behind, what you see,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=2145)|
| 0:35:49| and certainly is not a healthy or safe area to reside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=2149)|
| 0:35:57| So David Brace, Public Works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=2157)|
| 0:36:00| I think we had spoken, obviously, the Public Works crews,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=2160)|
| 0:36:04| that's a combination of the Service Department and Stormwater.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=2164)|
| 0:36:08| Obviously, we've been aware of these locations for a number of years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=2168)|
| 0:36:12| and do occasional cleanups on a regular schedule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=2172)|
| 0:36:15| We were actually contacted by the city's Stormwater Department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=2175)|
| 0:36:18| because of the health concerns for the individuals on the PSC metals site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=2178)|
| 0:36:22| PSC metals was a scrap recycling site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=2182)|
| 0:36:25| It is heavily contaminated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=2185)|
| 0:36:27| I know the document that you have talks about the heavy metals that are on that site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=2187)|
| 0:36:31| And so the real concern was that we had citizens, customers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=2191)|
| 0:36:36| that are living on an exceedingly contaminated piece of property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=2196)|
| 0:36:39| digging, obviously, for metal scraps that can then be scrapped for some revenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=2199)|
| 0:36:45| And disturbing that soil allows additional runoff into Second Creek,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=2205)|
| 0:36:49| but it's also the more important component of that is that the individuals digging| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=2209)|
| 0:36:53| are exposed to significant heavy metals and other toxins on a daily basis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=2213)|
| 0:36:59| not only in the digging but in the living.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=2219)|
| 0:37:02| Couple that with syringes and the fecal matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=2222)|
| 0:37:05| Stormwater, which is mandated per the state, per our NPDES permit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=2225)|
| 0:37:10| to address those issues, really contacted the chief and I about a cleanup.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=2230)|
| 0:37:15| We don't take this lightly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=2235)|
| 0:37:17| There's really three priorities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=2237)|
| 0:37:19| Obviously, the health and safety of the citizens,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=2239)|
| 0:37:21| the customers that live in these dangerous environments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=2241)|
| 0:37:23| the citizens and the general public around those areas and downstream.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=2243)|
| 0:37:28| And then, obviously, the environment is another piece of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=2248)|
| 0:37:31| I think council hopefully knows this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=2251)|
| 0:37:34| I know Mike Dunthorne is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=2254)|
| 0:37:36| He's full-time, works on homeless issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=2256)|
| 0:37:39| Becky Way with community development, redevelopment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=2259)|
| 0:37:42| There's a team of folks that really have a desire to try to meet the needs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=2262)|
| 0:37:46| of those who are in these really dangerous campsites.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=2266)|
| 0:37:49| That's the actual digging site on PSC Metals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=2269)|
| 0:37:53| Again, those are pits, and that is heavily contaminated soil.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=2273)|
| 0:37:58| And so that's really what initiated this cleanup,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=2278)|
| 0:38:00| and I think we just believe that at this point it was not in any way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=2280)|
| 0:38:05| appropriate for us to let people live that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=2285)|
| 0:38:07| But we are available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=2287)|
| 0:38:09| We are looking for solutions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=2289)|
| 0:38:11| We don't take it lightly, and I know that we've got a good relationship,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=2291)|
| 0:38:14| and we do work with Mr. Young and his folks and try to look for solutions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=2294)|
| 0:38:19| But the unsafe and unhealthy conditions are a real concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=2299)|
| 0:38:24| Thank you, David.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=2304)|
| 0:38:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=2305)|
| 0:38:26| And, Chief, also I'll pass around what the chief was talking about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=2306)|
| 0:38:29| in terms of his notice of trespassing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=2309)|
| 0:38:31| and then also the small brochure that they give for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=2311)|
| 0:38:35| But to really actually go there, I mean, the pictures don't really give it justice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=2315)|
| 0:38:39| in terms of what really was there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=2319)|
| 0:38:40| And, of course, a lot of it's been cleaned up by now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=2320)|
| 0:38:42| But I think it's important to let the people know also what the administration has done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=2322)|
| 0:38:48| what the city is doing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=2328)|
| 0:38:49| and the fact that you are actively working to find a solution to what the problem is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=2329)|
| 0:38:54| So, Mayor, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=2334)|
| 0:38:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=2336)|
| 0:38:57| I'll pass this around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=2337)|
| 0:38:58| Thank you, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=2338)|
| 0:38:59| Any other reports from council?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=2339)|

| 0:44:54| increasing the estimated project cost by $1,985,000 of additional funding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=2694)|

| 0:45:07| Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=2707)|
| 0:45:08| Yeah, thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=2708)|
| 0:45:09| I'd like to call on Mr. Hagerman to explain this a little bit, $9 million,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=2709)|
| 0:45:15| and what's the bang for the buck here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=2715)|
| 0:45:20| Jim Hagerman, Director of Engineering for the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=2720)|
| 0:45:24| This and the next item are connected to each other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=2724)|
| 0:45:29| We got a CMAQ grant a few months ago for $2 million that we are adding to a pot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=2729)|
| 0:45:38| that already existed of $7 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=2738)|
| 0:45:41| So this is just to roll those into the same contract| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=2741)|
| 0:45:46| and increase the scope of the consultant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=2746)|
| 0:45:50| to take into account the larger resources that we have to work with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=2750)|
| 0:45:56| How much of that is local money?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=2756)|
| 0:45:59| This $2 million that's added is 100% federal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=2759)|
| 0:46:05| So there's not even a match.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=2765)|
| 0:46:08| Good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=2768)|
| 0:46:09| All right, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=2769)|
| 0:46:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=2770)|
| 0:46:11| Councilman Dallavapi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=2771)|
| 0:46:12| To partially answer Mr. Wallace's question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=2772)|
| 0:46:15| I guess in the past there was $1.4 million in local money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=2775)|
| 0:46:18| that was in there for the first part of the project, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=2778)|
| 0:46:21| Sounds right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=2781)|
| 0:46:22| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=2782)|
| 0:46:23| And the other thing I want to mention is that this is really a good opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=2783)|
| 0:46:27| to see if we can keep traffic moving instead of stopping and polluting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=2787)|
| 0:46:32| and watch those big buses that look like battleships put the brakes on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=2792)|
| 0:46:36| for lights that aren't timed well and stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=2796)|
| 0:46:39| So I'm hoping that at the end of the day you guys get a lot more control| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=2799)|
| 0:46:42| on how traffic flows and how we conserve resources| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=2802)|
| 0:46:47| in the process of getting from here to there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=2807)|
| 0:46:49| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=2809)|
| 0:46:51| And just to be clear, this is still in the design phase,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=2811)|
| 0:46:54| so we're not to actual construction yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=2814)|
| 0:46:58| Yeah, we are still pretty early in the whole process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=2818)|
| 0:47:01| The whole system gets designed so that it all works together,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=2821)|
| 0:47:07| and then the individual components, the individual intersections are designed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=2827)|
| 0:47:12| and then is construction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=2832)|
| 0:47:14| and there's a couple of approval processes with TDOT in the middle of all of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=2834)|
| 0:47:19| The march of 1,000 miles begins with the first step, so I appreciate you taking it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=2839)|
| 0:47:23| Yeah, well, we've taken a couple of steps, but this is where we're going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=2843)|
| 0:47:27| Okay, good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=2847)|

| 0:55:21| I know there was an issue that arose during the course of this coming up, and I believe that this particular item was postponed for one or two meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=3321)|
| 0:55:31| It's my understanding that the northwest county sector plan and the one-year plan for it are under review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=3331)|
| 0:55:37| and there's going to be some further discussions between now and the second reading of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=3337)|

| 0:57:52| Yes, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=3472)|
| 0:57:53| I see Attorney here to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=3473)|
| 0:57:55| We have three people signing to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=3475)|
| 0:57:57| Let me just briefly say that this is a piece of property on the south side of Asheville Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=3477)|
| 0:58:03| It used to be an old school that was taken over by the veterans, I guess it is, or the American Legion, and they are now selling that property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=3483)|
| 0:58:15| There's a schoolhouse with its own auditorium and about two acres of land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=3495)|
| 0:58:20| It has a lot of storage internal to it as well as an auditorium area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=3500)|
| 0:58:26| There seems to have been some mix-up in the early phases of the MPC review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=3506)|
| 0:58:33| No one appeared for the applicant to speak, but I believe they were asking for C3 zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=3513)|
| 0:58:40| They got O1 because it's a transition to residential use that's nearby.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=3520)|
| 0:58:47| I understand they're here to seek C4 because that would allow auctions in that auditorium area that is part of the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=3527)|
| 0:59:00| That was not before MPC, so we can act on it, as I understand the law, as a council, but it will end up back at MPC if we do approve that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=3540)|
| 0:59:10| But I'd like to hear from the applicant's attorney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=3550)|
| 0:59:13| Okay, I have three people signed up, Arthur Seymour, John Coker, and Marty Everett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=3553)|
| 0:59:19| Mr. Seymour, as you know, I'll get your name and address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=3559)|
| 0:59:23| Mayor, members of council, Arthur Seymour, Jr., 550 West Main Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=3563)|
| 0:59:29| I am here on behalf of John Coker, who is the potential purchaser for this site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=3569)|
| 0:59:36| Raise your hand, John.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=3576)|
| 0:59:39| John's a well-known auctioneer, estate evaluator, appraiser, and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=3579)|
| 0:59:47| His primary place of business is in Newmarket, Tennessee, but he does an awful lot of business here in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=3587)|
| 0:59:54| This building is ideal for an auction house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=3594)|
| 0:59:58| As Councilman Della Volpe mentioned, it has an auditorium in there, and he can conduct his auctions four or five times a year in there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=3598)|
| 1:00:06| and also securely store goods that are given to him for auction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=3606)|
| 1:00:13| The problem was the American Legion, I think on the advice of a realtor, applied for C-3 zoning for the site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=3613)|
| 1:00:21| which would appear on its face perhaps to allow auctions there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=3621)|
| 1:00:27| However, in discussing this with city zoning officials,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=3627)|
| 1:00:35| it turns out that C-4 is the only zone that would allow an auction house| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=3635)|
| 1:00:41| because it is specifically enumerated as a permitted use in that district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=3641)|
| 1:00:49| C-4, I know, is not a favored zone because it allows used car lots, car lots, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=3649)|
| 1:00:57| Mr. Coker has absolutely zero intention of operating a car lot there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=3657)|
| 1:01:01| He has never been in the car business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=3661)|
| 1:01:04| I guess as an auctioneer on estates, he occasionally sells a car,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=3664)|
| 1:01:08| but he would do that at the site of the car rather than bringing it to the auction house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=3668)|
| 1:01:14| So after consultation with Law Director Swanson and City Council's attorney, Mr. Frost,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=3674)|
| 1:01:23| and understanding the law for the American Legion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=3683)|
| 1:01:28| which is moving elsewhere to sell this property to Mr. Coker,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=3688)|
| 1:01:34| this matter would have to be referred back by you all to MPC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=3694)|
| 1:01:42| to allow consideration of a C-4 zone with this site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=3702)|
| 1:01:48| and that's what we're asking you all to do here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=3708)|
| 1:01:52| This is the site of the old Sunnyview Elementary School,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=3712)|
| 1:01:56| which was abandoned, ultimately purchased by the American Legion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=3716)|
| 1:02:01| We are going to remove the tank in front of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=3721)|
| 1:02:04| It will not remain once they sell the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=3724)|
| 1:02:09| That will make the auctions more orderly, though, won't it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=3729)|
| 1:02:12| Well, I think the neighborhood children enjoy the tank.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=3732)|
| 1:02:15| At any rate, that's the proposal, and that's what we would sincerely ask you to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=3735)|
| 1:02:22| Mr. Everett is here with the Legion Post and would like to say a word to you, if he may.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=3742)|
| 1:02:28| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=3748)|
| 1:02:31| Thank you. Thank you for being here. State your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=3751)|
| 1:02:34| Marty Everett, 7222 West Shermont, and I'm a member of the American Legion Post, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=3754)|
| 1:02:40| I'm a member of the Executive Committee, but we have 702 members,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=3760)|
| 1:02:44| and our intent is to sell the property and move to a more central location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=3764)|
| 1:02:49| And we currently have a contract with Mr. Coker pending approval of the zoning request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=3769)|
| 1:03:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=3784)|
| 1:03:05| That's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=3785)|
| 1:03:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=3786)|
| 1:03:07| And so, Mr. Coker, did you want to speak, too, or not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=3787)|
| 1:03:12| All right. Well, that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=3792)|
| 1:03:14| You're under no obligation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=3794)|
| 1:03:17| Who just called on me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=3797)|
| 1:03:18| I did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=3798)|
| 1:03:19| Oh, Gerald.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=3799)|
| 1:03:20| Gerald Green, MPC Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=3800)|
| 1:03:21| I would like to provide some background for the MPC staff's recommendation and the MPC recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=3801)|
| 1:03:30| The concept of an auction house there is a good one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=3810)|
| 1:03:34| Unfortunately, our zoning does not allow us to restrict a use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=3814)|
| 1:03:38| So when you zone it for C4, you're zoning it for any use that could go on that property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=3818)|
| 1:03:43| for as long as that C4 remains, which could be a lot longer than any of us are seated at the tables and podiums in this room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=3823)|
| 1:03:52| And that's a challenge we as staff have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=3832)|
| 1:03:54| We have to understand that even though we appreciate the American Legion and their desire,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=3834)|
| 1:03:59| that the zoning, once we apply that zoning, any use can occur.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=3839)|
| 1:04:04| This property has no access from Asheville Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=3844)|
| 1:04:08| It would introduce commercial zoning onto Ruggles Ferry Road back into a more residential neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=3848)|
| 1:04:14| There are a number of vacant and underdeveloped commercial properties on Asheville Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=3854)|
| 1:04:20| That led us to our recommendation for the Office 01 zoning, feeling that would make a nice transition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=3860)|
| 1:04:28| We would be happy to work with the American Legion, with Mr. Coker, to try to limit the uses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=3868)|
| 1:04:33| but I don't think that, and I'll look to Law Director Swanson, I don't think our zoning legislation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=3873)|
| 1:04:39| enabling legislation in North Carolina, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=3879)|
| 1:04:43| I almost made the transition after 10 months in Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=3883)|
| 1:04:47| In North Carolina, it does allow us, and it's a great tool,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=3887)|
| 1:04:50| and I would hope that Tennessee would allow us to do that at some point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=3890)|
| 1:04:54| Any help that the council members can give, and we'll push for that from our staff position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=3894)|
| 1:05:00| But keep that in mind, and that's a challenge we have in doing this, that we can't limit those uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=3900)|
| 1:05:06| And it's a real challenge for us in trying to assure that property owners can make adequate use of their property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=3906)|
| 1:05:13| but also protect the surrounding uses and balance that public, or the community will,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=3913)|
| 1:05:19| what the will and the needs of the private property owners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=3919)|
| 1:05:22| And just wanted to provide that background as to why our recommendation was what it was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=3922)|
| 1:05:27| and then the MPC Commission recommendation is what it was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=3927)|
| 1:05:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=3931)|
| 1:05:32| Thank you, Mr. Ray.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=3932)|
| 1:05:33| Councilman Della Voca.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=3933)|
| 1:05:34| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=3934)|
| 1:05:35| Briefly, I want to mention that we confronted this kind of legal conundrum in the past| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=3935)|
| 1:05:41| with regard to can you condition away a use allowed by law, permitted use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=3941)|
| 1:05:51| And one of the ways it was solved up in Fountain City during your tenure as head of MPC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=3951)|
| 1:05:58| was the parties engaged in a written covenant or restriction on the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=3958)|
| 1:06:04| so that you didn't have to hope that not only Mr. Coker but any successor in interest would observe the limitations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=3964)|
| 1:06:13| but that they were agreed as part of the deed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=3973)|
| 1:06:16| And I don't know if Mr. Swanson has a comment on that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=3976)|
| 1:06:19| but it's certainly a way that the law allows the parties to sell that property and have a restriction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=3979)|
| 1:06:25| The only other point I want to mention is that particular building has both good storage area and an auditorium,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=3985)|
| 1:06:33| and I doubt you're going to find that elsewhere on Asheville Highway in terms of availability within the structure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=3993)|
| 1:06:40| Now, there's a lot of acreage, I admit, on Asheville Highway that is commercial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=4000)|
| 1:06:44| and probably has suited for that, but if this is really primarily a storage facility with occasional auctions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=4004)|
| 1:06:51| there ought to be a way for the parties to agree sort of by contract that goes along with the deed to limit it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=4011)|
| 1:06:57| and I just throw that out as a thought so we don't have to worry are we doing something untoward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=4017)|
| 1:07:02| under our state's zoning laws and restrictions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=4022)|
| 1:07:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=4027)|
| 1:07:08| Councilman Wallace?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=4028)|
| 1:07:09| Well, I'd just echo those remarks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=4029)|
| 1:07:11| and I think it's prudent to send it back to MPC to try to find those exceptions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=4031)|
| 1:07:16| and what deed restrictions can be made, just like we did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=4036)|
| 1:07:20| This is what we ran into on these old schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=4040)|
| 1:07:22| We ran into this last year on a rezoning of a church and schools where they went in on a no-zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=4042)|
| 1:07:27| and they were left a commercial building in a residential area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=4047)|
| 1:07:31| So, anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=4051)|
| 1:07:33| That office that they wanted to do on Cedar Lane, I think it was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=4053)|
| 1:07:36| I think it's only prudent to send it back and see what they can come up with so we can vote on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=4056)|
| 1:07:40| And Mayor and Councilmembers, we would be happy at MPC to work with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=4060)|
| 1:07:44| When the request first came before us, there was not a specific use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=4064)|
| 1:07:49| It was just a general C-3 zoning, so we did not have the parameters we have now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=4069)|
| 1:07:54| Again, we'd be happy to work with the applicants to see what we could come up with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=4074)|
| 1:07:59| that would be acceptable to the law director and meet the standards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=4079)|
| 1:08:02| and some of those agreements would have to be private agreements between the property owner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=4082)|
| 1:08:07| and the prospective purchaser that we would not be party to enforcing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=4087)|
| 1:08:14| Well, I'll make a motion we push it back to MPC for further study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=4094)|
| 1:08:18| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=4098)|
| 1:08:20| Okay, we have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=4100)|
| 1:08:22| Any more discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=4102)|
| 1:08:24| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=4104)|
| 1:08:25| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=4105)|
| 1:08:26| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=4106)|
| 1:08:27| The ayes have it and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=4107)|
| 1:08:29| This will go back to MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=4109)|
| 1:08:33| 12N is an ordinance to rezone property located on the northwest side of Chambliss Avenue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=4113)|
| 1:08:38| west of Lebanon Street, from R2 District to O1 District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=4118)|
| 1:08:42| Can Welgett Sawney, applicant, 2nd District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=4122)|
| 1:08:46| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=4126)|
| 1:08:47| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=4127)|
| 1:08:49| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=4129)|
| 1:08:50| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=4130)|
| 1:08:51| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=4131)|
| 1:08:52| The ayes have it and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=4132)|
| 1:08:54| 12O is an ordinance to rezone property located on the northwest side of Chambliss Avenue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=4134)|
| 1:08:57| west side of East Moody Avenue, from OS2 District to OS2 District, H1 District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=4137)|
| 1:09:08| With design guidelines, Mayor Madeleine Rijero, applicant, 1st District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=4148)|
| 1:09:12| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=4152)|
| 1:09:13| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=4153)|
| 1:09:15| Councilman Pablos.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=4155)|
| 1:09:17| Yeah, I'd like to also hear this on emergency with the council's approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=4157)|
| 1:09:24| This situation here, it's a piece of property that is adjacent to the old South Knox Time building that we acquired some time ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=4164)|
| 1:09:34| We want to take this property and make it a whole one plot that we can hopefully use for parking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=4174)|
| 1:09:42| and obviously would make it a heck of a lot more marketable for us to get back on the tax rolls from the city's perspective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=4182)|
| 1:09:51| The reason being, it can be heard this coming up May 12th meeting at the MTC if we approve it tonight on an emergency basis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=4191)|
| 1:09:59| and obviously the sooner we get this done, the quicker it can get back on the market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=4199)|
| 1:10:05| So I would like to make that motion on emergency if possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=4205)|
| 1:10:08| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=4208)|
| 1:10:09| First we'll vote on that amendment to pass it on emergency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=4209)|
| 1:10:13| We have a motion and a second for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=4213)|
| 1:10:15| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=4215)|
| 1:10:16| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=4216)|
| 1:10:17| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=4217)|
| 1:10:18| That passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=4218)|
| 1:10:19| So now back to the original motion as amended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=4219)|
| 1:10:22| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=4222)|
| 1:10:24| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=4224)|
| 1:10:25| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=4225)|
| 1:10:26| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=4226)|
| 1:10:27| The ayes have it and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=4227)|
| 1:10:30| 12P is an ordinance approving the sum of $1,400 from Parks and Recreation Department funds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=4230)|
| 1:10:35| and donating the same to the Boys and Girls Club of the Tennessee Valley to be utilized| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=4235)|
| 1:10:39| toward the Greater Knoxville Sports Hall of Fame dinner and induction ceremony.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=4239)|
| 1:10:44| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=4244)|
| 1:10:45| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=4245)|
| 1:10:46| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=4246)|
| 1:10:47| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=4247)|
| 1:10:48| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=4248)|
| 1:10:49| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=4249)|
| 1:10:50| The ayes have it and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=4250)|
| 1:10:57| Okay, so now we have one more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=4257)|
| 1:11:06| Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=4266)|
| 1:11:07| No, that's two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=4267)|
| 1:11:10| Oh, it's got an asterisk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=4270)|
| 1:11:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=4271)|
| 1:11:12| I'd written over my asterisk so I didn't see it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=4272)|
| 1:11:14| Okay, so that brings us to the end of the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=4274)|
| 1:11:16| We now have public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=4276)|
| 1:11:18| And Council, we have eight people signed up for public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=4278)|
| 1:11:23| So I'm going to call on our Vice Mayor to give us some direction here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=4283)|
| 1:11:29| If it pleases Council, we'll suspend the rules and let each individual have five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=4289)|
| 1:11:34| Any objection, Council?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=4294)|
| 1:11:35| Yeah, I mean, I think that we, you know, we see a lot of different groups that we know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=4295)|
| 1:11:39| that come here weekly at our meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=4299)|
| 1:11:43| And, you know, I think it would be, unless there's, you know, a change in the message,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=4303)|
| 1:11:48| that we limit the, you know, the amount of folks that speak to one subject.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=4308)|
| 1:11:53| I mean, we're hearing the same thing over and again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=4313)|
| 1:11:56| So, I mean, it's up to the Council, but I think that that would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=4316)|
| 1:12:00| Are you saying limit the time or have them get together and decide what the message is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=4320)|
| 1:12:05| I would say that, you know, folks can get together and decide who's going to be the spokesperson per issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=4325)|
| 1:12:10| and, you know, move with and go on with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=4330)|
| 1:12:13| But, you know, it's a, the ordinance that is in place is that, you know, we stay for 30 minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=4333)|
| 1:12:21| But we've removed that at recent meetings, and we tend to hear the same rhetoric time and again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=4341)|
| 1:12:29| So my suggestion is that we limit the amount of folks that speak to one topic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=4349)|
| 1:12:38| I think the only problem I have with that is that if someone takes the time and energy to come up to City Council to speak,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=4358)|
| 1:12:43| that we ought to, if anything, we could say three minutes each.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=4363)|
| 1:12:46| That would kill us under the 30 minutes or four minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=4366)|
| 1:12:49| That's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=4369)|
| 1:12:50| I think we could limit it to that if Council approves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=4370)|
| 1:12:53| I'll second on the four minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=4373)|
| 1:12:55| Four minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=4375)|
| 1:12:56| So we have a motion and a second to allow four minutes each.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=4376)|
| 1:12:59| Is there any discussion on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=4379)|
| 1:13:01| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=4381)|
| 1:13:02| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=4382)|
| 1:13:03| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=4383)|
| 1:13:04| And I do think this is an issue that Council needs to address, Nick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=4384)|
| 1:13:08| I agree with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=4388)|
| 1:13:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=4389)|
| 1:13:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=4390)|
| 1:13:11| Thank you, Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=4391)|
| 1:13:12| So I'll set the timer for up to four minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=4392)|
| 1:13:14| So first we have Sandy Robinson followed by Stuart O'Gwen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=4394)|
| 1:13:21| Did I say that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=4401)|
| 1:13:22| Charles Susano and Katie Bybee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=4402)|
| 1:13:28| Not here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=4408)|
| 1:13:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=4409)|
| 1:13:31| And Steve, you are all here to talk about sidewalks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=4411)|
| 1:13:37| Thank you for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=4417)|
| 1:13:38| And if you would just please state your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=4418)|
| 1:13:40| And per Council rules, I'll set the timer and I'll give you a reminder before you get to the end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=4420)|
| 1:13:45| Thank you for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=4425)|
| 1:13:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=4426)|
| 1:13:47| Thank you, Mayor, Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=4427)|
| 1:13:50| I've cut this down to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=4430)|
| 1:13:51| I don't know whether I can cut it down to four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=4431)|
| 1:13:54| Thank you for listening to me and letting a few of us speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=4434)|
| 1:13:58| I want you to know that I'm fully aware that each of your districts has needs and requests similar to ours regarding sidewalks, and I am empathetic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=4438)|
| 1:14:08| All of you have different issues and reasons for sidewalks, and each is as important to your constituents as ours is to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=4448)|
| 1:14:17| We must bring more awareness of the importance of sidewalks to the neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=4457)|
| 1:14:22| Sidewalk neighborhoods are the core of our neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=4462)|
| 1:14:29| I'm here tonight to tell you why our request for a sidewalk on Sheffield Drive from Wesley Road to the school is super important to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=4469)|
| 1:14:40| We moved to West Hills in the county in 1956.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=4480)|
| 1:14:46| It was a pasture with a barn on the corner of Wesley and Kingston Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=4486)|
| 1:14:51| West Hills was the first new subdivision to be developed west.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=4491)|
| 1:14:57| In two short years, 1958, Sheffield Drive was extended and West Hills School was built, grades one through eight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=4497)|
| 1:15:05| And so Sheffield Drive became the main through street east to west nestled between Kingston Pike and Middlebrook Pike, which was two lanes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=4505)|
| 1:15:16| Development just exploded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=4516)|
| 1:15:18| Predicting the growth, the city wanted us annexed, although not documented, because according to Chief Engineer Hagerman, they did not document it then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=4518)|
| 1:15:27| And since we were the east-west artery through this area, we were promised a sidewalk if we were annexed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=4527)|
| 1:15:33| And we were naive enough to believe this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=4533)|
| 1:15:36| This was 1962.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=4536)|
| 1:15:39| Fast forward to now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=4539)|
| 1:15:41| This original area has approximately 600 homes, 250 apartments, and 24 townhomes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=4541)|
| 1:15:48| This is in the immediate area that we're talking about, not all of West Hills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=4548)|
| 1:15:53| We are bounded on the south by Kingston Pike and to the north by now four-lane, heavily-traveled Middlebrook Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=4553)|
| 1:16:01| We have endured unbelievable growth, development of all kinds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=4561)|
| 1:16:06| We have traffic from Kingston Pike, West Town, and I won't go on with all the others since we're short of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=4566)|
| 1:16:12| But in just the last three or four years, additionally, there are three new hotels, Whole Foods Shopping Center, Trader Joe's and Suburban Center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=4572)|
| 1:16:22| Proposed-to-Nova Hospital, Weigel's, 16 Pumps, and Superstore, and a new proposed assisted living facility is in process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=4582)|
| 1:16:33| So Sheffield Drive is the main through street, east to west, and cut through street, using this street to avoid traffic on Kingston Pike and Middlebrook Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=4593)|
| 1:16:43| Traffic is becoming busier and busier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=4603)|
| 1:16:45| West Hills is cycling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=4605)|
| 1:16:48| Young families with children to empty nesters are now back to young families and children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=4608)|
| 1:16:54| Due to the lack of safety, the children at West Hills Elementary School in this area cannot walk but need to be driven to school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=4614)|
| 1:17:01| Have you ever seen the congestion at 730 in the morning or 245 in the afternoon at the school?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=4621)|
| 1:17:08| You would have if you walked with us on our walk from Wesley Road and Kingston Pike to the school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=4628)|
| 1:17:13| It has emphasized the awareness of our need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=4633)|
| 1:17:16| The children cannot safely walk to and from the school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=4636)|
| 1:17:19| The children and families can't access the park safely by foot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=4639)|
| 1:17:24| We all know the obesity problem, Tennessee being one of the worst, but we must drive a car to be safe to get to those places.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=4644)|
| 1:17:32| To quote the mayor from her State of the City address,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=4652)|
| 1:17:35| Great neighborhoods are the building blocks of a great city, and great neighborhoods are, first and foremost, safe neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=4655)|
| 1:17:43| We've always been a great neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=4663)|
| 1:17:45| We have a yearly cleanup day where neighbors walk the neighborhood, school, and Bearden Library picking up trash.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=4665)|
| 1:17:52| We planted and maintained gardens at our entrance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=4672)|
| 1:17:55| We have a pool party and a holiday dinner every year where neighbors get together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=4675)|
| 1:18:00| Again, to quote Mayor Rojero,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=4680)|
| 1:18:03| Strong and safe neighborhoods are connected with access to parks, greenways, and recreational facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=4683)|
| 1:18:11| We want a safe street, a sidewalk to connect us to our school, parks, greenways, and recreational facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=4691)|
| 1:18:19| Ma'am, I need to ask you to wrap it up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=4699)|
| 1:18:22| Last paragraph.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=4702)|
| 1:18:24| Wrap it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=4704)|
| 1:18:26| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=4706)|
| 1:18:27| Remember, we were this quiet little neighborhood in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=4707)|
| 1:18:31| We've never complained about the growth inflicted on us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=4711)|
| 1:18:34| Is it fair that the city has imposed so much taxable growth surrounding our peaceful community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=4714)|
| 1:18:41| without commensurately keeping up with our safety and the well-being of the residents?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=4721)|
| 1:18:46| All these surrounding entities that I spoke of produce traffic and taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=4726)|
| 1:18:51| Can you give back a minuscule amount to contribute to our safety with the sidewalk?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=4731)|
| 1:18:57| Thank you, Mrs. Robinson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=4737)|
| 1:18:59| If you would please give us your address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=4739)|
| 1:19:02| Sure, 7106 Sheffield Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=4742)|
| 1:19:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=4744)|
| 1:19:05| And I just want to say you listen and be there for us, and I promise you we will listen and be there for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=4745)|
| 1:19:11| And thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=4751)|
| 1:19:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=4753)|
| 1:19:15| Stuart O'Gwen here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=4755)|
| 1:19:18| Mr. Cezanne, I'm going to give you two minutes based on that, okay, when it's your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=4758)|
| 1:19:23| Okay, sir, please state your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=4763)|
| 1:19:26| You have up to four minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=4766)|
| 1:19:27| Please cooperate with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=4767)|
| 1:19:30| I'm Stuart O'Gwen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=4770)|
| 1:19:31| We live at 7121 Sheffield, which is the corner of Sheffield and West Hills,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=4771)|
| 1:19:37| the famous stop sign where no one stops,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=4777)|
| 1:19:40| and another important source of revenue because your police stop there pretty often.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=4780)|
| 1:19:44| And while I was thinking about what I was going to say tonight, I watched six cars run through that stop sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=4784)|
| 1:19:50| So, anyway, we just moved here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=4790)|
| 1:19:52| I don't know if I have much credibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=4792)|
| 1:19:53| We just moved from Huntington Beach, California, eight months ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=4793)|
| 1:19:56| Welcome to Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=4796)|
| 1:19:58| A community of 300,000 with hotels and a tourist trade and a median home value of 670-some thousand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=4798)|
| 1:20:07| And I'm sure you folks would love to have that revenue stream so that you could give everyone all the sidewalks they want,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=4807)|
| 1:20:14| and we appreciate that you have less to work with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=4814)|
| 1:20:18| However, as you just heard, this is a community that's been here for 60 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=4818)|
| 1:20:25| has been promised sidewalks for 50 years, generations of councils have promised it before you folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=4825)|
| 1:20:32| And I guess what I would like to say is that we moved here to take care of our one-year-old granddaughter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=4832)|
| 1:20:40| our first granddaughter, and she's with us four days a week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=4840)|
| 1:20:44| But in our neighborhood, and as was said, there's young families moving in this neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=4844)|
| 1:20:48| It's not just everyone that's been here for 50 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=4848)|
| 1:20:51| We're old folks, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=4851)|
| 1:20:54| But someday we'd like to be able to see the kids in the neighborhood run their skateboards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=4854)|
| 1:20:58| and their tricycles to the neighbor's house and up and down the streets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=4858)|
| 1:21:01| But right now, the expressway, see it's not a freeway here, it's an expressway, I guess, is like a big dam.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=4861)|
| 1:21:10| And there's only a few niches to get through that dam where the traffic squirts through, and we live on them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=4870)|
| 1:21:16| And believe me, you'd be out of your mind to send your kids out onto Sheffield on their tricycles or their skateboards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=4876)|
| 1:21:25| And if you decide to come, we'll give you one of these T-shirts because you want to be visible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=4885)|
| 1:21:31| That's not a little country road anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=4891)|
| 1:21:34| It's not like when the place was built.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=4894)|
| 1:21:36| So I wish you would, I understand there are other communities that would like sidewalks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=4896)|
| 1:21:41| and I'm sure you folks would love to give everything to everybody that wanted it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=4901)|
| 1:21:46| I'd like to see you move this area up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=4906)|
| 1:21:49| The development up on Middlebrook and down south and north of us is squeezing traffic through,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=4909)|
| 1:21:55| and it's a dangerous place, and I sure don't want to be living on that street corner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=4915)|
| 1:21:59| and look out someday and see a tragedy on my street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=4919)|
| 1:22:03| And you folks can do something about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=4923)|
| 1:22:06| Thanks for your time, and my respects to the council and my neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=4926)|
| 1:22:09| Thank you, sir, and again, welcome to Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=4929)|
| 1:22:15| My name is Carl Cisano.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=4935)|
| 1:22:17| I live in the West Hills neighborhood, 7008 Sheffield Drive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=4937)|
| 1:22:20| and also am the collections coordinator for the Knox County trustee at Shell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=4940)|
| 1:22:24| So Mayor O'Hara and Vice Mayor Grieve and city council members, glad to have just a quick opportunity to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=4944)|
| 1:22:30| We live right on Sheffield Drive, as I said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=4950)|
| 1:22:33| It's a wonderful neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=4953)|
| 1:22:35| It's got a great history.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=4955)|
| 1:22:37| I second what Sandy Robinson said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=4957)|
| 1:22:39| I think we need a sidewalk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=4959)|
| 1:22:42| My interests were probably a little selfish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=4962)|
| 1:22:44| I very much enjoy your pickleball courts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=4964)|
| 1:22:46| and I'd love to be able to take a nice little jog down there on a safe sidewalk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=4966)|
| 1:22:51| There's a lot of people that use this road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=4971)|
| 1:22:54| A lot of people walk on this road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=4974)|
| 1:22:56| A lot of people bike on this road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=4976)|
| 1:22:58| The reason I know that is because my dog barks at everyone that goes by.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=4978)|
| 1:23:02| So it is a heavily trafficked area, and there's a lot of traffic there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=4982)|
| 1:23:07| I think a sidewalk would be very much in line with your vision for Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=4987)|
| 1:23:14| and I think it would make a better neighborhood, which indeed does make a better city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=4994)|
| 1:23:18| So I appreciate the time and the opportunity to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=4998)|
| 1:23:21| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=5001)|
| 1:23:27| Okay, next is David Hayes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=5007)|
| 1:23:37| Please state your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=5017)|
| 1:23:39| You have up to four minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=5019)|
| 1:23:40| Thank you for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=5020)|
| 1:23:43| My name is David Hayes, 241 Hawthorne.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=5023)|
| 1:23:47| Oh, my man, Pavlis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=5027)|
| 1:23:49| It is amazing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=5029)|
| 1:23:50| It's like I'm not even trying to pretend that's how I want actual engagement by your citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=5030)|
| 1:23:56| It's astounding that you think that your life is so much more important than everybody else's,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=5036)|
| 1:24:00| like everybody wants to be away from their home and their kids and their families.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=5040)|
| 1:24:04| Like you, your time is what's important and what we must recognize here, even though you signed up for this position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=5044)|
| 1:24:09| So shame on you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=5049)|
| 1:24:10| I'm trying to shut down public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=5050)|
| 1:24:12| That's not right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=5052)|
| 1:24:14| Just wanted to get that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=5054)|
| 1:24:15| There's eight councilmen left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=5055)|
| 1:24:18| Yeah, so I just want to get through with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=5058)|
| 1:24:21| So I think it's almost just – not almost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=5061)|
| 1:24:23| It is suspectable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=5063)|
| 1:24:25| It's like how racism and oppression and classism, just like what's going on in this city, y'all?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=5065)|
| 1:24:30| Like how y'all treat – how y'all even talk about folks, homeless folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=5070)|
| 1:24:35| It's just amazing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=5075)|
| 1:24:38| Nick Volpe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=5078)|
| 1:24:40| I'm sorry if I mispronounced your name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=5080)|
| 1:24:41| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=5081)|
| 1:24:42| So the email you sent out calling people in the homeless collective like insects, grasshoppers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=5082)|
| 1:24:48| This is like wow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=5088)|
| 1:24:49| It's like you honestly think that you can call people insects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=5089)|
| 1:24:52| You think that's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=5092)|
| 1:24:54| Trying to give advice like you know everything and the people actually advocating for their life,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=5094)|
| 1:24:58| advocating for a bill of rights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=5098)|
| 1:25:00| It's crazy that people have to come here time after time and advocate for human rights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=5100)|
| 1:25:05| This is what they're advocating for, human rights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=5105)|
| 1:25:08| I didn't call you insects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=5108)|
| 1:25:09| I was talking about a fable that teaches a lesson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=5109)|
| 1:25:11| Wait, whose time is this to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=5111)|
| 1:25:12| Whose time is this to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=5112)|
| 1:25:13| Did I not just sit here all this time and listen to y'all ramble?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=5113)|
| 1:25:17| Come on, y'all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=5117)|
| 1:25:18| Y'all need to understand that if you actually want to pretend like you care about what people are talking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=5118)|
| 1:25:22| you need to actually listen to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=5122)|
| 1:25:24| So I'm talking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=5124)|
| 1:25:25| And the fact that y'all want to shut down, when so many people come up here bleeding their hearts out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=5125)|
| 1:25:30| and telling y'all what's real, it's just the separation from the community here is just really evident.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=5130)|
| 1:25:37| It's even evident in this room, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=5137)|
| 1:25:39| So we have a process here where y'all get here and talk, and y'all talk, and y'all talk to people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=5139)|
| 1:25:44| and somebody dares say something back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=5144)|
| 1:25:46| Somebody just stand up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=5146)|
| 1:25:48| A black man stands up and looks over here, and then we've got the cops coming,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=5148)|
| 1:25:52| and then we have like three cops.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=5152)|
| 1:25:53| I think there's two right now, but three cops surrounding the black people, only three black people right here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=5153)|
| 1:25:57| just for standing up and then having the audacity to engage in this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=5157)|
| 1:26:01| But as Nick pointed out, I don't think that's actual true intentions here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=5161)|
| 1:26:05| I think the true intentions is running with an agenda that y'all have that doesn't actually include the people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=5165)|
| 1:26:09| like an identification effort or the Magnolia Plan, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=5169)|
| 1:26:13| So we actually came to y'all saying we have all these criticisms,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=5173)|
| 1:26:16| and actually not any of those are actually being met.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=5176)|
| 1:26:19| We just came here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=5179)|
| 1:26:20| I even wrote it out just to say it simply.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=5180)|
| 1:26:23| One of the things we're talking about is there is no guarantees that the people who actually live in this area of Magnolia| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=5183)|
| 1:26:29| that's going to be developed will actually have and own and control the wealth created there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=5189)|
| 1:26:35| That's some basic stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=5195)|
| 1:26:37| Nothing that y'all said, nothing that y'all said hasn't ensured that the people there will have a place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=5197)|
| 1:26:42| and the wealth that y'all want to create there and that people won't get pushed out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=5202)|
| 1:26:45| You have one minute, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=5205)|
| 1:26:47| Yeah, one minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=5207)|
| 1:26:49| You know, I think it's an interesting social experiment to see, like, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=5209)|
| 1:26:52| how racism and everything operates in our everyday lives, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=5212)|
| 1:26:56| So there's exercise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=5216)|
| 1:26:57| So it's like a white lady comes up here, speaks about one minute longer, and it's totally fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=5217)|
| 1:27:02| Now, I wonder how long it would take for me to get escorted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=5222)|
| 1:27:10| I'm not going to attest that, but, you know, I don't really feel like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=5230)|
| 1:27:13| because I want to mention something else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=5233)|
| 1:27:15| Mayor, it's crazy that – that's an ableist way to talk about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=5235)|
| 1:27:18| But it's – it amazes me that you try to be such a progressive mayor, but yet you don't even, like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=5238)|
| 1:27:23| you can't even catch on to the trends, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=5243)|
| 1:27:25| We have two bathrooms right here, male and female.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=5245)|
| 1:27:28| Why can they not be for all genders, any genders, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=5248)|
| 1:27:34| Why are you – why do you purposely keep erasing the trans experience?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=5254)|
| 1:27:38| Because Knoxville has lots of – I don't know if y'all know, in the districts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=5258)|
| 1:27:41| I should know this, trans people, people who don't conform to a gender,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=5261)|
| 1:27:45| people who have different sex, all this stuff, have existed here long before –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=5265)|
| 1:27:49| long, long before y'all just becoming knowledgeable of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=5269)|
| 1:27:53| And the fact that you have two bathrooms right there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=5273)|
| 1:27:55| you didn't even think about putting all genders on both of those, it amazes me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=5275)|
| 1:28:00| Sir, your time is up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=5280)|
| 1:28:02| Have fun supporting Hillary Clinton, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=5282)|
| 1:28:04| Thank you. I will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=5284)|
| 1:28:07| Okay. Next is – we have Martha Allred.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=5287)|
| 1:28:18| Followed by Drew Krickow. Did I pronounce it right this time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=5298)|
| 1:28:24| Okay. And Ned Anderson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=5304)|
| 1:28:26| And, again, thank you for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=5306)|
| 1:28:28| State your name and address for the record, and you have up to four minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=5308)|
| 1:28:32| Martha Allred.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=5312)|
| 1:28:34| Homeless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=5314)|
| 1:28:36| I have no place to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=5316)|
| 1:28:38| I owe over $2,000 for KUB.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=5318)|
| 1:28:44| It's not my fault.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=5324)|
| 1:28:46| It's irrelevant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=5326)|
| 1:28:47| I owe KCDC 500 after being evicted for defending myself of assault of my partner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=5327)|
| 1:28:55| Again, there's no reason in the element.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=5335)|
| 1:28:58| I am pertinently banned from CARM.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=5338)|
| 1:29:01| I used bad language with staff member who was looking at my daughter in the wrong way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=5341)|
| 1:29:07| Made me feel uncomfortable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=5347)|
| 1:29:08| I realize I can't answer in public forum section, but I can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=5348)|
| 1:29:28| You're doing fine, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=5368)|
| 1:29:30| You can't answer me in this public forum section.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=5370)|
| 1:29:34| You can't answer me in this public forum section.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=5374)|
| 1:29:37| But I can dialogue with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=5377)|
| 1:29:39| But I can dialogue with you because we won't put this on an issue agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=5379)|
| 1:29:45| but we would like you to sit here and think about the answers you would give me to this question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=5385)|
| 1:29:54| Then tell me where can I go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=5394)|
| 1:29:59| Ma'am, if you would like to talk after the meeting, I'd be glad to talk to you, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=5399)|
| 1:30:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=5405)|
| 1:30:13| Next is Drew Crickhow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=5413)|
| 1:30:27| Drew Crickhow, currently homeless in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=5427)|
| 1:30:33| Got a reply to our homeless bill of rights that we've been trying to pass,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=5433)|
| 1:30:40| and we wouldn't have to keep coming here week after week after week if we were actually taken seriously in this matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=5440)|
| 1:30:49| Dear collective, thanks for your note.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=5449)|
| 1:30:52| There is an annual budget process that starts with the mayor and will be reviewed by council later in the month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=5452)|
| 1:30:58| That budget will be on an agenda and debated by mid-June.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=5458)|
| 1:31:03| There are funds to provide aid to organizations that help the homeless in our city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=5463)|
| 1:31:08| I am surprised by your asserted quote-unquote outrage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=5468)|
| 1:31:13| Hardworking taxpayers are being taxed to provide monies to help support homeless services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=5473)|
| 1:31:20| This is intended as a hand up to folks falling on hard times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=5480)|
| 1:31:25| It is well-intended charity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=5485)|
| 1:31:28| It is your job to take control and straighten your life out, to get a job to support yourself and your family,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=5488)|
| 1:31:35| and hopefully to contribute something useful to society.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=5495)|
| 1:31:40| We are put on this earth for a purpose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=5500)|
| 1:31:43| In my view, there should be no permanent free ride.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=5503)|
| 1:31:48| Frankly, your quote-unquote demands show a gross lack of perception on your anonymous quote-unquote collective part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=5508)|
| 1:31:58| Perhaps the ancient fable of the ant and the grasshopper still has relevance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=5518)|
| 1:32:03| The fun-loving grasshopper, who played the fiddle all summer and put nothing in store for the winter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=5523)|
| 1:32:09| passed away once the cold winter hit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=5529)|
| 1:32:12| while the industrious ants slept warmly in their prepared underground and stocked shelter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=5532)|
| 1:32:18| Learn from those ants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=5538)|
| 1:32:20| They had to work for their future living.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=5540)|
| 1:32:23| This incoherent, irrelevant, condescending email was written by someone who actually helps run the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=5543)|
| 1:32:34| God help us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=5554)|
| 1:32:36| I'm not living in a fable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=5556)|
| 1:32:39| This is real life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=5559)|
| 1:32:41| A raw life that you nor a grasshopper know anything about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=5561)|
| 1:32:47| Try being homeless and a felon in Knox County and try to get a job with that kind of record following you around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=5567)|
| 1:32:55| Try to get any kind of government subsidy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=5575)|
| 1:32:57| Try to get any kind of funding or housing in this town, in this county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=5577)|
| 1:33:02| when you've got a stack of felonies following you around everywhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=5582)|
| 1:33:07| It's obvious you have no idea what we're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=5587)|
| 1:33:11| We're not asking to be on some budget agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=5591)|
| 1:33:14| We're asking to be taken seriously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=5594)|
| 1:33:17| We're not asking to stay homeless forever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=5597)|
| 1:33:20| We're asking to be allowed to be able to exist while we seek these helps that are supposedly given us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=5600)|
| 1:33:29| to where we can get off the streets, where we can get off our bus, can get out of our tents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=5609)|
| 1:33:35| to be a productive member of society, hopefully.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=5615)|
| 1:33:39| I don't want to be homeless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=5619)|
| 1:33:41| This sucks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=5621)|
| 1:33:43| I dare any one of you to put your credit cards down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=5623)|
| 1:33:48| Put your banks down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=5628)|
| 1:33:51| Turn your car keys in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=5631)|
| 1:33:53| Give up your soft clothing and live the life of a homeless person for one month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=5633)|
| 1:33:58| and we'll see how well you do when no one is going to pay any attention to you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=5638)|
| 1:34:03| when no one is going to answer any questions you have seriously,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=5643)|
| 1:34:07| but just would rather turn your head, turn your back, and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=5647)|
| 1:34:10| well, there's helps out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=5650)|
| 1:34:12| You just need to do it for yourself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=5652)|
| 1:34:14| This sickens me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=5654)|
| 1:34:16| Thank you for having me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=5656)|
| 1:34:22| Anderson, can you please state your name and address for the record?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=5662)|
| 1:34:26| You have up to four minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=5666)|
| 1:34:27| My name is Jenedris Anderson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=5667)|
| 1:34:29| They call me Ned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=5669)|
| 1:34:31| Well, my mail goes to 1801 Amherst.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=5671)|
| 1:34:34| That's where my friend allows me to get my mail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=5674)|
| 1:34:37| But like that, the email he sent, that was ridiculous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=5677)|
| 1:34:43| See, this little supposedly grasshopper, he has a job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=5683)|
| 1:34:48| But like my man said, I got like one felony, and boom, it's causing me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=5688)|
| 1:34:55| I can't get housing with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=5695)|
| 1:34:57| I can't get like help through KCDC or CARM.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=5697)|
| 1:35:01| But for him to even say that, I thank you for the time to let me speak| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=5701)|
| 1:35:05| because I was going to say what I had to say if I didn't get to have the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=5705)|
| 1:35:10| But thank you for allowing us to speak because you need to hear this, man.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=5710)|
| 1:35:14| Your brain must be the size of a pea to write that to a human person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=5714)|
| 1:35:18| I'm a human being, and all of us are human.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=5718)|
| 1:35:21| If you cut us open, we all going to bleed the same dumb color, everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160510?start=5721)|
