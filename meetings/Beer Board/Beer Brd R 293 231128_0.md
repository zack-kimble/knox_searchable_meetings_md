| 0:10:35| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231128?start=635)|
| 0:10:37| So in the past, you guys have just been takeout and pizza?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231128?start=637)|
| 0:10:40| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231128?start=640)|
| 0:10:41| We are takeout and delivery, and we have a room that we emptied out, and it's like where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231128?start=641)|
| 0:10:46| the front door is and we're turning into like a small little grocery store.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231128?start=646)|
| 0:10:51| Not a grocery store, but like a little stop to shop type deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231128?start=651)|
| 0:10:55| So you'll be fronting Broadway now and using that entrance there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231128?start=655)|
| 0:11:00| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231128?start=660)|

| 0:11:06| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231128?start=666)|
| 0:11:07| There's some high windows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231128?start=667)|

| 0:11:48| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231128?start=708)|

| 0:11:54| Things are going very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231128?start=714)|
| 0:11:55| Business is busy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231128?start=715)|
| 0:11:57| We have the restaurant and bar running, opening, and everything's good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231128?start=717)|
| 0:12:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231128?start=721)|
| 0:12:02| I'm going to ask for a 90-day extension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231128?start=722)|
| 0:12:08| Looks like you guys have a few things left to get, but it sounds like you're making some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231128?start=728)|
| 0:12:12| progress.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231128?start=732)|
| 0:12:13| Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231128?start=733)|
| 0:12:14| Yes, that is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231128?start=734)|
| 0:12:15| The application is in process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231128?start=735)|
| 0:12:16| So I'll make a motion for a 90-day extension, just so you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231128?start=736)|
| 0:12:20| If you finish early, you can always turn everything in and pick it up early.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231128?start=740)|
| 0:12:24| It just gives you extra time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231128?start=744)|
| 0:12:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231128?start=745)|
| 0:12:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231128?start=746)|
| 0:12:27| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231128?start=747)|
| 0:12:28| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231128?start=748)|
| 0:12:29| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231128?start=749)|
| 0:12:30| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231128?start=750)|
| 0:12:31| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231128?start=751)|
| 0:12:32| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231128?start=752)|
| 0:12:33| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231128?start=753)|
| 0:12:34| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231128?start=754)|
| 0:12:35| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231128?start=755)|

| 0:12:37| Good luck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231128?start=757)|
| 0:12:38| Next, we've got Dash and Go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231128?start=758)|
| 0:12:39| Hello and welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231128?start=759)|
| 0:12:40| Hello.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231128?start=760)|
| 0:12:41| Tamalyn Harper is my name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231128?start=761)|
| 0:12:42| 2128 East Magnolia Avenue is where Dash and Go is located.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231128?start=762)|
| 0:12:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231128?start=773)|
| 0:12:54| And how are things going with you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231128?start=774)|
| 0:12:56| Well, the store itself is progressing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231128?start=776)|
| 0:13:01| The thing that I'm having problems with is I've come several times up to the permit office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231128?start=781)|
| 0:13:09| so I have no idea about the permits, to get help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231128?start=789)|
| 0:13:12| And when they do help me, they are very nice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231128?start=792)|
| 0:13:15| They do help me, but what's going on is every time we apply for the permits, they're telling| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231128?start=795)|
| 0:13:20| me I need, then they're pulled because they're saying I needed something else, which I have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231128?start=800)|
| 0:13:26| no idea until they tell me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231128?start=806)|
| 0:13:28| So that's kind of where I am now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231128?start=808)|
| 0:13:30| They're telling me now that I need a different permit from what I was told before, previously,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231128?start=810)|
| 0:13:41| and that now I'm going to need an architect when they previously told me to draw up the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231128?start=821)|
| 0:13:45| plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231128?start=825)|
| 0:13:46| So for the store itself, they're saying the building, the entire building is different| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231128?start=826)|
| 0:13:52| from what they knew from the previous owners, which was probably in the 70s of what the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231128?start=832)|
| 0:13:59| business was listed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231128?start=839)|
| 0:14:00| So I'm just having those hurdles as far as getting the permit for them to come and do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231128?start=840)|
| 0:14:08| the final inspections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231128?start=848)|
| 0:14:11| I need the extension because it is actually now costing us more money because, like I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231128?start=851)|
| 0:14:18| say, I've been up here several times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231128?start=858)|
| 0:14:20| I've applied for whatever it is, the permits they tell me that I need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231128?start=860)|
| 0:14:25| Once we are submitting this, then I'll get an email telling me it's the wrong thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231128?start=865)|
| 0:14:29| which I'm only coming up here asking for help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231128?start=869)|
| 0:14:34| They direct me on what I need, or so I think, only to be told I need something different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231128?start=874)|
| 0:14:40| So that's where I am, just waiting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231128?start=880)|
| 0:14:43| Like I say, now I have to get an architect, so I do need the extension to come in and,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231128?start=883)|
| 0:14:48| I guess, draw up plans for the entire building instead of just for the store.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231128?start=888)|
| 0:14:53| Okay, thank you for sharing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231128?start=893)|
| 0:14:55| Council Member Ryder?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231128?start=895)|
| 0:14:58| I would just like to, Council Member McKenzie is here, I don't know if she wants to weigh| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231128?start=898)|
| 0:15:03| in, but I'd like to make a suggestion that we could connect her with Mr. Rosenberg and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231128?start=903)|
| 0:15:08| have him help her because he's working with the building department on this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231128?start=908)|
| 0:15:13| And I think we need to have somebody help you with some customer service on that so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231128?start=913)|
| 0:15:20| we can give him your info.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231128?start=920)|
| 0:15:23| I think that might be the easiest, but that would be my suggestion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231128?start=923)|
| 0:15:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231128?start=928)|
| 0:15:29| All right, so thinking 90-day extension, or is that, you think that would be fair?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231128?start=929)|
| 0:15:40| I think the 90-day would be fair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231128?start=940)|
| 0:15:42| We are working toward what it is now that they have us doing, like I say, as far as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231128?start=942)|
| 0:15:47| providing the architect, we've had contact with one, he come out, looked at the building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231128?start=947)|
| 0:15:53| so hopefully we can get these plans drawn up, submitted, and go from there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231128?start=953)|
| 0:15:59| But like I say, I have tried, because it was foreign to me, so I came up to actually the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231128?start=959)|
| 0:16:05| permit office several times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231128?start=965)|
| 0:16:07| Matter of fact, I've come up to Mr. Byrd a few times because I don't know exactly what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231128?start=967)|
| 0:16:12| I need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231128?start=972)|
| 0:16:13| So the first thing I'm going by is telling them what I have, and they're telling me what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231128?start=973)|
| 0:16:17| I need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231128?start=977)|
| 0:16:18| But of course, like I say, it changes, and they're pulling the permits, and now they're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231128?start=978)|
| 0:16:24| telling me I need a different with the architect, so I do need the 90-day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231128?start=984)|
| 0:16:31| We could connect you to get some help and see if we can expedite the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231128?start=991)|
| 0:16:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231128?start=996)|
| 0:16:37| Do we have a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231128?start=997)|
| 0:16:38| I'll make a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231128?start=998)|
| 0:16:39| Yeah, I'll make a motion to extend 90 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231128?start=999)|
| 0:16:40| I'll second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231128?start=1000)|

| 0:17:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231128?start=1046)|
| 0:17:27| How are things?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231128?start=1047)|
| 0:17:30| Any progress since we saw you last?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231128?start=1050)|
| 0:17:33| Nick?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231128?start=1053)|
| 0:17:34| Hi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231128?start=1054)|
| 0:17:35| My name is Nick Florentine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231128?start=1055)|
| 0:17:37| I'm one of the contractors on the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231128?start=1057)|
| 0:17:40| Yes, there has been progress.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231128?start=1060)|
| 0:17:44| We finally got the drawings done, approved, and the parts were ordered and have come in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231128?start=1064)|
| 0:17:54| Now, we're getting back to work on it to get it finished.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231128?start=1074)|
| 0:17:59| We should have it done before the first of the year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231128?start=1079)|
| 0:18:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231128?start=1082)|
| 0:18:03| Can you state your address for the record as well, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231128?start=1083)|
| 0:18:06| My address is 109 Defoe Road, Andersonville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231128?start=1086)|
| 0:18:10| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231128?start=1090)|
| 0:18:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231128?start=1091)|
| 0:18:12| Council Member Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231128?start=1092)|
| 0:18:15| Hi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231128?start=1095)|
| 0:18:18| I went by a while ago, and I was able to take a picture through the window.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231128?start=1098)|
| 0:18:22| I see lights on, and I think, what are the coolers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231128?start=1102)|
| 0:18:25| It's a very finished-looking space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231128?start=1105)|
| 0:18:29| What's left to do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231128?start=1109)|
| 0:18:30| I was walking around a little bit trying to see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231128?start=1110)|
| 0:18:33| That is why I was late, actually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231128?start=1113)|
| 0:18:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231128?start=1115)|
| 0:18:36| The original contractor that had started the project tried to value engineer everything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231128?start=1116)|
| 0:18:44| and because it didn't match the drawings, we had to redo the drawings to match what was there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231128?start=1124)|
| 0:18:51| It took a little bit of time to get parts ordered because the change in the mechanical code now says that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231128?start=1131)|
| 0:19:00| that size heating and air unit has to have an economizer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231128?start=1140)|
| 0:19:05| and because they don't make an economizer for a split unit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231128?start=1145)|
| 0:19:11| what we had to do was we had to design the thing and then get it approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231128?start=1151)|
| 0:19:16| Then after we submitted the drawings, there were some issues up in the code office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231128?start=1156)|
| 0:19:21| where one of the programmers had messed up all the data,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231128?start=1161)|
| 0:19:27| and so we had to wait for them to fix that before they could get back to looking at the drawings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231128?start=1167)|
| 0:19:33| and getting them approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231128?start=1173)|
| 0:19:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231128?start=1176)|
| 0:19:37| So it's HVAC when you talk about the economizer on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231128?start=1177)|
| 0:19:41| That's the HVAC equipment that you're waiting on parts for?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231128?start=1181)|
| 0:19:45| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231128?start=1185)|
| 0:19:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231128?start=1186)|
| 0:19:47| We finally got everything in this past week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231128?start=1187)|
| 0:19:49| So you have the parts in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231128?start=1189)|
| 0:19:50| You're not waiting on them any longer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231128?start=1190)|
| 0:19:52| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231128?start=1192)|
| 0:19:53| Everything came in last week, and so now we're just waiting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231128?start=1193)|
| 0:20:00| Well, I'm already in there finishing up my electrical and getting ready to wire up the economizer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231128?start=1200)|
| 0:20:07| The mechanical contractor, I talked to him this morning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231128?start=1207)|
| 0:20:10| and he is trying to get his crew scheduled to get in there and get the parts installed on the HVAC system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231128?start=1210)|
| 0:20:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231128?start=1219)|
| 0:20:20| So you don't see any other stall-outs or barriers between now and December 31st?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231128?start=1220)|
| 0:20:27| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231128?start=1227)|
| 0:20:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231128?start=1228)|
| 0:20:29| Plans are approved?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231128?start=1229)|
| 0:20:30| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231128?start=1230)|
| 0:20:31| Permits are issued?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231128?start=1231)|
| 0:20:32| We're not in the queue waiting on a plans review?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231128?start=1232)|
| 0:20:34| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231128?start=1234)|
| 0:20:35| It was just parts?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231128?start=1235)|
| 0:20:36| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231128?start=1236)|
| 0:20:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231128?start=1237)|
| 0:20:38| I'm just being really discerning about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231128?start=1238)|
| 0:20:40| We've never given any beer permit this many extensions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231128?start=1240)|
| 0:20:46| but I thought from the outside of the building that they were nowhere near because it's boarded up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231128?start=1246)|
| 0:20:52| but I saw that the boards are just to protect the glass because there's—| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231128?start=1252)|
| 0:20:56| Yes, because somebody had busted out the glass on the doors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231128?start=1256)|
| 0:20:59| and I had to have my glacier come in and replace the glass on the door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231128?start=1259)|
| 0:21:04| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231128?start=1264)|
| 0:21:05| And we didn't want to take a chance on somebody busting out a brand-new set of glass doors or anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231128?start=1265)|
| 0:21:10| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231128?start=1270)|
| 0:21:11| I saw that it's ready to go, and that's why I said the lights are on in the cooler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231128?start=1271)|
| 0:21:14| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231128?start=1274)|
| 0:21:15| I was pressing my face to the glass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231128?start=1275)|
| 0:21:16| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231128?start=1276)|
| 0:21:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231128?start=1277)|
| 0:21:18| The other thing we ran into was our architect passed away in the spring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231128?start=1278)|
| 0:21:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231128?start=1285)|
| 0:21:27| And so we had to get special permission to submit drawings in a roundabout way to codes—| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231128?start=1287)|
| 0:21:36| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231128?start=1296)|
| 0:21:37| —for them to do the review of the revised drawings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231128?start=1297)|
| 0:21:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231128?start=1302)|
| 0:21:44| Yes, it's been an interesting adventure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231128?start=1304)|
| 0:21:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231128?start=1309)|
| 0:21:50| I'm going to ask Mr. Frost, I can make a motion for a 30-day extension,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231128?start=1310)|
| 0:21:55| which puts us in the middle of the holidays.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231128?start=1315)|
| 0:21:59| You can make a motion for 30 days, 60 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231128?start=1319)|
| 0:22:02| 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231128?start=1322)|
| 0:22:05| If I make a motion for 30 days, they have to pick up the permit and finish everything out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231128?start=1325)|
| 0:22:11| Are you anticipating it could be beyond January 1?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231128?start=1331)|
| 0:22:14| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231128?start=1334)|
| 0:22:16| You feel that good about it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231128?start=1336)|
| 0:22:17| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231128?start=1337)|
| 0:22:19| I've just got a couple of things left to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231128?start=1339)|
| 0:22:21| and Mechanical said that he's planning on getting in there this week| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231128?start=1341)|
| 0:22:27| and next week and getting his stuff done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231128?start=1347)|
| 0:22:31| The next beer board meeting is in the middle of December, less than 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231128?start=1351)|
| 0:22:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231128?start=1357)|
| 0:22:38| So I might suggest a 60-day, where that would take it to the January beer board meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231128?start=1358)|
| 0:22:48| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231128?start=1368)|
| 0:22:50| Council Member Ryder, if I can also say, they also need to do their CAST class again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231128?start=1370)|
| 0:22:57| because they did it when they initially applied in 2020.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231128?start=1377)|
| 0:23:04| Mr. Manji, I'm sorry if I mispronounced your name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231128?start=1384)|
| 0:23:10| You need to take your TAS class again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231128?start=1390)|
| 0:23:13| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231128?start=1393)|
| 0:23:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231128?start=1395)|
| 0:23:16| So you're going to do that soon as well?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231128?start=1396)|
| 0:23:19| Before 60 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231128?start=1399)|
| 0:23:20| Before 60 days done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231128?start=1400)|
| 0:23:22| Before the new year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231128?start=1402)|
| 0:23:24| Before the new year done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231128?start=1404)|
| 0:23:25| That would be a great idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231128?start=1405)|
| 0:23:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231128?start=1407)|
| 0:23:28| I'll make a motion to extend 60 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231128?start=1408)|
| 0:23:30| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231128?start=1410)|
| 0:23:32| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231128?start=1412)|
| 0:23:33| Do we have a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231128?start=1413)|
| 0:23:37| Oh, sorry, I didn't hear you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231128?start=1417)|
| 0:23:39| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231128?start=1419)|
| 0:23:40| Any further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231128?start=1420)|
| 0:23:41| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231128?start=1421)|
| 0:23:42| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231128?start=1422)|

| 0:24:06| Barrett, have you heard from him?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231128?start=1446)|
| 0:24:08| I did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231128?start=1448)|
| 0:24:10| This either yesterday or today, he replied to one of my little reminder| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231128?start=1450)|
| 0:24:14| emails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231128?start=1454)|
| 0:24:16| I thought he was coming or sending someone if he wasn't able to make it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231128?start=1456)|
| 0:24:21| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231128?start=1461)|
| 0:24:22| We'll finish the agenda and see if he happens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231128?start=1462)|
| 0:24:25| Next up is Hyatt Place, Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231128?start=1465)|
| 0:24:27| Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231128?start=1467)|
| 0:24:32| Trenton Keelan, 530 South K Street, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37902.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231128?start=1472)|
| 0:24:37| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231128?start=1477)|
| 0:24:38| How are things going?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231128?start=1478)|
| 0:24:39| Things are going good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231128?start=1479)|
| 0:24:41| Here tonight seeking an extension, be it with the holidays, seeking a 60-day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231128?start=1481)|
| 0:24:49| Basically where we're at is we have to get an inspection completed so that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231128?start=1489)|
| 0:24:55| can finalize and obtain the CO.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231128?start=1495)|
| 0:24:58| The inspection requires us to have somebody come out and schedule that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231128?start=1498)|
| 0:25:04| independent person and then submit through the architect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231128?start=1504)|
| 0:25:07| So it's a lot of moving parts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231128?start=1507)|
| 0:25:10| Unfortunately, in the last week, unrelated to all of this, we've had a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231128?start=1510)|
| 0:25:12| lot of major mechanical issues in the building that kind of canceled and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231128?start=1512)|
| 0:25:16| moved things around for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231128?start=1516)|
| 0:25:19| At this point, we should be able to get it done with no anticipated issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231128?start=1519)|
| 0:25:22| in the next couple weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231128?start=1522)|
| 0:25:24| But being that we are running into a meeting that's in the middle of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231128?start=1524)|
| 0:25:27| December, I would ask for a 60-day if possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231128?start=1527)|
| 0:25:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231128?start=1531)|
| 0:25:32| Council Member McKenzie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231128?start=1532)|
| 0:25:37| One of the things that you mentioned it sounds like it's definitely a lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231128?start=1537)|
| 0:25:40| of moving parts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231128?start=1540)|
| 0:25:42| Would a 90-day extension better suit your needs and then that way if you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231128?start=1542)|
| 0:25:45| complete it within 60, you're fine and don't have to ask for another| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231128?start=1545)|
| 0:25:49| extension?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231128?start=1549)|
| 0:25:51| I mean, I'd certainly be okay with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231128?start=1551)|
| 0:25:53| I don't think we'll have any problems getting it in 60, but if it is better| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231128?start=1553)|
| 0:25:58| on everyone's time and kind of the process for 90 and we can always come| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231128?start=1558)|
| 0:26:03| in sooner, we'd be fine with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231128?start=1563)|
| 0:26:06| It's up to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231128?start=1566)|
| 0:26:07| Do you want 60 or 90?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231128?start=1567)|
| 0:26:09| 60 is fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231128?start=1569)|
| 0:26:11| I came in thinking 60, so that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231128?start=1571)|
| 0:26:13| We weren't even considering 90, so 60 should be good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231128?start=1573)|
| 0:26:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231128?start=1576)|
| 0:26:17| I'll move to approve a 60-day extension pending final documentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231128?start=1577)|
| 0:26:20| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231128?start=1580)|
| 0:26:22| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231128?start=1582)|
| 0:26:23| Any other discussion, questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231128?start=1583)|
| 0:26:25| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231128?start=1585)|
| 0:26:26| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231128?start=1586)|
| 0:26:27| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231128?start=1587)|
| 0:26:28| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231128?start=1588)|
| 0:26:30| Good luck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231128?start=1590)|
| 0:26:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231128?start=1591)|
| 0:26:32| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231128?start=1592)|
| 0:26:33| Next is Tianda E.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231128?start=1593)|
| 0:26:35| Carnicerio-Lobonita.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231128?start=1595)|
| 0:26:37| Welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231128?start=1597)|
| 0:26:47| My name is Luis Soto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231128?start=1607)|
| 0:26:49| We're located at 4101 Brewpin Road, and that's in Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231128?start=1609)|
| 0:26:53| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231128?start=1613)|
| 0:26:54| Do you have an update?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231128?start=1614)|
| 0:26:55| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231128?start=1615)|
| 0:26:56| So we had submitted for a plans review, and we forgot to put the gas line| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231128?start=1616)|
| 0:27:02| that was going to be installed on it the first time, so it made us restart again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231128?start=1622)|
| 0:27:07| So right now the only thing that's left to be reviewed is the building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231128?start=1627)|
| 0:27:12| and then we can start with the next step.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231128?start=1632)|
| 0:27:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231128?start=1639)|
| 0:27:22| So do you have an idea about how long you think it might take?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231128?start=1642)|
| 0:27:28| So the buildings, they've taken about a month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231128?start=1648)|
| 0:27:31| So once they do their review, we can start going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231128?start=1651)|
| 0:27:35| So 60 days might make a recommendation that we do 90 days on this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231128?start=1655)|
| 0:27:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231128?start=1663)|
| 0:27:44| Council Member Smith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231128?start=1664)|
| 0:27:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231128?start=1665)|
| 0:27:46| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231128?start=1666)|
| 0:27:47| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231128?start=1667)|
| 0:27:48| I've got a motion and a second to extend 90 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231128?start=1668)|
| 0:27:51| That would be good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231128?start=1671)|
| 0:27:52| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231128?start=1672)|
| 0:27:53| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231128?start=1673)|
| 0:27:54| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231128?start=1674)|
| 0:27:55| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231128?start=1675)|
| 0:27:56| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231128?start=1676)|
| 0:27:57| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231128?start=1677)|
| 0:27:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231128?start=1678)|
| 0:27:59| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231128?start=1679)|
| 0:28:00| Good luck to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231128?start=1680)|
| 0:28:01| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231128?start=1681)|
| 0:28:02| And then Tienda La Estrellita has chosen to withdraw their application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231128?start=1682)|
| 0:28:09| Is that correct, Mr. Byrd?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231128?start=1689)|
| 0:28:10| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231128?start=1690)|
| 0:28:11| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231128?start=1691)|
| 0:28:12| Thank you for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231128?start=1692)|
| 0:28:13| So back to FANBASE 2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231128?start=1693)|
| 0:28:16| Mr. Villas?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231128?start=1696)|
| 0:28:18| Anybody from FANBASE 2 here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231128?start=1698)|
| 0:28:23| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231128?start=1703)|
| 0:28:28| Do we have a recommendation to postpone or defer him?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231128?start=1708)|
| 0:28:33| My suggestion on this one, the concern I had was this was originally approved back in December| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231128?start=1713)|
| 0:28:39| of last year, I guess, so it's where we're getting close to a year, so they need to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231128?start=1719)|
| 0:28:46| their class again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231128?start=1726)|
| 0:28:48| Are they getting close to a year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231128?start=1728)|
| 0:28:50| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231128?start=1730)|
| 0:28:52| They took the class November 17th of 2022.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231128?start=1732)|
| 0:28:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231128?start=1737)|
| 0:28:58| So I'm going to want them to take the class again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231128?start=1738)|
| 0:29:00| Mr. Byrd, can you let them know that I'm going to give them a 30-day extension?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231128?start=1740)|
