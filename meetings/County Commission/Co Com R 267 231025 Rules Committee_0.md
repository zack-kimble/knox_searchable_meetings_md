| 0:00:50| Commissioner Frank? Present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=50)|
| 0:00:52| All right. We're on to number two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=52)|
| 0:00:55| I do have some amendments and a couple of additions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=55)|
| 0:00:58| If you will please note, the first amendment is to number seven.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=58)|
| 0:01:02| I need to include that it states Rule 1, Board of Commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=62)|
| 0:01:08| Also, number nine needs to include Rule 5, Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=68)|
| 0:01:14| And then I have two discussion items to add after number nine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=74)|
| 0:01:19| The discussion item is simply adding a word to one of the titles of Rule 5| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=79)|
| 0:01:26| and also adding a discussion item of an attendance policy for both the Committee and Rule 5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=86)|
| 0:01:33| Everybody got that? All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=93)|
| 0:01:37| Then we move on to the approval of the minutes from the previous meeting of April 17| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=97)|
| 0:01:42| and also September 1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=102)|
| 0:01:44| April was not approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=104)|
| 0:01:47| We're going to do this separately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=107)|
| 0:01:49| First number. Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=109)|
| 0:01:52| All right. We have a motion by Jay, a second by Elster for the April 17th minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=112)|
| 0:01:58| All those in favor? Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=118)|
| 0:02:00| Do I have a proper motion to approve the minutes from the September 1st meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=120)|
| 0:02:04| So moved. Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=124)|
| 0:02:06| A motion by Jay, second by Elster to approve the September 1st meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=126)|
| 0:02:10| All those in favor? Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=130)|
| 0:02:12| Great. Do we have anyone here for public forum?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=132)|
| 0:02:15| Any agenda items?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=135)|
| 0:02:18| We do not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=138)|
| 0:02:20| All right. Do I have any discussion and considerations of any recommendations?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=140)|
| 0:02:24| Do you all have anything you would like to add?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=144)|
| 0:02:28| I don't see any.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=148)|
| 0:02:30| We move on to number six.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=150)|
| 0:02:32| Discussion and consideration of adding X to Knox County Ethics Policy to Rule 1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=152)|
| 0:02:38| Board of Commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=158)|
| 0:02:40| So this was, this is one of mine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=160)|
| 0:02:45| So let's go to Rule 1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=165)|
| 0:02:50| Board of Commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=170)|
| 0:02:52| We simply want to add X with either the Code of Ethics Policy or a reference to the policy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=172)|
| 0:03:01| that we all adhere to, the Knox County Code of Ethics Policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=181)|
| 0:03:07| So that is simply just adding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=187)|
| 0:03:10| We can either add the entire policy there or we can add one or two sentences stating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=190)|
| 0:03:16| that we adhere to and abide by the Knox County Code of Ethics Policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=196)|
| 0:03:21| Which we do anyway because we're employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=201)|
| 0:03:25| Right, right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=205)|
| 0:03:27| But I want it in here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=207)|
| 0:03:29| I think you just put a reference to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=209)|
| 0:03:31| Yeah. We abide by Knox County Ethics Policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=211)|
| 0:03:34| C policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=214)|
| 0:03:36| C policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=216)|
| 0:03:39| Any other discussion about that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=219)|
| 0:03:42| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=222)|
| 0:03:44| Do we have a proper motion to include Rule 1, X, a reference to adhering?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=224)|
| 0:03:56| Motion to add Rule X.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=236)|
| 0:03:59| Did somebody start that already?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=239)|
| 0:04:00| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=240)|
| 0:04:01| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=241)|
| 0:04:02| Motion to add Section X stating that we adhere to the Knox County Ethics Policy under Rule 1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=242)|
| 0:04:12| Great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=252)|
| 0:04:13| I have a motion by Jay, a second by Derrick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=253)|
| 0:04:16| Do we have all in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=256)|
| 0:04:18| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=258)|
| 0:04:19| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=259)|
| 0:04:20| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=260)|
| 0:04:21| Motion passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=261)|
| 0:04:22| Thank you all very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=262)|
| 0:04:23| Moving on to Number 7.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=263)|
| 0:04:25| Discussion and consideration of Rule 1, Section I, Committee Referrals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=265)|
| 0:04:29| This is really just a discussion item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=269)|
| 0:04:32| And to also ask this committee, I want to expand on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=272)|
| 0:04:36| There were questions recently at some of our work sessions and also our regular meetings about resolutions that were brought forward that we might like to see go back to a committee for further review or research.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=276)|
| 0:04:50| Example, if there's a resolution that's dealing with a piece of legislation, we might say as a body, a commission, we want to refer this to the legislative committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=290)|
| 0:05:04| Or legislative affairs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=304)|
| 0:05:09| That's not for all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=309)|
| 0:05:11| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=311)|
| 0:05:12| That would just be if it comes to the full commission and we want further investigation by a specific committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=312)|
| 0:05:20| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=320)|
| 0:05:21| But we can do that now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=321)|
| 0:05:22| We can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=322)|
| 0:05:23| It's in our rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=323)|
| 0:05:24| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=324)|
| 0:05:25| We can just say, I think this warrants it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=325)|
| 0:05:27| And I may think it needs to go back to legislative committees for more work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=327)|
| 0:05:30| You all may disagree with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=330)|
| 0:05:32| And we take a vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=332)|
| 0:05:33| And it doesn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=333)|
| 0:05:34| Or you guys might say that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=334)|
| 0:05:36| So why do we need to do that now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=336)|
| 0:05:38| Why do we need to put that in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=338)|
| 0:05:40| Again, I brought it forward just as a discussion item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=340)|
| 0:05:43| If we want to take a look at it, if we want to clarify it, or maybe just announce that at the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=343)|
| 0:05:52| So if everybody would take a look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=352)|
| 0:05:57| Rule one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=357)|
| 0:05:58| Rule one, section I.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=358)|
| 0:05:59| Page two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=359)|
| 0:06:00| Yep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=360)|
| 0:06:02| Committee referrals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=362)|
| 0:06:03| It just says, any matter requiring consideration or study by a committee shall be referred to the appropriate committee by the commission chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=363)|
| 0:06:12| Do we want to change any language there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=372)|
| 0:06:14| Do we want it to be, OK, I vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=374)|
| 0:06:18| Adhere to just only the chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=378)|
| 0:06:22| Oh, I see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=382)|
| 0:06:24| Shall be referred to the appropriate committee by the commission chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=384)|
| 0:06:29| Or by full commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=389)|
| 0:06:31| Or by majority vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=391)|
| 0:06:33| Or by majority vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=393)|
| 0:06:35| I would do it or, because the chair may say, I don't see a lot of consensus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=395)|
| 0:06:40| I want to keep this thing down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=400)|
| 0:06:41| There's so many people who want to work on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=401)|
| 0:06:43| And I think that's appropriate in the power of the chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=403)|
| 0:06:46| But I think or by majority vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=406)|
| 0:06:50| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=410)|
| 0:06:53| Yes, Madam Chair?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=413)|
| 0:06:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=414)|
| 0:06:55| Do you have a comment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=415)|
| 0:06:57| Yes, we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=417)|
| 0:06:59| I was thinking this originally came about because observing some other districts and places in our state who, when they have specific subject matters, maybe it's legislative, that it's an automatic that it goes to that committee first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=419)|
| 0:07:23| And it's kind of vetted before it comes to the full body to vote on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=443)|
| 0:07:31| So when I saw that, I was sort of thinking that might be the intent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=451)|
| 0:07:36| Whereas I think I'm hearing you all say that it comes to the board and then the decision is made whether to kick it back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=456)|
| 0:07:44| Just a comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=464)|
| 0:07:46| That's a very good point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=466)|
| 0:07:47| I think if everything had to go through a committee, given how infrequently a committee is being linked, it would logjam most of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=467)|
| 0:07:54| And I'm not suggesting they're everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=474)|
| 0:07:56| It's just perhaps certain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=476)|
| 0:07:58| Everything doesn't have a committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=478)|
| 0:08:00| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=480)|
| 0:08:01| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=481)|
| 0:08:02| So do we want to expand the language a little bit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=482)|
| 0:08:05| Or by majority vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=485)|
| 0:08:07| I would be comfortable with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=487)|
| 0:08:08| I was going to make a motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=488)|
| 0:08:10| I'll make a motion to add the words or by majority vote to the end of section I committee referrals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=490)|
| 0:08:17| Please say it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=497)|
| 0:08:18| Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=498)|
| 0:08:20| Majority vote of commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=500)|
| 0:08:21| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=501)|
| 0:08:22| Of commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=502)|
| 0:08:23| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=503)|
| 0:08:24| I always assume that Jill will turn whatever we turn into something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=504)|
| 0:08:28| Proper magic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=508)|
| 0:08:29| Proper magic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=509)|
| 0:08:30| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=510)|
| 0:08:31| So that's my motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=511)|
| 0:08:32| Do you have a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=512)|
| 0:08:33| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=513)|
| 0:08:34| Great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=514)|
| 0:08:35| We have a proper motion on the floor by Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=515)|
| 0:08:37| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=517)|
| 0:08:38| Director Rett, do we have a call in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=518)|
| 0:08:40| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=520)|
| 0:08:41| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=521)|
| 0:08:42| Motion passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=522)|
| 0:08:43| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=523)|
| 0:08:44| Moving on to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=524)|
| 0:08:45| Just two rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=525)|
| 0:08:47| Just because we're in rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=527)|
| 0:08:49| You still have to open up for discussion after you do the motions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=529)|
| 0:08:52| Oh, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=532)|
| 0:08:53| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=533)|
| 0:08:54| Just in case somebody doesn't agree with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=534)|
| 0:08:56| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=536)|
| 0:08:57| I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=537)|
| 0:08:58| No problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=538)|
| 0:08:59| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=539)|
| 0:09:00| Number A, discussion and consideration of inclusion of Hugh Knox County evidence policy to rule B committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=540)|
| 0:09:06| So this is an ask of the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=546)|
| 0:09:09| We include it under committees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=549)|
| 0:09:11| We just include it under board of commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=551)|
| 0:09:14| We also include it under rule five committees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=554)|
| 0:09:18| So it would be under commissioners not serving family members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=558)|
| 0:09:21| It would be Hugh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=561)|
| 0:09:22| It would also say that boards and committees adhere to the Knox County Code of Ethics policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=562)|
| 0:09:29| Speed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=569)|
| 0:09:30| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=570)|
| 0:09:31| Speed or five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=571)|
| 0:09:33| Rule five committees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=573)|
| 0:09:36| Slow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=576)|
| 0:09:37| And so we would add a section.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=577)|
| 0:09:39| Slow page.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=579)|
| 0:09:40| Well, it's not on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=580)|
| 0:09:41| Oh, I see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=581)|
| 0:09:42| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=582)|
| 0:09:43| So you need to go to the table of contents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=583)|
| 0:09:44| Rule five committees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=584)|
| 0:09:46| Oh, goodness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=586)|
| 0:09:47| And then we would add a section.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=587)|
| 0:09:50| Hugh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=590)|
| 0:09:51| Add to team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=591)|
| 0:09:53| That would be very similar to what we added to the board of commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=593)|
| 0:09:58| Stating that boards and committees adhere to the Knox County Code of Ethics policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=598)|
| 0:10:04| I have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=604)|
| 0:10:05| If our boards and committees don't always have people that are employees of Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=605)|
| 0:10:13| can a volunteer in that board also be held under the ethics policy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=613)|
| 0:10:18| Yes, under the ethics policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=618)|
| 0:10:20| It applies to appointees or volunteer or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=620)|
| 0:10:27| If you're doing anything for county, you can fall under the ethics policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=627)|
| 0:10:31| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=631)|
| 0:10:32| And all this is doing, as I understand it from Jeremy, is just sticking that in there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=632)|
| 0:10:38| as a reminder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=638)|
| 0:10:39| It's the same thing that it applies to the president of the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=639)|
| 0:10:44| And basically, although I threw this in when we talked with Kim earlier, I think commissions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=644)|
| 0:10:50| have always been of a mind, and I think Kim may have a good idea here, put it down for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=650)|
| 0:10:56| him, but commissions always had a mind that its committees were bound by the rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=656)|
| 0:11:01| I mean, you've always done that, but it's nowhere near the time, so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=661)|
| 0:11:05| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=665)|
| 0:11:06| So we just want to point you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=666)|
| 0:11:08| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=668)|
| 0:11:12| Are we in session?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=672)|
| 0:11:14| Do I have a proper license?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=674)|
| 0:11:17| We have a commissioner today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=677)|
| 0:11:19| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=679)|
| 0:11:20| Let's go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=680)|
| 0:11:21| I'll make a motion to add a new section under Rule 5, Committees Section U.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=681)|
| 0:11:30| We have a motion by Jay, a second by Oster.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=690)|
| 0:11:35| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=695)|
| 0:11:37| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=697)|
| 0:11:40| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=700)|
| 0:11:41| It passes as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=701)|
| 0:11:44| Moving on to number 9.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=704)|
| 0:11:46| Any discussion and consideration of Rule 5, Committees Section K, Year 4?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=706)|
| 0:11:51| Any commissioner choosing not to participate in the application process in their district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=711)|
| 0:11:56| and not participate in revocation hearings?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=716)|
| 0:11:59| Commissioner Oster, you brought this forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=719)|
| 0:12:01| Would you like to tell us a little bit about what you're thinking?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=721)|
| 0:12:03| I did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=723)|
| 0:12:04| I think, I kind of feel like when you take the position as commissioner, part of your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=724)|
| 0:12:11| job is to be involved in the mirror board, so that is given the license and also being| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=731)|
| 0:12:17| responsible for the revocation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=737)|
| 0:12:19| If you're not going to be a part of giving the license, I'm not sure that you should| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=739)|
| 0:12:24| be part of the punishment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=744)|
| 0:12:26| And so, I really would like it to state that if you are not participating in either one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=746)|
| 0:12:36| you are not a part of the process from the get-go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=756)|
| 0:12:41| And that's not to disrespect anybody's religion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=761)|
| 0:12:44| I understand it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=764)|
| 0:12:46| I just think it is not good when a commissioner won't give a clear permit, but they have no| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=766)|
| 0:12:57| problem taking them away or giving revocation for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=777)|
| 0:13:01| So, that's kind of where I'm landing on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=781)|
| 0:13:06| I kind of concur.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=786)|
| 0:13:08| I feel like if you're not going to be a part of the clear permit application process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=788)|
| 0:13:14| that if there is a violation, I'm not sure that you should also be able to invoke a violation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=794)|
| 0:13:21| if you are not supportive of the clear permit to begin with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=801)|
| 0:13:24| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=804)|
| 0:13:26| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=806)|
| 0:13:27| Question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=807)|
| 0:13:28| So, is this just if it applies to your district, or is it a call?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=808)|
| 0:13:34| Because I feel like if someone has the option to not participate in either, we're really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=814)|
| 0:13:45| limiting the number of commissioners that are active voting members of the beer board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=825)|
| 0:13:52| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=832)|
| 0:13:54| I would be inclined to say you just do both.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=834)|
| 0:14:00| But, again, let's look to our call director on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=840)|
| 0:14:04| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=844)|
| 0:14:05| There's a little bit here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=845)|
| 0:14:07| Director Boone, what say you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=847)|
| 0:14:09| I think you can, let me come back in from an applicant saying he's got something and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=849)|
| 0:14:16| he or she is contesting it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=856)|
| 0:14:19| And I think this kind of goes to what Commissioner Oster was saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=859)|
| 0:14:25| That person refused to vote to get a permit, but they're very quick to vote to take it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=865)|
| 0:14:31| away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=871)|
| 0:14:32| And there's something that just doesn't strike me as kosher in that, so to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=872)|
| 0:14:38| You would still have, the only problem you would have, you've got a couple of people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=878)|
| 0:14:42| that, for religious grounds or whatever, don't believe in doing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=882)|
| 0:14:46| You've still got to have your forum to vote, but you also have to have a majority of these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=886)|
| 0:14:53| higher bodies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=893)|
| 0:14:55| So it might cause a problem down the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=895)|
| 0:14:58| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=898)|
| 0:14:59| But I understand what Commissioner Oster is saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=899)|
| 0:15:02| There's just kind of a sense of fairness in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=902)|
| 0:15:05| So you have to have a majority of the body, not of the body present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=905)|
| 0:15:09| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=909)|
| 0:15:10| So we would have to change the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=910)|
| 0:15:12| You could change the ordinance to say a majority of those present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=912)|
| 0:15:20| But even if all 11 are present, well...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=920)|
| 0:15:25| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=925)|
| 0:15:26| I'm struggling with this one because I, in one way, I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=926)|
| 0:15:32| I get why people decide not to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=932)|
| 0:15:35| But I also, like we, when you become a commissioner, you're bound by, you know, to uphold the Constitution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=935)|
| 0:15:44| of the United States.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=944)|
| 0:15:46| The state is to see in the Charter of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=946)|
| 0:15:48| If somebody presents something to us that is legal and within the laws that we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=948)|
| 0:15:53| set and that the state sets and that we have according to our ordinance, you don't really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=953)|
| 0:15:59| have grounds to deny somebody they followed the law and they go through the process, other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=959)|
| 0:16:05| than I don't like it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=965)|
| 0:16:06| I think that's a weird, slippery slope of, like, I just don't like this one, so I'm not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=966)|
| 0:16:10| going to participate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=970)|
| 0:16:11| But at any point, any commissioner could not show up, not say a word.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=971)|
| 0:16:16| There's no requirement for you to show up, for you to vote, to open your mouth, or do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=976)|
| 0:16:21| anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=981)|
| 0:16:22| Like, there's nothing in the code that says you have to actually participate in any law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=982)|
| 0:16:27| or any vote or anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=987)|
| 0:16:30| You could get elected and show up four years later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=990)|
| 0:16:32| I mean, quite frankly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=992)|
| 0:16:33| So I don't see the enforceable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=993)|
| 0:16:37| I wonder, would you then have to keep track of who participated?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=997)|
| 0:16:42| Let's say I'm Ken Joe and I come back in a violation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=1002)|
| 0:16:46| Is somebody going to be able to pull up, oh, by the way, only U6 were here and voted for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=1006)|
| 0:16:52| this, and U3 didn't participate, so the vote to rescind the thing is only going to be for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=1012)|
| 0:16:58| U6.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=1018)|
| 0:16:59| I don't know how muddy that gets in the logistics of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=1019)|
| 0:17:03| I mean, I would rather see something on the front end that just says, this is the beer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=1023)|
| 0:17:09| board ordinance, and you take yourself out of the beer board if you don't want to participate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=1029)|
| 0:17:16| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=1036)|
| 0:17:17| Before we get to the committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=1037)|
| 0:17:19| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=1039)|
| 0:17:20| I'm good with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=1040)|
| 0:17:21| But I don't know how to do that legally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=1041)|
| 0:17:23| I think it's so hard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=1043)|
| 0:17:24| You have to opt out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=1044)|
| 0:17:25| And then one of the commissioners says, sorry, I don't want to go for it, but I'm sure you're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=1045)|
| 0:17:29| going to serve up a penalty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=1049)|
| 0:17:32| And I don't recall, and you will, or Courtney might remember, too, when you've got somebody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=1052)|
| 0:17:39| that says they don't make the motion for 100% because I don't know where it comes from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=1059)|
| 0:17:44| And so somebody makes the motion for them, and then you vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=1064)|
| 0:17:48| Does that person traditionally not vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=1068)|
| 0:17:51| They don't?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=1071)|
| 0:17:52| I think they do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=1072)|
| 0:17:53| I don't think they do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=1073)|
| 0:17:55| Is it recorded as a net vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=1075)|
| 0:17:57| Or as a passed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=1077)|
| 0:18:00| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=1080)|
| 0:18:01| It's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=1081)|
| 0:18:02| Not unless they say that they passed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=1082)|
| 0:18:04| We just automatically do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=1084)|
| 0:18:09| I don't remember what they do traditionally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=1089)|
| 0:18:12| It's like what you said, Thursday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=1092)|
| 0:18:16| Usually they'll ask an outlawed commissioner to make the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=1096)|
| 0:18:20| But a pass is a vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=1100)|
| 0:18:22| A pass is a note.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=1102)|
| 0:18:24| It's a note, but it is an actual action being taken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=1104)|
| 0:18:29| It's all about the motion to approve is really what it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=1109)|
| 0:18:32| Because they could pass on everything, and that's actually a legislative action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=1112)|
| 0:18:36| It's all about who's making the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=1116)|
| 0:18:39| And honestly, I think we've talked about other committees and stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=1119)|
| 0:18:44| I think we give the district commissioner the courtesy, but it doesn't have to be them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=1124)|
| 0:18:53| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=1133)|
| 0:18:56| Even if you were in the room, I could be like, nope, I'm making the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=1136)|
| 0:18:59| Let's go for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=1139)|
| 0:19:00| Because you may not like that person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=1140)|
| 0:19:03| So this is a sticky one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=1143)|
| 0:19:08| Is this intended to apply only to that commissioner's district?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=1148)|
| 0:19:14| If they refuse to grant, and if they are pulled out of the withdrawal process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=1154)|
| 0:19:24| and they're pulled out of the granting process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=1164)|
| 0:19:26| or did you intend for the application part| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=1166)|
| 0:19:33| to be for every other district they cannot vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=1173)|
| 0:19:37| Or is this just in their own district that you're speaking?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=1177)|
| 0:19:41| I mean, typically, that's just what we're saying, is in their own district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=1181)|
| 0:19:45| And that's typically what Larson or Kim will take.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=1185)|
| 0:19:49| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=1189)|
| 0:19:50| So if they weren't excluded from others, only their own,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=1190)|
| 0:19:55| then that probably could fix the quorum or the majority problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=1195)|
| 0:20:03| But that also speaks to the point you all have just made,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=1203)|
| 0:20:06| that it doesn't go down in the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=1206)|
| 0:20:10| Even if they are not voting for other permit applications,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=1210)|
| 0:20:15| which they shouldn't be, if they have any sort of moral or ethical reason| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=1215)|
| 0:20:21| not to make a motion for an application,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=1221)|
| 0:20:25| then they surely are not voting on all the applications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=1225)|
| 0:20:29| Or are they?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=1229)|
| 0:20:30| And how does that go down in the record?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=1230)|
| 0:20:33| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=1233)|
| 0:20:34| Why don't we just address it on the front end of the establishment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=1234)|
| 0:20:37| of the beer board, and put something in there that says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=1237)|
| 0:20:41| members of the beer board shall participate in all parts of the beer board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=1241)|
| 0:20:48| or shall make appointments for their district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=1248)|
| 0:20:51| or recommendations in their district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=1251)|
| 0:20:53| and be part of revocation or penalty processes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=1253)|
| 0:20:56| If a commissioner chooses not to participate in it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=1256)|
| 0:20:59| then they can opt out of being part of the beer board by letter to the chair| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=1259)|
| 0:21:04| by the end of September 1st, or something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=1264)|
| 0:21:07| Give them the option of just saying, I don't want to participate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=1267)|
| 0:21:10| And if you are going to participate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=1270)|
| 0:21:13| it says you've got to vote one way or the other,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=1273)|
| 0:21:16| and you've got to make recommendations to the district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=1276)|
| 0:21:18| And if you don't, just opt out of the beer board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=1278)|
| 0:21:21| get your time back, and six or seven of us will show up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=1281)|
| 0:21:24| And then we can do it while we're making that change,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=1284)|
| 0:21:27| say the majority of members of the beer board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=1287)|
| 0:21:30| instead of the majority of members of the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=1290)|
| 0:21:32| It's just a board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=1292)|
| 0:21:34| It's just a committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=1294)|
| 0:21:36| It's a sustaining committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=1296)|
| 0:21:37| But it's not like an election decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=1297)|
| 0:21:40| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=1300)|
| 0:21:41| Yeah, it's full memberships.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=1301)|
| 0:21:42| Could we address it that way, and then just give somebody an option out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=1302)|
| 0:21:45| and then it doesn't get money on the back end of who votes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=1305)|
| 0:21:48| I'm completely fine with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=1308)|
| 0:21:50| Do you think that would be possible?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=1310)|
| 0:21:52| We would have to look at the ordinance as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=1312)|
| 0:21:54| I have this little worry there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=1314)|
| 0:21:59| Let me do a little more research on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=1319)|
| 0:22:02| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=1322)|
| 0:22:03| So what you're saying is they opt off the beer board altogether, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=1323)|
| 0:22:10| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=1330)|
| 0:22:11| Well, on the front end, we wanted to say that members shall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=1331)|
| 0:22:15| It does say the entire Knox County Commission shall regulate the sale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=1335)|
| 0:22:20| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=1340)|
| 0:22:21| It doesn't say shall participate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=1341)|
| 0:22:25| But it does say shall regulate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=1345)|
| 0:22:27| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=1347)|
| 0:22:28| It depends on how the ordinance is written.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=1348)|
| 0:22:30| Well, it's a Resolution 11 ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=1350)|
| 0:22:32| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=1352)|
| 0:22:33| But then you have to go to the members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=1353)|
| 0:22:38| I think that on the front end, being able to just essentially say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=1358)|
| 0:22:43| if you're going to serve on the beer board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=1363)|
| 0:22:45| you're going to participate in all portions of this beer board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=1365)|
| 0:22:48| which include making motions to approve or deny applications,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=1368)|
| 0:22:54| hearing revocation or suspension, and handing out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=1374)|
| 0:22:58| appropriate sentences according to the beer board license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=1378)|
| 0:23:01| If you choose not to participate in all parts of the beer board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=1381)|
| 0:23:05| on September 1st, because the chair is the first elected,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=1385)|
| 0:23:10| on September 1st, you can, by writing or by voice,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=1390)|
| 0:23:14| ask the chair to not be included on the beer board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=1394)|
| 0:23:18| And then the minority of the beer board will have issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=1398)|
| 0:23:20| And you just give people that option to opt out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=1400)|
| 0:23:22| And maybe it doesn't go into effect until next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=1402)|
| 0:23:24| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=1404)|
| 0:23:25| But it just gives them a, you know what,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=1405)|
| 0:23:27| if I'm not doing it all, I'm out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=1407)|
| 0:23:29| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=1409)|
| 0:23:30| And it says in there, you have to do it all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=1410)|
| 0:23:32| You shall, or whatever the reality is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=1412)|
| 0:23:35| I think that's a better way to, because otherwise,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=1415)|
| 0:23:37| these guys are going to go crazy trying to kick you out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=1417)|
| 0:23:40| Can I ask another question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=1420)|
| 0:23:42| This will be more, because I don't pay attention to the votes that much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=1422)|
| 0:23:47| I just make sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=1427)|
| 0:23:49| And usually it's pretty unanimous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=1429)|
| 0:23:52| Let's say that in the 8th district, no motion is made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=1432)|
| 0:23:56| Larson makes the motion to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=1436)|
| 0:24:01| Let's stick it out of the 8th district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=1441)|
| 0:24:03| Let's just say any other district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=1443)|
| 0:24:05| Do any of these commissioners that may have legitimate religious beliefs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=1445)|
| 0:24:10| vote on all the others?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=1450)|
| 0:24:12| Or do they abstain from voting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=1452)|
| 0:24:14| No, I think you're out of the beer board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=1454)|
| 0:24:16| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=1456)|
| 0:24:17| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=1457)|
| 0:24:18| Unless you agree to participate in all parts of the beer board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=1458)|
| 0:24:20| you're just not on the beer board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=1460)|
| 0:24:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=1461)|
| 0:24:22| And the beer board may be seven, or eight, or nine, or 10, 11.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=1462)|
| 0:24:25| I mean, it may be five members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=1465)|
| 0:24:27| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=1467)|
| 0:24:28| And then do you have to change the ordinance to majority of the body?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=1468)|
| 0:24:31| Yeah, the majority of the beer board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=1471)|
| 0:24:34| The majority of the beer board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=1474)|
| 0:24:35| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=1475)|
| 0:24:36| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=1476)|
| 0:24:37| No, it has to be a majority of the beer board membership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=1477)|
| 0:24:39| No, beer board membership, not just who showed up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=1479)|
| 0:24:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=1481)|
| 0:24:42| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=1482)|
| 0:24:43| Commissioner Hedger, will this be your agenda item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=1483)|
| 0:24:45| Are you comfortable with that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=1485)|
| 0:24:47| I am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=1487)|
| 0:24:48| I mean, you're going to do some research.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=1488)|
| 0:24:49| Yeah, I'll see what we can do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=1489)|
| 0:24:50| We've got the intertwining of the state law and our beer ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=1490)|
| 0:24:54| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=1494)|
| 0:24:55| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=1495)|
| 0:24:56| I'm comfortable with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=1496)|
| 0:24:57| I mean, I think we're moving in the right direction from the spirit of what I was trying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=1497)|
| 0:25:03| to discuss.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=1503)|
| 0:25:04| So why don't we decide to bring this back to the next Rules Committee, and we'll then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=1504)|
| 0:25:10| review the language and vote on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=1510)|
| 0:25:12| I don't have to make any more adjustments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=1512)|
| 0:25:14| Nope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=1514)|
| 0:25:15| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=1515)|
| 0:25:16| Fantastic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=1516)|
| 0:25:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=1517)|
| 0:25:18| And then the discussion items that I added, the first one was, this is just a simple word| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=1518)|
| 0:25:22| add, and Jill said we may not even need to do this, but I want to make you all aware,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=1522)|
| 0:25:28| because I'm very tickety-boo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=1528)|
| 0:25:30| Under Rule 5, where it says committees, I just want to add committees and boards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=1530)|
| 0:25:34| I don't even think we need a motion or anything, but just to bring to everyone's attention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=1534)|
| 0:25:40| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=1540)|
| 0:25:41| That's a housekeeping item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=1541)|
| 0:25:43| There you go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=1543)|
| 0:25:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=1544)|
| 0:25:45| The next discussion item is an attendance policy for our boards and committees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=1545)|
| 0:25:52| This is something that I think we need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=1552)|
| 0:25:57| Some of the boards and committees within our separate rules and bylaws do address attendance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=1557)|
| 0:26:04| However, if we want to create a standard attendance policy that can be adopted by all rules and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=1564)|
| 0:26:11| committees, I feel like that would be beneficial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=1571)|
| 0:26:16| Do you have an example of one of the boards that has an attendance policy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=1576)|
| 0:26:20| I know Three Bridges just incorporated one, which again, I can work on some language for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=1580)|
| 0:26:26| this committee and bring it to the next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=1586)|
| 0:26:28| What does the enforcement people know?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=1588)|
| 0:26:31| Just to say, do you know their appointment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=1591)|
| 0:26:33| If they're removed from the board, and then whether it's appointed by commission or appointed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=1593)|
| 0:26:37| by the mayor, then they have to make another appointment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=1597)|
| 0:26:40| We talked about there are different attendance policies out there that if you have two consecutive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=1600)|
| 0:26:48| excused absences or unexcused absences, then A, B, and C happens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=1608)|
| 0:26:54| It could be that you can petition and state your case to stay on to commission or the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=1614)|
| 0:27:01| mayor, or we may decide to write a policy that just says if you have two consecutive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=1621)|
| 0:27:08| unexcused absences, you were removed, and the commission or the mayor brings in points| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=1628)|
| 0:27:14| to fill the unfilled term of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=1634)|
| 0:27:17| This would apply to all of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=1637)|
| 0:27:19| All of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=1639)|

| 0:27:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=1649)|
| 0:27:32| So, what is excused?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=1652)|
| 0:27:36| Well, that's the rabbit hole I'm going to go down to work on, to bring back to this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=1656)|
| 0:27:42| committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=1662)|
| 0:27:43| The next one I'll have some language and some examples, and then we can kind of go from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=1663)|
| 0:27:47| there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=1667)|
| 0:27:48| I gave Commissioner Frazier an example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231025-rules-committee?start=1668)|
