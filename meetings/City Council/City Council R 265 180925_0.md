| 0:12:04| Neither of them were handcuffed or arrested| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180925?start=724)|
| 0:12:09| Now further investment into police and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180925?start=729)|
| 0:12:13| into police infrastructure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180925?start=733)|
| 0:12:15| Like the 40 million dollar| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180925?start=735)|
| 0:12:18| Headquarters you would like to build in this location| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180925?start=738)|
| 0:12:24| Further investment to this while the racist repressive and brutal police violence like this runs rampant in Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180925?start=744)|
| 0:12:31| That's a moral and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180925?start=751)|
| 0:12:34| It shows a disconnect between you all and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180925?start=754)|
| 0:12:38| black| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180925?start=758)|
| 0:12:39| working-class| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180925?start=759)|
| 0:12:40| Poor people like me who have to constantly worry about police violence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180925?start=760)|
| 0:12:49| Policing in Knoxville won't get better| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180925?start=769)|
| 0:12:52| Until the community has the power| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180925?start=772)|
| 0:12:54| To discipline and fire cops when they display oppressive behavior and to affect the policies that govern police| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180925?start=774)|
| 0:13:02| officers and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180925?start=782)|
| 0:13:04| to be able to affect the budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180925?start=784)|
| 0:13:06| And I mean the community having the power to do this directly not with the say-so of the mayor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180925?start=786)|
| 0:13:12| Not with the say-so of the police chief| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180925?start=792)|
| 0:13:16| Not how it is currently through the park system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180925?start=796)|
| 0:13:18| But actually directly be able to say this is what policing should look like and this is what policing shouldn't look like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180925?start=798)|
| 0:13:25| And be able to act on that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180925?start=805)|
| 0:13:31| Until we see changes like that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180925?start=811)|
| 0:13:33| We won't see changes in the violent police| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180925?start=813)|
| 0:13:36| Eve Thomas was there to the day that happened| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180925?start=816)|
| 0:13:39| Saw the whole incident go down and was still okay with it. Now. We can't change this culture unless the community has real power| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180925?start=819)|
| 0:13:46| And to my people's I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180925?start=826)|
| 0:13:50| Would say that we must organize ourselves our communities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180925?start=830)|
| 0:13:54| to provide for ourselves and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180925?start=834)|
| 0:13:58| To keep us safe, so we don't need cops| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180925?start=838)|
| 0:14:02| We must organize politically to obtain power to shift local government and to make sure our human rights are respected| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180925?start=842)|
| 0:14:12| That's all Thank You mr. Hayes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180925?start=852)|
| 0:14:18| Next speaker is Constance every| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180925?start=858)|
| 0:14:24| Thank you for being here, please state your name and address for the record| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180925?start=864)|
| 0:14:27| And if you would please watch the timer you have up to five minutes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180925?start=867)|
| 0:14:32| Hello, my name is Constance every my address is 301 Northshire Howie Drive, Knoxville, Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180925?start=872)|
| 0:14:40| 37914 I am the founder of the nonprofit organization sleeves for needs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180925?start=880)|
| 0:14:46| I come here today to speak particularly this matter in addressing for the community and how it is affecting the community with this decision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180925?start=886)|
| 0:14:53| I would like to begin that this same agenda| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180925?start=893)|
| 0:14:56| Came from Mechanicsville in KC Knoxville College. If I recall this was originally wanting to be placed there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180925?start=896)|
| 0:15:03| As it is seeing that that is probably not going to be something that's going to occur| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180925?start=903)|
| 0:15:06| I feel like this ridiculous agenda has now moved into the North Knoxville area right behind Fulton High School of our old hospital| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180925?start=906)|
| 0:15:14| Which is originally known as st. Mary's before it became to Nova| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180925?start=914)|
| 0:15:16| I think that this decision is selfish in its making| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180925?start=916)|
| 0:15:20| Because number one when you remove the hospital out of that community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180925?start=920)|
| 0:15:24| That's exactly was affected by that that community see now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180925?start=924)|
| 0:15:28| What you have done is that for those same people that are located right there in the Broadway?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180925?start=928)|
| 0:15:34| Fountain City a dare| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180925?start=934)|
| 0:15:36| what else is over there Christian Berry the back side of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180925?start=936)|
| 0:15:40| Central and as well as some of the parts of the Mechanicsville area is affected by this decision because when they call the ambulance for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180925?start=940)|
| 0:15:47| Service or need of assistance you better believe the ambulance is going to charge them for the 15-minute difference from st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180925?start=947)|
| 0:15:54| Mary's now down here to UT and Fort Sanders location| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180925?start=954)|
| 0:15:57| Yeah, you did put one in halls, but that's another 15 minutes that direction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180925?start=957)|
| 0:16:01| So the money is still going to cost that community if they are in need of immediate medical assistance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180925?start=961)|
| 0:16:07| I think that to say the necessity of another fire station| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180925?start=967)|
| 0:16:11| I find ridiculous as well because in the next block up right across the street from Bell elementary school sits an entire fire department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180925?start=971)|
| 0:16:18| It's right there for that community, and that's what I know of personally| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180925?start=978)|
| 0:16:21| I'm sure there are many more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180925?start=981)|
| 0:16:22| But I know for a fact right there in that community across the street from Bell elementary school sits a whole fire station| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180925?start=982)|
| 0:16:28| Come on. Y'all really y'all can't think of anything better to do with that property in that facility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180925?start=988)|
| 0:16:33| I mean like I said, it's a high school sitting right there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180925?start=993)|
| 0:16:35| We are much more than baseball football and basketball| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180925?start=995)|
| 0:16:39| So maybe we could get something like a liberal arts program started there or as I said before| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180925?start=999)|
| 0:16:43| Because it does have a high school and other educational facilities sitting close so close to it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180925?start=1003)|
| 0:16:47| Why not make it into a study hall facility give our children free tutoring?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180925?start=1007)|
| 0:16:51| Let's say that we do believe in your education of education and higher learning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180925?start=1011)|
| 0:16:55| So we're going to promote that by putting a facility in your community that will help you or I don't know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180925?start=1015)|
| 0:17:00| There's a lot of homeless people in that area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180925?start=1020)|
| 0:17:02| Maybe an actual drug detox not rehab detox program might be good for that location| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180925?start=1022)|
| 0:17:08| I feel like there's so many other things that we could do with 40 million dollars to put into a building that could service a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180925?start=1028)|
| 0:17:14| Community with much more than more policing which leads to more harassing it does it's real here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180925?start=1034)|
| 0:17:19| We have same racial issues and tensions in our communities with the police and black people just like anywhere else in America| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180925?start=1039)|
| 0:17:25| So let's not play like it's a secret or a game| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180925?start=1045)|
| 0:17:27| That we could find something much greater to do that would better our communities with it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180925?start=1047)|
| 0:17:32| I keep saying this is that what people understand is if you keep| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180925?start=1052)|
| 0:17:36| Oppressing and pushing on the poor and the less fortunate. It's only going to create more madness more chaos more aggression more tension| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180925?start=1056)|
| 0:17:44| But if you take some of your money actually invested in your communities to help better them and improve them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180925?start=1064)|
| 0:17:49| You might find shockingly the changes that you are going to be faced with when you have these same groups now coming less aggressive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180925?start=1069)|
| 0:17:55| Because they feel like they are more productive therefore they reach and aim higher| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180925?start=1075)|
| 0:17:59| That's my whole concept stop wasting money in this city on stuff that really is not helping anyone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180925?start=1079)|
| 0:18:05| But selected individuals y'all agendas are very personal. They're never about the community or all of us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180925?start=1085)|
| 0:18:10| It's always a select few that are going to profit from this you know who's going to help with this new building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180925?start=1090)|
| 0:18:15| The police that live in that area okay short commute for you guys the fire the people that live in that area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180925?start=1095)|
| 0:18:20| Sure commute for you guys| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180925?start=1100)|
| 0:18:21| But you know who suffers the children the sick the elderly the homeless| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180925?start=1101)|
| 0:18:25| Everybody else suffers for a building that benefits a select few y'all can't be serious about that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180925?start=1105)|
| 0:18:31| That's not even realistic in thought processing and the fact that my own mayor sits here is one of the main drivers behind that agenda| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180925?start=1111)|
| 0:18:37| Why what benefit are you bringing to the city of merit that you're supposed to be over?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180925?start=1117)|
| 0:18:42| Thank goodness for elections though right because we get to vote about that one too. That's all I gotta say about it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180925?start=1122)|
| 0:18:47| That's not the best agenda for that a building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180925?start=1127)|
| 0:18:49| I think we could do much more much greater| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180925?start=1129)|
| 0:18:51| But if y'all feel like 40 million dollars worth of cash spent on a select few people is the best ideal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180925?start=1131)|
| 0:18:57| More power to you. I see you at election time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180925?start=1137)|
| 0:19:02| You ma'am| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180925?start=1142)|
| 0:19:03| Okay, that is the end of the people who wish to speak councilwoman Singh Perez. Yeah, I had a couple questions about this item| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180925?start=1143)|
| 0:19:12| One should I speak with you mr.. Brace| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180925?start=1152)|
| 0:19:15| One if you could address the issue about to Nova Hospital and what's going on with that site with yeah| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180925?start=1155)|
| 0:19:20| I think to Nova had reached out to the city. They've made a decision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180925?start=1160)|
| 0:19:24| That the facility will not and isn't efficient for the delivery of the health care| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180925?start=1164)|
| 0:19:29| They want to provide and so they've announced that they've been public so the city doesn't own the property to Nova does and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180925?start=1169)|
| 0:19:35| They've made a decision about where they want to invest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180925?start=1175)|
| 0:19:38| Their resources to provide services in our community, and they've talked about that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180925?start=1178)|
| 0:19:42| North and Turkey Creek and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180925?start=1182)|
| 0:19:45| off of Middlebrook| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180925?start=1185)|
| 0:19:46| And so they posed an opportunity to the city about a potential use for KPD KFD and city courts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180925?start=1186)|
| 0:19:56| Just to reiterate that we have not asked them to move the hospital| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180925?start=1196)|
| 0:20:00| We have nothing to do with their business decision to close the hospital we now there will be an empty facility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180925?start=1200)|
| 0:20:08| They've made it clear to us that there will be an empty campus in short order and now they are looking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180925?start=1208)|
| 0:20:14| For a way to not have an empty building. They're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180925?start=1214)|
| 0:20:19| affecting the school the neighborhood the businesses in the area and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180925?start=1219)|
| 0:20:24| Now that we have a need to build a new KPD and KFD not a fire station| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180925?start=1224)|
| 0:20:30| We are not building a fire station| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180925?start=1230)|
| 0:20:31| We were building administrative offices for the fire department, which as you all know are now at least in a separate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180925?start=1231)|
| 0:20:39| building originally KPD and KFD were together in the public what is the public safety building as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180925?start=1239)|
| 0:20:45| They outgrew that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180925?start=1245)|
| 0:20:47| KFD moved out so now there's a need to build a facility both the administrative offices of KFD| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180925?start=1247)|
| 0:20:55| The and the police department a portion of the police department because many of them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180925?start=1255)|
| 0:20:59| You know, they're they don't sit in an office all day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180925?start=1259)|
| 0:21:02| But for those who do need offices that will go into what otherwise will become a vacant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180925?start=1262)|
| 0:21:08| Campus and have a hugely negative impact on the neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180925?start=1268)|
| 0:21:12| Some of the other questions I had about this is before we approve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180925?start=1272)|
| 0:21:16| $50,000 to look at this site as a potential site for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180925?start=1276)|
| 0:21:21| the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180925?start=1281)|
| 0:21:22| Offices are there other sites that we're looking at as well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180925?start=1282)|
| 0:21:27| Let's start with that, okay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180925?start=1287)|
| 0:21:28| well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180925?start=1288)|
| 0:21:28| the mayor has made it very clear that if we're going to invest 40 million dollars for KPD and KFD that we would do that in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180925?start=1288)|
| 0:21:35| a location that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180925?start=1295)|
| 0:21:36| Benefits both KPD KFD and city court, but also the community where it is at and so the sites we've looked at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180925?start=1296)|
| 0:21:43| this was actually a site that was looked at prior to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180925?start=1303)|
| 0:21:46| My role as COO a couple of years ago this popped up. It was a primary location. It's a great opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180925?start=1306)|
| 0:21:52| It then to Nova backed away at that time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180925?start=1312)|
| 0:21:55| They were making some evaluations of the property and Knoxville College approached the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180925?start=1315)|
| 0:21:59| So that seemed to again fit that location where it would impact not only KPD KFD, but the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180925?start=1319)|
| 0:22:06| So we looked at Knoxville College right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180925?start=1326)|
| 0:22:08| We have an opportunity that we think is an incredible opportunity at to know as the mayor said this would be an empty medical facility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180925?start=1328)|
| 0:22:14| It's a large campus could become a blighting factor on the neighborhood. And so we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180925?start=1334)|
| 0:22:19| The contract resolution you have tonight is to is up to 50,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180925?start=1339)|
| 0:22:24| It's an hourly rate for Benefield Richter's to help us assess at the very preliminary level the programming that we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180925?start=1344)|
| 0:22:31| The uses do they fit and what the cost would be so it's a very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180925?start=1351)|
| 0:22:35| Preliminary look at that that opportunity and we think it's a great opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180925?start=1355)|
| 0:22:39| Well, I've been in support of not making a new building since the beginning and reusing things that we already have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180925?start=1359)|
| 0:22:46| But I saw in the package that 40 million dollars is still being considered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180925?start=1366)|
| 0:22:52| Is this a building that we're talking about tearing down and rebuilding or renovating to suit our needs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180925?start=1372)|
| 0:22:58| Well, we would be looking at renovating existing office facilities. So the campus is large| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180925?start=1378)|
| 0:23:03| I think there was a map and overhead aerial that was included in your packets. It's a large campus| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180925?start=1383)|
| 0:23:08| We're looking at the the newer office buildings that are facing south| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180925?start=1388)|
| 0:23:14| Those newer office buildings that are 30 ish years old 25 to 30 35 years old are the buildings that we're looking at for renovation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180925?start=1394)|
| 0:23:22| But we're also asking mr. Richter's to look at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180925?start=1402)|
| 0:23:25| The other portion of the campus from a redevelopment perspective| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180925?start=1405)|
| 0:23:30| Okay, so it doesn't sound like 40 million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180925?start=1410)|
| 0:23:33| for a renovation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180925?start=1413)|
| 0:23:35| yes, I believe it will be at 40 million dollars for renovation the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180925?start=1415)|
| 0:23:40| the campus would need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180925?start=1420)|
| 0:23:43| Significant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180925?start=1423)|
| 0:23:44| Utility upgrades. So right now there's a steam plant that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180925?start=1424)|
| 0:23:48| Provides heat to many of those buildings on the campus. So we would have to do significant demolition. We would have to establish| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180925?start=1428)|
| 0:23:55| Utility service individually to each of those office buildings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180925?start=1435)|
| 0:23:58| We would then have to do interior demolition and then fully renovate the property for KPD and KFD's needs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180925?start=1438)|
| 0:24:05| And so yes, we anticipate and that's one thing. Mr. Richter's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180925?start=1445)|
| 0:24:10| Benefield Richter's is working on is what are those costs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180925?start=1450)|
| 0:24:14| What are the square footage needs do those needs and uses apply to those buildings is the application good if it is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180925?start=1454)|
| 0:24:20| What are the costs and then there's an analysis of the rest of the campus? We don't need the entire campus| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180925?start=1460)|
| 0:24:25| What are the costs associated with that demolition what buildings need to be potentially saved etc. I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180925?start=1465)|
| 0:24:31| I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180925?start=1471)|
| 0:24:33| Guess I'm hoping that there's another site that's being looked at that will not cost 40 million dollars to renovate and to reuse| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180925?start=1473)|
| 0:24:42| That's all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180925?start=1482)|
| 0:24:44| Councilwoman Ryder| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180925?start=1484)|
| 0:24:46| Yeah| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180925?start=1486)|
| 0:24:48| Okay, so I live walking distance from that location| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180925?start=1488)|
| 0:24:53| Part of the reason that we live walking distance from that location. One of the reasons is because when we moved here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180925?start=1493)|
| 0:25:00| From out-of-state my husband worked there and I'll tread lightly and not be a total open book here. I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180925?start=1500)|
| 0:25:09| Have issue with a false narrative that's painted that that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180925?start=1509)|
| 0:25:14| Anything anyone here in this room is doing to make that hospital leave. I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180925?start=1514)|
| 0:25:19| partnered with and worked with people from Kikma from West Knoxville from North Knoxville, etc| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180925?start=1519)|
| 0:25:25| To come to council meetings and speak against that hospital moving later on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180925?start=1525)|
| 0:25:31| That is not good for my community to have a large institutional vacant building the decisions that have led to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180925?start=1531)|
| 0:25:39| prior to this moment in time that large entity moving| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180925?start=1539)|
| 0:25:44| Have been laid in place for years years and years CEOs for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180925?start=1544)|
| 0:25:51| Non-profit entities that don't even exist anymore that controlled that hospital made management decisions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180925?start=1551)|
| 0:25:57| That led to where we are today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180925?start=1557)|
| 0:26:00| They bought Baptist they bought all their debt| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180925?start=1560)|
| 0:26:02| And then they left us with Baptist as a large blighted hospital on the river in South Knoxville. That was a long time burden| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180925?start=1562)|
| 0:26:10| to the city where the city partnered up and helped| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180925?start=1570)|
| 0:26:14| Right that ship and get something else going there besides a vacant large property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180925?start=1574)|
| 0:26:20| I've worked in a lot of hospitals actually myself and they are large very special-use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180925?start=1580)|
| 0:26:25| Facilities and not anything can go into them and that's part of the problem when you leave something like that vacant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180925?start=1585)|
| 0:26:32| As a neighbor who lives walking distance from there. This is something the community is grossly concerned about the community has long been concerned about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180925?start=1592)|
| 0:26:41| Not having access to care, but the powers that be that were in charge of that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180925?start=1601)|
| 0:26:46| Institution prior to the folks that are in charge of it now, which by the way don't live most of those folks don't live in Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180925?start=1606)|
| 0:26:53| They made decisions that paved the way to where we are now. They put a hospital| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180925?start=1613)|
| 0:26:58| They built a brand new hospital in North Knoxville, and they made plans and they bought Baptist so they can get a hospital in West| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180925?start=1618)|
| 0:27:04| Knoxville, they made plans to put a hospital in on Middlebrook| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180925?start=1624)|
| 0:27:09| None of the North Knox community wanted to see that happen and we have no control over that and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180925?start=1629)|
| 0:27:16| Some of those decisions are what led my husband's group to leave that hospital and go elsewhere| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180925?start=1636)|
| 0:27:22| Where they provide care at another local hospital, so we are now faced with the situation in our community of losing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180925?start=1642)|
| 0:27:30| urgent care an ER| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180925?start=1650)|
| 0:27:33| But we are also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180925?start=1653)|
| 0:27:34| Faced with having a large| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180925?start=1654)|
| 0:27:36| Institutional empty vacant building with plumbing to all the small tiny rooms that are the hospital a large steam plant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180925?start=1656)|
| 0:27:44| Things that have been built all the way back to the 1920s includes asbestos| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180925?start=1664)|
| 0:27:49| Gas and oxygen piping to every room. It's a large| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180925?start=1669)|
| 0:27:54| expensive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180925?start=1674)|
| 0:27:55| remediation project and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180925?start=1675)|
| 0:27:57| I'm concerned about our community and what I do know is that that property has been shopped around for four years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180925?start=1677)|
| 0:28:05| People who have left that institution and don't work there anymore. We're showing that hospital to people and they haven't found anybody to buy it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180925?start=1685)|
| 0:28:12| Rumors with no basis are that the VA is going to move there and I've heard nothing to support that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180925?start=1692)|
| 0:28:19| So is someone who moved there because it was there and is now faced with having a large vacant lighted property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180925?start=1699)|
| 0:28:26| I want to see a good use for it and I could sit here and say I hope this will come and I hope that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180925?start=1706)|
| 0:28:32| Will come but to Nova has approached the city and we have a real need and I want to hear about where we are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180925?start=1712)|
| 0:28:39| And what the reality of it is going there and what if anything to Nova might keep there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180925?start=1719)|
| 0:28:45| But unfortunately what I have found| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180925?start=1725)|
| 0:28:47| Is that we have no control over to Nova they've made their decisions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180925?start=1727)|
| 0:28:51| Some of them are made outside of the state not in our local community and we don't have power over them. So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180925?start=1731)|
| 0:28:57| Mr. Brace, I would like to know in your conversations two things in your conversations with to Nova| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180925?start=1737)|
| 0:29:04| do they have any intentions of keeping any health care there and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180925?start=1744)|
| 0:29:09| Also part of this expenditure we're being asked about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180925?start=1749)|
| 0:29:13| Will it be if this site doesn't work out? Will it parlay and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180925?start=1753)|
| 0:29:20| You know, are we spending all this money just to look at this site?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180925?start=1760)|
| 0:29:23| Are we spending some of this money to look at our needs so we can look at other sites?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180925?start=1763)|
| 0:29:27| And then I may say something else after that. Okay. Thank you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180925?start=1767)|
| 0:29:31| So, let me answer the second question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180925?start=1771)|
| 0:29:34| So part of the scope of work for Benefield Richter's is to review and walk through the existing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180925?start=1774)|
| 0:29:40| Facilities that both KPD KFD and City Court have to do a how many facilities do we have how much square feet and where all are?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180925?start=1780)|
| 0:29:47| they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180925?start=1787)|
| 0:29:48| right, so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180925?start=1788)|
| 0:29:50| What was that right that's what they're looking for. Yeah, they're evaluating that so part of it is a program review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180925?start=1790)|
| 0:29:55| What are the uses total square footage? Well, what is that the existing safety building? What is that Fifth Avenue?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180925?start=1795)|
| 0:30:01| What is that our lease space for KFD our lease space for Little Springs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180925?start=1801)|
| 0:30:05| We also have lease space for storage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180925?start=1805)|
| 0:30:06| So part of Benefield Richter's work is to pull all of that together and then look at those uses square footage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180925?start=1806)|
| 0:30:14| discuss future needs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180925?start=1814)|
| 0:30:15| Training needs and then take that over to the Tenova site and determine if it if it works| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180925?start=1815)|
| 0:30:21| Does it apply to those existing facilities? So that's task one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180925?start=1821)|
| 0:30:26| Benefit Richter's is also then going to look at what would it cost should it be able to fit there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180925?start=1826)|
| 0:30:31| What would the cost be and to give us some very preliminary cost estimates?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180925?start=1831)|
| 0:30:34| I'm gonna let Bill talk about the redevelopment question you posed on the front end and about Tenova, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180925?start=1834)|
| 0:30:40| Thank you very much David and this will address| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180925?start=1840)|
| 0:30:43| Councilman Singh Perez's concerns a little bit to the first two sites. We did look at were done. So purposefully| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180925?start=1843)|
| 0:30:50| Because we wanted to do more than just locate the KPD KFD court| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180925?start=1850)|
| 0:30:54| We also wanted to do it in such a way that benefited nearby neighborhoods and dealt with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180925?start=1854)|
| 0:31:00| threatening blighting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180925?start=1860)|
| 0:31:01| situation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180925?start=1861)|
| 0:31:01| so we were approached first by Knoxville College who as you know the back part of their campus as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180925?start=1861)|
| 0:31:05| Significant challenges with the status of the buildings and then with Tenova who are abandoning the entire site| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180925?start=1865)|
| 0:31:12| They're not planning on leaving any health care| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180925?start=1872)|
| 0:31:14| There our concern here is that basically the front part of the structure can well serve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180925?start=1874)|
| 0:31:21| KBT KFD and courts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180925?start=1881)|
| 0:31:23| But once you get back of the emerald back in back of the tower and to the old original site| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180925?start=1883)|
| 0:31:28| There was a lot there that's very blighted the original| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180925?start=1888)|
| 0:31:32| We figured the original hospital building can can be reused in a great way that would benefit the neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180925?start=1892)|
| 0:31:38| but wings all the rest of the wings and other things around there are sick as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180925?start=1898)|
| 0:31:43| Councilman Ryder pointed out have real significant asbestos and other problems that mean their demolition is necessary and also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180925?start=1903)|
| 0:31:50| expensive our concern is very much not only with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180925?start=1910)|
| 0:31:55| Location of the facility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180925?start=1915)|
| 0:31:57| but its impact on the neighborhood and we see that back half dealing with the back half of the hospital segwaying and oakwood league and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180925?start=1917)|
| 0:32:03| Park has given us a tremendous opportunity to make use of that the old historic hospital building and then to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180925?start=1923)|
| 0:32:10| And to have that work seamlessly into the neighborhood in a positive way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180925?start=1930)|
| 0:32:15| so that that entire campus provides opportunity one for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180925?start=1935)|
| 0:32:20| Sighting of KFD and KPD and to to make sure the neighborhood is as you noted very well is not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180925?start=1940)|
| 0:32:26| harmed by having any abandoned and blighted structures there quite to the contrary making some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180925?start=1946)|
| 0:32:31| Lemons into lemonade in terms of what that can be in as we approach the north end| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180925?start=1951)|
| 0:32:39| Thank You councilman Wallace, thank you, mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180925?start=1959)|
| 0:32:42| Brace are we under under any formal agreement with to Nova or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180925?start=1962)|
| 0:32:47| Representatives for that property not yet. We so to Nova has a realty trust group that is representing them, but they're at the table| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180925?start=1967)|
| 0:32:55| And we're actively discussing and and evaluating the property. So we've had good dialogue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180925?start=1975)|
| 0:33:01| but until we get this information back from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180925?start=1981)|
| 0:33:04| Benefield Richter's that dialogue is you know up at the 30,000 foot level| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180925?start=1984)|
| 0:33:08| So we believe that in the next 30 days. We will have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180925?start=1988)|
| 0:33:13| Good information to report back and to start again if it's positive to report back and to start| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180925?start=1993)|
| 0:33:20| start formalizing those negotiations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180925?start=2000)|
| 0:33:24| And so you hope to get back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180925?start=2004)|
| 0:33:26| Just a narrative I guess is what you're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180925?start=2006)|
| 0:33:29| Of an evaluation that they have no no drawings and but but mainly just a narrative on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180925?start=2009)|
| 0:33:36| Evaluation of the current facility and and then that facility and how it might fit in and how it might be used| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180925?start=2016)|
| 0:33:43| So I need X number square footage over here and we can get that in this space over there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180925?start=2023)|
| 0:33:49| That's mean you're it's it's big. It's big big picture. It's not not down in the details| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180925?start=2029)|
| 0:33:55| I don't present. No, we will hire. We're in the process of hiring a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180925?start=2035)|
| 0:33:59| An owner's representative who will then work with our purchasing department to secure an architect and other design| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180925?start=2039)|
| 0:34:05| Professionals to work with the fire department the police department to actually do the design work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180925?start=2045)|
| 0:34:10| So Benefield Richter's is not designing the new facility. They're doing very bare-bones| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180925?start=2050)|
| 0:34:16| you need a hundred and sixty thousand square feet this type of use an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180925?start=2056)|
| 0:34:21| Estimate for interior demolition an estimate for build-out an estimate for establishing utility establishment on those buildings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180925?start=2061)|
| 0:34:29| demolition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180925?start=2069)|
| 0:34:30| So we can separate out part of the older building from the newer buildings and then we've got to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180925?start=2070)|
| 0:34:35| Then they'll also look at the redevelopment cost. So what are the abatement and demolition numbers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180925?start=2075)|
| 0:34:41| For that back part of the campus the campus that that we anticipate could be a good redevelopment activity for the neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180925?start=2081)|
| 0:34:48| So we hope to have those numbers in the next 30 days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180925?start=2088)|
| 0:34:51| And again, these are these are these are early numbers, but we need to know are we in budget?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180925?start=2091)|
| 0:34:57| We would love to spend less than 40 million dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180925?start=2097)|
| 0:34:59| I can tell you right now if we could spend less than 40 if we could do 20 and get what they need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180925?start=2099)|
| 0:35:04| Absolutely, but there are significant costs that come with building a large facility or building out a large facility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180925?start=2104)|
| 0:35:10| So I think hopefully I'd answer your question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180925?start=2110)|
| 0:35:13| Right, so site, you know site analysis and building analysis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180925?start=2113)|
| 0:35:16| But big general numbers numbers that are based on tenant improvements and other buildings demolition and other buildings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180925?start=2116)|
| 0:35:22| they may have not necessarily this building, but just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180925?start=2122)|
| 0:35:26| Helping us build a very broad| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180925?start=2126)|
| 0:35:28| Budget and determination whether it's even feasible or not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180925?start=2128)|
| 0:35:31| I mean, you don't even know whether it's feasible based on what you know at this point if I might add something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180925?start=2131)|
| 0:35:35| Really we this is the second of what will be a number of steps committing the fewest resources| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180925?start=2135)|
| 0:35:40| Possible to get the information we need say at first| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180925?start=2140)|
| 0:35:43| We've gone through a number of walkthroughs and with the leadership of the police and fire departments to see is this something they see would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180925?start=2143)|
| 0:35:51| workable for them and get a general sense of whether the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180925?start=2151)|
| 0:35:56| Square footage is even in the ballpark. We pass that that hurdle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180925?start=2156)|
| 0:36:00| This is for the minute before we commit and a large amounts of money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180925?start=2160)|
| 0:36:04| Obviously we want to spend a little more on the front end to get another step of feasibility and at that point then the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180925?start=2164)|
| 0:36:11| Large, you know once we're sure we would go in and commit the larger| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180925?start=2171)|
| 0:36:15| Funds that would lead to the detail to which you referred a moment. It's really trying to prevent us from spending| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180925?start=2175)|
| 0:36:22| spending| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180925?start=2182)|
| 0:36:23| Good money after something bad| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180925?start=2183)|
| 0:36:24| I mean| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180925?start=2184)|
| 0:36:25| we're trying to protect that spend a little bit at a time and know what our costs are going to be and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180925?start=2185)|
| 0:36:29| Build this budget and build it and then then make a decision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180925?start=2189)|
| 0:36:32| So right it may be at this step if we find out it's not workable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180925?start=2192)|
| 0:36:35| Then we could look toward another site and try to use the same criteria| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180925?start=2195)|
| 0:36:39| But this is this is we think a very prudent way to approach it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180925?start=2199)|
| 0:36:42| Yeah, a big part of this too is taking to Nova has a decade's worth of facility reports and assessments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180925?start=2202)|
| 0:36:48| We've done preliminary programming with KPD KFD| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180925?start=2208)|
| 0:36:51| So it's really you know taking over the next you know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180925?start=2211)|
| 0:36:55| 90 days that contract could is up to 90 days is taking all of that information and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180925?start=2215)|
| 0:36:59| Distilling it down to a recommendation that we can use with the mayor City Council in the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180925?start=2219)|
| 0:37:05| Do you want to add that it would be the simplest thing for us to do and perhaps?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180925?start=2225)|
| 0:37:10| Less expensive in the short run would be to find a greenfield site| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180925?start=2230)|
| 0:37:15| Do some grading build something new we might come in with less money, but then in the end if we know that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180925?start=2235)|
| 0:37:22| We're going to have a vacant campus that could be very destructive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180925?start=2242)|
| 0:37:27| To the neighborhood just as Knoxville College| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180925?start=2247)|
| 0:37:30| Acknowledged and said their back of their campus the blight that they have there and how it impacts the neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180925?start=2250)|
| 0:37:36| You know we we could make that easy short-term decision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180925?start=2256)|
| 0:37:40| But in the end| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180925?start=2260)|
| 0:37:41| the mayor after me and the council after some of us would have to come back and figure out how to do the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180925?start=2261)|
| 0:37:47| redevelopment and the reinvestment to address| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180925?start=2267)|
| 0:37:51| Tenova in this case we have spent we spend a lot of money in this and from our budget on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180925?start=2271)|
| 0:37:57| Redevelopment on going in where there's blight where there's vacancy where there's calls for service, or there's police fire| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180925?start=2277)|
| 0:38:03| Things are happening in negatively impacting neighborhoods. That's why we're investing in Walter P. Taylor homes with KCDC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180925?start=2283)|
| 0:38:09| That's why we've done projects throughout the core of our city to address blight and to and to create investment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180925?start=2289)|
| 0:38:17| Reinvestment where there's been disinvestment or where their disinvestment is happening, and that's why we're taking the perhaps harder step| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180925?start=2297)|
| 0:38:25| We started first with Knoxville College because they came to us and said hey| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180925?start=2305)|
| 0:38:29| We're trying to work ourself out of the hole that we're in help us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180925?start=2309)|
| 0:38:32| You know and and help us with this back piece of our property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180925?start=2312)|
| 0:38:35| That's why we took a step that was more controversial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180925?start=2315)|
| 0:38:39| That was more difficult because we thought there would be value to the institution and to the neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180925?start=2319)|
| 0:38:45| We know that didn't work out because of their situation with their with the their lien holder| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180925?start=2325)|
| 0:38:52| But now we have another opportunity to work with the neighborhood that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180925?start=2332)|
| 0:38:57| Will be experiencing major disinvestment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180925?start=2337)|
| 0:39:01| It's already starting you know as as councilman Ryder said doctors are moving out services are moving out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180925?start=2341)|
| 0:39:07| So I'd rather spend more money on the front end on this project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180925?start=2347)|
| 0:39:11| To stabilize what will be otherwise an unstable place environment campus and know that we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180925?start=2351)|
| 0:39:19| Meeting our needs and also supporting the needs of the community the businesses the individuals that live and work there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180925?start=2359)|
| 0:39:26| And by the way support can imagine having that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180925?start=2366)|
| 0:39:30| Fulton High School with a totally vacant blighted campus. That's a difficult for somebody for a private| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180925?start=2370)|
| 0:39:38| Sector just to come in and spend the money on so we feel like this is gives us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180925?start=2378)|
| 0:39:45| It's it's sort of a two-for-one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180925?start=2385)|
| 0:39:47| You know we are getting we will get we think if Benefield Richter's and the the due diligence we do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180925?start=2387)|
| 0:39:54| If it proves to be right, and we will get a top-notch facility for our police and fire that will be there for the next| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180925?start=2394)|
| 0:40:01| 50 or so years about every 50 years we we have to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180925?start=2401)|
| 0:40:05| Redo this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180925?start=2405)|
| 0:40:07| And then we'll also be a stabilizing and not just stabilizing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180925?start=2407)|
| 0:40:12| But hopefully be a catalyst for for that neighborhood as well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180925?start=2412)|
| 0:40:16| So it's well worth the money that we may need to spend in our opinion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180925?start=2416)|
| 0:40:20| Okay, any other questions. Do you have more? Yeah, I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180925?start=2420)|
| 0:40:24| Respect the idea of the redevelopment and avoiding the blight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180925?start=2424)|
| 0:40:28| my concern is just that I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180925?start=2428)|
| 0:40:31| Feel like we have a blank we're looking at this like a blank check for 40 million dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180925?start=2431)|
| 0:40:35| And I don't want to do that. I appreciate your comment that you made that if it costs 20 even better| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180925?start=2435)|
| 0:40:42| But I just want us to be aware that because we talked about 40 million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180925?start=2442)|
| 0:40:46| That's a lot of money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180925?start=2446)|
| 0:40:48| And I don't want to go that high if we don't have to and I would like to stop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180925?start=2448)|
| 0:40:54| Us thinking that that's what we have because we don't it's a we would borrow it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180925?start=2454)|
| 0:41:00| Yes councilman Singh Perez. I do want you to know that 40 million was not a number we picked out of thin air. So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180925?start=2460)|
| 0:41:07| KPD were really KPD at the time and KFD. We took those square footage needs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180925?start=2467)|
| 0:41:11| We did some ballpark square foot estimates to come up with that 40 million and looked at some other comparable facilities. We also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180925?start=2471)|
| 0:41:19| We also have the city Public Service Department Public Works project that just wrapped up. That was a multi-year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180925?start=2479)|
| 0:41:26| Project so we had those numbers to work from so the 40 million was was was a number that is based on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180925?start=2486)|
| 0:41:34| Their needs and our experiences with construction now look construction costs have gone up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180925?start=2494)|
| 0:41:40| So part of getting Benefield Richter's in here is to bring it to the the present-day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180925?start=2500)|
| 0:41:45| Cost that we would expect for construction right now, and that's part of their work as well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180925?start=2505)|
| 0:41:49| But that 40 million was based on their needs and some estimates on square footage costs for for new construction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180925?start=2509)|
| 0:41:56| But rest assured we don't want to spend any more money than we have to we have a long list of redevelopment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180925?start=2516)|
| 0:42:02| Opportunities in our city, so we're not going to spend any morning any more money than we feel we need to on it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180925?start=2522)|
| 0:42:08| Okay, councilwoman Welch just just another note on that speaking about the construction costs. I think that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180925?start=2528)|
| 0:42:16| Sometimes it's hard to understand the complexity of the facility needs of both KK PD and KFD| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180925?start=2536)|
| 0:42:23| When I toured their facilities, I mean the types of evidence storage, that's necessary in order for people to receive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180925?start=2543)|
| 0:42:31| Justice through our court system all of that has to be accommodated through both both organizations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180925?start=2551)|
| 0:42:37| We have a whole you know how old is the facility again mayor. It's over 50 years old| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180925?start=2557)|
| 0:42:44| Okay, so I mean thinking about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180925?start=2564)|
| 0:42:47| the cyber you know cyber crime and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180925?start=2567)|
| 0:42:52| You know there's there's all sorts of new technology that and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180925?start=2572)|
| 0:42:56| Construction needs that need to be accommodated with this facility, so it is a lot of money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180925?start=2576)|
| 0:43:00| I'm totally on board. Let's keep it as low as possible, but also I think you know we think about construction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180925?start=2580)|
| 0:43:07| We might be thinking about like how much does it cost to build?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180925?start=2587)|
| 0:43:11| Another type of facility this is a very specialized facility. That's important to our community for us to be able to serve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180925?start=2591)|
| 0:43:18| Justice to make sure that we're safe that our community is healthy, and it's just a different type of specialized need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180925?start=2598)|
| 0:43:25| So we need to keep that in mind as well. Thank you councilman councilman McKenzie. Thank you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180925?start=2605)|
| 0:43:30| I just want us all to keep in mind as we are going through this process of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180925?start=2610)|
| 0:43:35| We all know that we have a need and it's a necessity to have a new| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180925?start=2615)|
