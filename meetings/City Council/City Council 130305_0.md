| 0:17:29| Oh, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=1049)|
| 0:17:30| Council Member Grieve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=1050)|
| 0:17:31| That's okay, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=1051)|
| 0:17:32| I just wanted to say that this is just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=1052)|
| 0:17:34| in the very beginning stages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=1054)|
| 0:17:36| The neighborhood has asked that it be looked into.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=1056)|
| 0:17:38| They still realize that they have a long way to go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=1058)|
| 0:17:40| in terms of getting all the neighborhood on board on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=1060)|
| 0:17:44| So, again, what it is, it's a request to ask MPC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=1064)|
| 0:17:48| to begin the process to look into this for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=1068)|
| 0:17:51| So, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=1071)|
| 0:17:51| Go ahead, sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=1071)|
| 0:17:52| So, as a request to ask the MPC to look into this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=1072)|
| 0:17:57| this is just on, I guess, on review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=1077)|
| 0:18:00| is what you're saying then now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=1080)|
| 0:18:03| Yeah, we're not passing this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=1083)|
| 0:18:06| to have you change your zoning at this particular time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=1086)|
| 0:18:10| What's happening is MPC is looking into it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=1090)|
| 0:18:13| and then there's a whole process that you go through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=1093)|
| 0:18:15| in terms of the neighborhood and neighborhood meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=1095)|
| 0:18:18| and people signing on and listening to those people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=1098)|
| 0:18:20| in favor of it and listening to those people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=1100)|
| 0:18:22| that are not in favor of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=1102)|
| 0:18:23| So, this is just the very beginning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=1103)|
| 0:18:25| It's like someone outside said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=1105)|
| 0:18:26| this is baby step number one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=1106)|
| 0:18:28| I see, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=1108)|
| 0:18:29| Well, then I'll remove my questions then for now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=1109)|
| 0:18:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=1113)|

| 0:19:01| Is that an old line?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=1141)|
| 0:19:02| Okay, we have a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=1142)|
| 0:19:04| Usually, we don't have much discussion on these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=1144)|
| 0:19:05| I was surprised.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=1145)|
| 0:19:07| Maybe I wanted to say something about the liquor store.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=1147)|
| 0:19:08| Yeah, we have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=1148)|

| 0:19:30| I would note that this is probably| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=1170)|
| 0:19:31| from the finance department, not from Mike Cherry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=1171)|
| 0:19:34| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=1174)|
| 0:19:35| The pension board shouldn't be running liquor stores.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=1175)|

| 0:19:42| Does it say that on the action?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=1182)|

| 0:20:25| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=1225)|
| 0:20:26| Councilman Dela Vopi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=1226)|
| 0:20:28| Yeah, I wonder if the chief would tell us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=1228)|
| 0:20:29| a little bit about this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=1229)|
| 0:20:30| because this is trying to address,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=1230)|
| 0:20:33| according to at least the information sheet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=1233)|
| 0:20:35| the problem we have with large trucks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=1235)|
| 0:20:37| coming through Knoxville on our interstates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=1237)|
| 0:20:39| and the potential hazard that you have to contain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=1239)|
| 0:20:42| if something happens,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=1242)|
| 0:20:43| but I think it's a matter of public interest,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=1243)|
| 0:20:45| and I hope you would discuss it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=1245)|
| 0:20:46| Yes, thanks for asking that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=1246)|
| 0:20:48| Yeah, we do have a lot of trucks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=1248)|
| 0:20:50| Obviously, we have two major interstates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=1250)|
| 0:20:52| running through here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=1252)|
| 0:20:53| We have a large petroleum terminal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=1253)|
| 0:20:59| on Middlebrook Pike,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=1259)|
| 0:21:01| so therefore, we have a lot of trucks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=1261)|
| 0:21:02| coming and going through there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=1262)|
| 0:21:04| and we also have a dedicated hazardous materials team| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=1264)|
| 0:21:08| that responds to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=1268)|
| 0:21:10| We also respond to regional incidents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=1270)|
| 0:21:13| outside of Knoxville City also,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=1273)|
| 0:21:16| and this is to just give us updated training on that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=1276)|
| 0:21:19| and it's also being the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=1279)|
| 0:21:22| part of it's being funded| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=1282)|
| 0:21:23| by the Petroleum Terminal Association,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=1283)|
| 0:21:26| so they see the importance of this, too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=1286)|
| 0:21:28| to provide us this updated training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=1288)|
| 0:21:31| Thank you much for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=1291)|
| 0:21:32| Okay, we have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=1292)|

| 0:22:17| Councilman Della Vopi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=1337)|
| 0:22:18| Yeah, I wonder if Jim York is here, or David.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=1338)|
| 0:22:20| He is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=1340)|
| 0:22:23| Jim, as you're coming down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=1343)|
| 0:22:23| if you would just tell us a little bit about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=1343)|
| 0:22:26| We have a list of, I don't know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=1346)|
| 0:22:28| about six or seven properties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=1348)|
| 0:22:29| but obviously this is part of that new act we passed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=1349)|
| 0:22:31| to enable us to sell property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=1351)|
| 0:22:34| rather than hold on to it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=1354)|
| 0:22:35| when the liens for taxes build up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=1355)|
| 0:22:39| to being more than it's worth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=1359)|
| 0:22:41| But you can tell us a little bit more about this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=1361)|
| 0:22:42| and how it works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=1362)|
| 0:22:44| Okay, Jim York, finance director for the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=1364)|
| 0:22:47| What this is, is this is part of our agreement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=1367)|
| 0:22:50| with Knox County, both parties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=1370)|
| 0:22:53| both Knox County and the city of Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=1373)|
| 0:22:56| do obtain properties through tax sales.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=1376)|
| 0:23:01| Oftentimes those properties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=1381)|
| 0:23:03| would be what we consider underwater| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=1383)|
| 0:23:05| in that the taxes and interest and penalties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=1385)|
| 0:23:08| are more than what the property is worth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=1388)|
| 0:23:13| As part of our efforts to turn these properties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=1393)|
| 0:23:18| back onto the tax roll,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=1398)|
| 0:23:20| we have agreed to waive our taxes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=1400)|
| 0:23:24| and then sell them for what the true market value| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=1404)|
| 0:23:27| of those properties are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=1407)|
| 0:23:29| And we will share proportionally| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=1409)|
| 0:23:31| in the proceeds from those sales.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=1411)|
| 0:23:34| You let the auction determine the real market price| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=1414)|
| 0:23:36| and don't worry about your finger on the lever| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=1416)|
| 0:23:39| with the tax lien.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=1419)|
| 0:23:40| In a tax sale, the city or the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=1420)|
| 0:23:42| both have to bid in both all the existing taxes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=1422)|
| 0:23:47| as well as interest and penalties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=1427)|
| 0:23:48| And so that's why we end up holding the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=1428)|
| 0:23:52| This just enables us to sell those at true market value| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=1432)|
| 0:23:55| and put them back on the tax rolls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=1435)|
| 0:23:59| Thank you very much for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=1439)|
| 0:24:00| Thank you, Jim.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=1440)|
| 0:24:01| Thank you, Councilman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=1441)|

| 0:24:07| The ayes have it and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=1447)|
| 0:24:08| 11H is a resolution authorizing the mayor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=1448)|
| 0:24:10| to execute any and all documents necessary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=1450)|
| 0:24:13| to apply for and accept the 2014| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=1453)|
| 0:24:15| Internet Crimes Against Children grant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=1455)|
| 0:24:18| in the amount of $240,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=1458)|
| 0:24:20| from the Tennessee Office of Criminal Justice Programs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=1460)|
| 0:24:23| for the purpose of employing an organizational strategy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=1463)|
| 0:24:25| to build new partnerships with entities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=1465)|

| 0:24:33| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=1473)|
| 0:24:34| Councilman Dallavopi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=1474)|
| 0:24:35| Yeah, I think it's worth asking Gary Price| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=1475)|
| 0:24:37| if he would, from the police department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=1477)|
| 0:24:39| if he would tell us a little bit about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=1479)|
| 0:24:41| This obviously is a program that's been ongoing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=1481)|
| 0:24:43| and I know that Knoxville's been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=1483)|
| 0:24:45| sort of a lead agency in the region,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=1485)|
| 0:24:47| but one of the things it mentions in here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=1487)|
| 0:24:49| as you discuss what it's about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=1489)|
| 0:24:51| is that we're funding two full positions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=1491)|
| 0:24:54| and I'm wondering what happens when the money dries up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=1494)|
| 0:24:57| if it dries up from Washington| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=1497)|
| 0:24:58| in terms of how we manage our business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=1498)|
| 0:25:01| Yes, sir, be glad to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=1501)|
| 0:25:03| There are actually two primary funding sources| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=1503)|
| 0:25:06| for the Internet Crimes Against Children Task Force.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=1506)|
| 0:25:09| One is federal grants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=1509)|
| 0:25:11| This particular item deals with a state funding mechanism.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=1511)|
| 0:25:16| It's an allocation from the state legislature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=1516)|
| 0:25:19| They actually allocate to Knoxville, Nashville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=1519)|
| 0:25:24| and Memphis for the three regions of the state,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=1524)|
| 0:25:27| but it's handled like a state grant would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=1527)|
| 0:25:30| in terms of application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=1530)|
| 0:25:32| Now, the two positions would be two sworn positions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=1532)|
| 0:25:37| that are actually part of our authorized strength| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=1537)|
| 0:25:40| of 416 that we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=1540)|
| 0:25:42| Oh, they're not in addition to that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=1542)|
| 0:25:44| they're part of the?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=1544)|
| 0:25:44| Yes, sir, they are part of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=1544)|
| 0:25:47| So if the funding went away,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=1547)|
| 0:25:49| our normal funding for those positions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=1549)|
| 0:25:54| would take care of those two slots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=1554)|
| 0:25:56| That helps, thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=1556)|
| 0:25:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=1559)|
| 0:26:00| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=1560)|

| 0:26:41| extending the term for an additional year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=1601)|
| 0:26:43| and providing for capital improvements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=1603)|

| 0:26:49| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=1609)|
| 0:26:50| I think it's a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=1610)|
| 0:26:52| Was there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=1612)|
| 0:26:53| Yes, second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=1613)|
| 0:26:54| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=1614)|
| 0:26:55| Councilman Del Vecchio.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=1615)|
| 0:26:56| Yeah, I noticed that Greg McKay is here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=1616)|
| 0:26:57| but ovation food services took over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=1617)|
| 0:27:00| and improved our concessions sometime in the past| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=1620)|
| 0:27:04| and this was part of an arrangement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=1624)|
| 0:27:07| where we had the option to renew.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=1627)|
| 0:27:08| And Greg, maybe you want to tell us about it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=1628)|
| 0:27:10| but the reports I'm getting from Chilhowee Park| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=1630)|
| 0:27:12| and others are that they're doing a very good job| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=1632)|
| 0:27:15| and they want to actually upgrade some of the service items| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=1635)|
| 0:27:18| at the Auditorium Coliseum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=1638)|
| 0:27:22| Greg, do you have something to add to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=1642)|
| 0:27:23| Actually, I think Deputy to the Mayor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=1643)|
| 0:27:25| Eddie Mass is going to respond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=1645)|
| 0:27:27| Yes, I'll address that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=1647)|
| 0:27:29| It is part of an agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=1649)|
| 0:27:30| I think it was a five-year agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=1650)|
| 0:27:32| It started with $100,000 investment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=1652)|
| 0:27:34| and then it was $75,000, $25,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=1654)|
| 0:27:38| and then an additional $20,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=1658)|
| 0:27:39| So, as part of that extension,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=1659)|
| 0:27:41| they're making $20,000 in capital improvements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=1661)|
| 0:27:45| for this one-year extension that will include an ice maker,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=1665)|
| 0:27:47| some stainless steel sinks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=1667)|
| 0:27:48| and I hear from what I understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=1668)|
| 0:27:50| that they are doing a fantastic job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=1670)|
| 0:27:51| The food is great,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=1671)|
| 0:27:53| so we're getting good reviews from Ovation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=1673)|
| 0:27:55| Yeah, and I might add that the only way we make money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=1675)|
| 0:27:58| at those facilities is any ticket proceeds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=1678)|
| 0:28:02| where it's a show that the city sponsors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=1682)|
| 0:28:04| the parking garage, and the concession.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=1684)|
| 0:28:06| So, to help offset the cost of running those facilities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=1686)|
| 0:28:10| concessions is an important leg of the stool,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=1690)|
| 0:28:13| and so it's important to have a good contractor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=1693)|
| 0:28:14| in there to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=1694)|
| 0:28:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=1696)|

| 0:29:16| So make the motion to just refer back to MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=1756)|
| 0:29:18| Motion to refer to MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=1758)|
| 0:29:21| Okay, we have a motion and a second| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=1761)|
| 0:29:23| to refer this back to MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=1763)|
| 0:29:25| Councilwoman Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=1765)|
| 0:29:26| We do have all the notes that need to accompany this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=1766)|
| 0:29:30| going back to MPC so that we don't keep reconsidering this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=1770)|
| 0:29:35| for several more months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=1775)|
| 0:29:37| Yes, I am meeting with Mr. Donaldson,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=1777)|
| 0:29:41| who's out of town, and Mrs. Halber| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=1781)|
| 0:29:43| on Thursday morning of this week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=1783)|
| 0:29:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=1787)|
| 0:29:49| Good point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=1789)|
| 0:29:50| Okay, we have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=1790)|
| 0:29:52| All in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=1792)|
| 0:29:54| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=1794)|
| 0:29:54| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=1794)|
| 0:29:55| The ayes have it, and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=1795)|
| 0:29:57| 12B is an ordinance to amend the Knoxville City Code| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=1797)|
| 0:29:59| Appendix V zoning regulations to permit courtyard development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=1799)|
| 0:30:03| in some residential zone districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=1803)|
| 0:30:06| I would move for approval,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=1806)|
| 0:30:08| and then I would like to offer something if it gives a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=1808)|
| 0:30:11| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=1811)|
| 0:30:12| Okay, we have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=1812)|
| 0:30:13| We also have some people to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=1813)|
| 0:30:15| Do you want to hear them speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=1815)|
| 0:30:17| Let me offer an amendment before, if I could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=1817)|
| 0:30:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=1822)|
| 0:30:23| And that would be, the amendment would be to remove R1A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=1823)|
| 0:30:29| The zone, R1A?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=1829)|
| 0:30:30| Correct, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=1830)|
| 0:30:30| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=1830)|
| 0:30:34| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=1834)|
| 0:30:36| Okay, so we have a motion to amend,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=1836)|
| 0:30:43| which would be to remove R1A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=1843)|
| 0:30:48| Councilman Della Vopi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=1848)|
| 0:30:49| Yes, thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=1849)|
| 0:30:50| You have a second on that, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=1850)|
| 0:30:51| We have a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=1851)|
| 0:30:51| He got a second from Mr. Marshall Starr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=1851)|
| 0:30:54| Yeah, I think that when we had the workshop the other day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=1854)|
| 0:30:57| that that was one of the major comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=1857)|
| 0:30:59| It was also a comment made before MPC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=1859)|
| 0:31:01| by several of the neighborhood groups.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=1861)|
| 0:31:03| And I think that, based on the discussion I sat through anyway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=1863)|
| 0:31:08| and listened at the workshop,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=1868)|
| 0:31:11| that folks want to step in this a little bit more quietly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=1871)|
| 0:31:15| and calmly because there are questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=1875)|
| 0:31:17| about what happens to low-density residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=1877)|
| 0:31:20| versus medium-density residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=1880)|
| 0:31:22| Courtyards allow more density,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=1882)|
| 0:31:24| and we didn't want to rush into putting that into the zones| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=1884)|
| 0:31:27| that have more single-family housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=1887)|
| 0:31:30| And it may be something that gets expanded in the future,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=1890)|
| 0:31:32| but it didn't seem like a good place to start.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=1892)|
| 0:31:35| I think that issue and possibly the consideration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=1895)|
| 0:31:40| of more standards like we have in the historical zoning area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=1900)|
| 0:31:44| not that those would be the same things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=1904)|
| 0:31:46| but standards that could help guide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=1906)|
| 0:31:49| good courtyard development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=1909)|
| 0:31:51| And I think I saw a bulletin board over there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=1911)|
| 0:31:53| some of the examples that MPC came up with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=1913)|
| 0:31:56| after our workshop that helped us all see that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=1916)|
| 0:31:59| Obviously, if they turn out good,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=1919)|
| 0:32:01| it's a wonderful addition to Knoxville's communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=1921)|
| 0:32:05| And if they are done poorly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=1925)|
| 0:32:07| or without careful workmanship and standards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=1927)|
| 0:32:11| they might detract from neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=1931)|
| 0:32:12| So that's my read of what happened at the workshop anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=1932)|
| 0:32:16| So I'm going to support the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=1936)|
| 0:32:18| Councilwoman Palmer, we do have some speakers lined up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=1938)|
| 0:32:21| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=1941)|
| 0:32:22| We do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=1942)|
| 0:32:23| After those speakers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=1943)|
| 0:32:24| I would like to address Councilman Delavaux's comments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=1944)|
| 0:32:27| in the workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=1947)|
| 0:32:28| Okay, we have another.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=1948)|
| 0:32:29| Do you want to speak now or wait until after?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=1949)|
| 0:32:31| You can wait and take the vote after they speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=1951)|
| 0:32:33| That's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=1953)|
| 0:32:34| Right, right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=1954)|
| 0:32:35| We'll speak after.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=1955)|
| 0:32:36| Okay, I have two people signed up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=1956)|
| 0:32:37| First is Charlotte Davis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=1957)|
| 0:32:38| Nice to see you here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=1958)|
| 0:32:39| Ms. Davis, please state your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=1959)|
| 0:32:40| And as you know, you have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=1960)|
| 0:32:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=1961)|
| 0:32:42| Charlotte Davis, 104 Crawford Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=1962)|
| 0:32:43| in Fountain City.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=1963)|
| 0:32:44| Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=1964)|
| 0:32:45| I attended the workshop last week| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=1965)|
| 0:32:46| and I've given a lot of thought to the discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=1966)|
| 0:32:55| concerning courtyard development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=1975)|
| 0:33:05| And I don't believe that this type of development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=1985)|
| 0:33:08| will fit into our neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=1988)|
| 0:33:11| I can't visualize up to 12 houses being 10 feet apart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=1991)|
| 0:33:18| What if your neighbors on either side or both sides| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=1998)|
| 0:33:22| have barking dogs, crying babies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=2002)|
| 0:33:25| young children getting into it as children normally do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=2005)|
| 0:33:30| Or if your neighbor has a car with a loud muffler| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=2010)|
| 0:33:33| going to work at 6 o'clock in the morning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=2013)|
| 0:33:35| or coming home at midnight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=2015)|
| 0:33:38| you can't always choose who your neighbors are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=2018)|
| 0:33:42| I believe that any one of us would prefer to have our home| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=2022)|
| 0:33:48| further than 10 feet from our neighbors' homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=2028)|
| 0:33:51| I'm not saying that we don't need smaller homes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=2031)|
| 0:33:54| for some of our citizens,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=2034)|
| 0:33:57| but why not just build small houses on small lots?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=2037)|
| 0:34:02| Personally, I would like to see this tabled,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=2042)|
| 0:34:07| but if you vote to try courtyard development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=2047)|
| 0:34:11| I hope that you act on Councilwoman Palmer's suggestion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=2051)|
| 0:34:16| to have eight homes rather than 12.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=2056)|
| 0:34:19| And also remember Councilman Della Vopi's suggestion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=2059)|
| 0:34:23| to build one unit of courtyard homes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=2063)|
| 0:34:27| and then we could better visualize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=2067)|
| 0:34:30| We would visualize rather than we would see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=2070)|
| 0:34:33| rather than visualize eight to 12 homes 10 feet apart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=2073)|
| 0:34:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=2080)|
| 0:34:41| Thank you, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=2081)|
| 0:34:43| The next speaker is Ms. Terri Faulkner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=2083)|
| 0:34:47| Terri, you know the rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=2087)|
| 0:34:48| I won't repeat them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=2088)|
| 0:34:49| You've been here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=2089)|
| 0:34:51| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=2091)|
| 0:34:52| I'm Terri Faulkner, 4178 Ridgeway Lane, 37919.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=2092)|
| 0:34:58| And I never take an opportunity or never miss an opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=2098)|
| 0:35:02| to say thank you, and tonight I'd just like to publicly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=2102)|
| 0:35:05| thank someone that Councilman Greer forgot to thank.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=2105)|
| 0:35:09| KUB has donated 13 trees to be added| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=2109)|
| 0:35:12| along the Third Creek Ringway behind the UT Athletic Fields,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=2112)|
| 0:35:16| and that will be Thursday, an Arbor Day event at 1 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=2116)|
| 0:35:22| And anyway, we want to thank KUB| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=2122)|
| 0:35:24| for helping beautify our area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=2124)|
| 0:35:28| I'm speaking as the president of the Burden Council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=2128)|
| 0:35:32| and the Council voted to support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=2132)|
| 0:35:35| the Courtyard Development Coordinates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=2135)|
| 0:35:41| if the R1A is removed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=2141)|
| 0:35:44| And thank you, Councilman Saunders,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=2144)|
| 0:35:46| for voting to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=2146)|
| 0:35:48| So that is our position on that, and I was afraid| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=2148)|
| 0:35:52| I sent my email too late for everyone to get it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=2152)|
| 0:35:54| which is why I'm taking your time now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=2154)|
| 0:35:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=2157)|
| 0:35:58| Thank you very much, Ms. Faulkner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=2158)|
| 0:36:03| Okay, Councilwoman Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=2163)|
| 0:36:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=2164)|
| 0:36:05| We had a workshop Thursday that really examined| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=2165)|
| 0:36:09| this courtyard development fairly carefully.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=2169)|
| 0:36:12| I remember when we asked MPC to look into it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=2172)|
| 0:36:16| and they have come back with their look,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=2176)|
| 0:36:19| and quite frankly, I'm not at all comfortable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=2179)|
| 0:36:22| that as a council, we really understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=2182)|
| 0:36:25| and know enough about the courtyard concept| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=2185)|
| 0:36:28| to be taking action at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=2188)|
| 0:36:31| I think there are some really positive components| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=2191)|
| 0:36:34| to the courtyard development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=2194)|
| 0:36:36| I think there are some legitimate concerns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=2196)|
| 0:36:39| that some folks have expressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=2199)|
| 0:36:42| I think we talked about maybe trying just one development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=2202)|
| 0:36:45| and seeing how that flies, but you can't undo| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=2205)|
| 0:36:48| an ordinance as easily as you can do one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=2208)|
| 0:36:50| So I'm going to, I think that we need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=2210)|
| 0:36:53| some outside expertise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=2213)|
| 0:36:57| I'm not discounting MPC, but I think we need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=2217)|
| 0:37:00| some third-party expertise, either from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=2220)|
| 0:37:03| the UT Planning Department or from MTAS,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=2223)|
| 0:37:06| that can help us better understand how this might go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=2226)|
| 0:37:11| We got some photographs from MPC of two-story houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=2231)|
| 0:37:15| Other places I've looked at this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=2235)|
| 0:37:17| it's always been one story, and it's really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=2237)|
| 0:37:20| been directed towards seniors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=2240)|
| 0:37:22| So I really don't think I know enough about this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=2242)|
| 0:37:25| and I'm not confident that my fellow council members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=2245)|
| 0:37:28| really know enough about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=2248)|
| 0:37:30| A few years ago, a different council looked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=2250)|
| 0:37:33| at a development called the Town Center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=2253)|
| 0:37:35| and that was the latest thing, and that was it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=2255)|
| 0:37:38| And it was a great concept, it was wonderful on paper,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=2258)|
| 0:37:41| but it also didn't exactly fly well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=2261)|
| 0:37:44| and certainly didn't fit with development plans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=2264)|
| 0:37:47| even before the recession of 2008.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=2267)|
| 0:37:50| So I would ask my colleagues to table this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=2270)|
| 0:37:54| so that we have an opportunity to get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=2274)|
| 0:37:56| a much better understanding, and then we can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=2276)|
| 0:37:59| bring it back out, take out what needs to be taken out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=2279)|
| 0:38:03| develop some standards, see what kind of standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=2283)|
| 0:38:06| need to be developed, rather than just blindly voting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=2286)|
| 0:38:09| on something that we think we know something about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=2289)|
| 0:38:12| but maybe we don't know enough about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=2292)|
| 0:38:14| to be making a sound decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=2294)|
| 0:38:17| Okay, there's a motion to table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=2297)|
| 0:38:19| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=2299)|
| 0:38:20| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=2300)|
| 0:38:21| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=2301)|
| 0:38:22| That's a priority motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=2302)|
| 0:38:25| Do you want to speak to that, then, Councilor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=2305)|
| 0:38:27| Yeah, I'll speak to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=2307)|
| 0:38:28| I agree with Councilwoman Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=2308)|
| 0:38:31| You know, the photos look nice and what have you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=2311)|
| 0:38:34| but I can also see some really shoddy developments happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=2314)|
| 0:38:39| I like what Councilman Della Vopi said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=2319)|
| 0:38:42| in that, you know, we need to define| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=2322)|
| 0:38:46| exactly what can go in there, because it could really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=2326)|
| 0:38:48| turn into some just shoddy development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=2328)|
| 0:38:52| and a lot of that could go in places| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=2332)|
| 0:38:56| where it would be very detrimental to the neighborhoods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=2336)|
| 0:38:59| and weaken them even more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=2339)|
| 0:39:01| So, I'm just not ready to pull the trigger on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=2341)|
| 0:39:05| I think it's something I agree with Councilwoman Palmer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=2345)|
| 0:39:08| again, that we need to hastily move into this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=2348)|
| 0:39:12| I don't think there's a huge groundswell of developers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=2352)|
| 0:39:16| that are waiting in line to start this type of development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=2356)|
| 0:39:19| so I'm going to support the tabling motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=2359)|
| 0:39:22| and just see where it goes from there, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=2362)|
| 0:39:26| Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=2366)|
| 0:39:27| Yeah, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=2367)|
| 0:39:28| Well, I've thought about this a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=2368)|
| 0:39:31| Obviously, I'm in the residential real estate business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=2371)|
| 0:39:34| lifelong resident of Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=2374)|
| 0:39:36| and studied similar projects around| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=2376)|
| 0:39:38| and participated in the worksite last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=2378)|
| 0:39:42| I'm very opposed to it being an R1A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=2382)|
| 0:39:46| I think that would be a huge mistake,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=2386)|
| 0:39:48| but I really don't think we're ready for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=2388)|
| 0:39:50| I think the limited appeal to a courtyard development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=2390)|
| 0:39:54| opens up the unintended consequences| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=2394)|
| 0:39:57| of what just Vice Mayor just said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=2397)|
| 0:39:59| of an opportunity for poor development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=2399)|
| 0:40:02| in the good areas and the wrong development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=2402)|
| 0:40:06| You already have an opportunity to have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=2406)|
| 0:40:09| according to what's in front of us tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=2409)|
| 0:40:12| the RP1, RP2, RP3 already allow a type of housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=2412)|
| 0:40:20| similar to a courtyard development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=2420)|
| 0:40:22| and there's very little of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=2422)|
| 0:40:24| The traditional neighborhood development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=2424)|
| 0:40:26| there are a few of those around,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=2426)|
| 0:40:28| and they've had limited success in holding values| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=2428)|
| 0:40:32| and in selling out from the beginning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=2432)|
| 0:40:35| And courtyard development is a variation of that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=2435)|
| 0:40:39| that I believe would just not have much success.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=2439)|
| 0:40:45| I think you're opening up a whole new zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=2445)|
| 0:40:47| for something that has very little appeal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=2447)|
| 0:40:49| and will have very little traction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=2449)|
| 0:40:53| And you've got other opportunities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=2453)|
| 0:40:54| and other style developments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=2454)|
| 0:40:56| and I'm fine with table net,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=2456)|
| 0:40:59| but I'm opposed to moving forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=2459)|
| 0:41:01| on the courtyard development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=2461)|
| 0:41:05| Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=2465)|
| 0:41:06| Yes, Mayor, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=2466)|
| 0:41:07| I'm concerned about the increased density| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=2467)|
| 0:41:11| in an urban setting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=2471)|
| 0:41:13| and whether or not that is such a good thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=2473)|
| 0:41:17| because when you have increased density,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=2477)|
| 0:41:19| it brings on other problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=2479)|
| 0:41:22| So I'm somewhat in agreement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=2482)|
| 0:41:25| with what Council Member Palmer has said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=2485)|
| 0:41:28| We may need to take a little more, better look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=2488)|
| 0:41:33| But I just wanted to say I'm very concerned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=2493)|
| 0:41:34| about the increased density with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=2494)|
| 0:41:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=2498)|
| 0:41:38| Councilman Saunders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=2498)|
| 0:41:39| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=2499)|
| 0:41:40| I respect very much my colleagues' caution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=2500)|
| 0:41:43| and cautious approach to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=2503)|
| 0:41:45| I would ask, and maybe this is a question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=2505)|
| 0:41:48| for the Law Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=2508)|
| 0:41:52| I'm kind of looking for a time period| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=2512)|
| 0:41:56| and an agenda of where are we going?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=2516)|
| 0:41:58| What is it that we don't know that we need to know?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=2518)|
| 0:42:01| Can we set a limit that this might be brought off the table| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=2521)|
| 0:42:05| and back for our consideration?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=2525)|
| 0:42:07| I'm just trying to figure out the steps| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=2527)|
| 0:42:08| to get this back in front of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=2528)|
| 0:42:11| Just to explain how motion for tabling works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=2531)|
| 0:42:17| If the motion for putting it on the table passes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=2537)|
| 0:42:20| then we would have to have a motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=2540)|
| 0:42:22| to take it off of the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=2542)|
| 0:42:23| So what would happen is somebody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=2543)|
| 0:42:26| who wants to take it off of the table,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=2546)|
| 0:42:28| who's done whatever they want to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=2548)|
| 0:42:30| after it is on the table,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=2550)|
| 0:42:32| then really would call my office and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=2552)|
| 0:42:35| I would like to move to take this off of the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=2555)|
| 0:42:37| So we would put it on the agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=2557)|
| 0:42:39| put this item back on the agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=2559)|
| 0:42:40| along with motion to take off the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=2560)|
| 0:42:43| It would come before the council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=2563)|
| 0:42:45| and then the council would vote| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=2565)|
| 0:42:46| whether or not to take it back off the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=2566)|
| 0:42:49| That is in distinction to the motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=2569)|
| 0:42:55| to postpone for a set time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=2575)|
| 0:42:58| I guess that's where I was going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=2578)|
| 0:42:59| because I'm trying to figure out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=2579)|
| 0:43:01| is there a limit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=2581)|
| 0:43:02| I guess for Councilwoman Palmer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=2582)|
| 0:43:04| maybe I should address my question to her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=2584)|
| 0:43:07| May I answer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=2587)|
| 0:43:08| Sure, Councilwoman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=2588)|
| 0:43:09| My thought was that we would table it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=2589)|
| 0:43:11| for the time being,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=2591)|
| 0:43:12| arrange to have a workshop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=2592)|
| 0:43:14| because it will take some time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=2594)|
| 0:43:16| to get some outside experts ready and set to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=2596)|
| 0:43:20| We do that and then if we want to at that point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=2600)|
| 0:43:23| we can untable it, bring it back out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=2603)|
| 0:43:26| make the amendment, do whatever we need to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=2606)|
| 0:43:29| If we know that we need some new standards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=2609)|
| 0:43:31| we can send it back to MPC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=2611)|
| 0:43:32| without those recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=2612)|
| 0:43:34| But that we would have some time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=2614)|
| 0:43:38| and not feel pressured| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=2618)|
| 0:43:39| and certainly not have this scheduled| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=2619)|
| 0:43:41| with another topic at a workshop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=2621)|
| 0:43:44| so that we had a full 90 minutes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=2624)|
| 0:43:46| to devote to learning from people in planning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=2626)|
| 0:43:50| or MTAS who really understand this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=2630)|
| 0:43:53| and see what the ramifications are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=2633)|
| 0:43:56| what are the positives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=2636)|
| 0:43:57| And we may decide at the end of that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=2637)|
| 0:43:58| that this is it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=2638)|
| 0:44:00| This is the best thing that we can do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=2640)|
| 0:44:02| in zoning in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=2642)|
| 0:44:03| Or we may ask ourselves,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=2643)|
| 0:44:05| what in the world?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=2645)|
| 0:44:07| Or we may just move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=2647)|
| 0:44:09| But I really, this was my thinking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=2649)|
| 0:44:12| that we need some time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=2652)|
| 0:44:13| I'm trying to table it to buy time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=2653)|
| 0:44:15| knowing full well that that doesn't vote it down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=2655)|
| 0:44:18| because from what I'm hearing tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=2658)|
| 0:44:20| I kind of think this could go down the drain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=2660)|
| 0:44:24| and that may not be where we want it to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=2664)|
| 0:44:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=2666)|
| 0:44:27| And I would propose, if I may,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=2667)|
| 0:44:31| that Ms. Palmer, you and I team up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=2671)|
| 0:44:34| and get with MTAS, get with MPC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=2674)|
| 0:44:37| whoever, whatever expertise we can find| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=2677)|
| 0:44:40| and arrange those workshops| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=2680)|
| 0:44:43| so that we can at least figure out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=2683)|
| 0:44:45| whether we want to do something with this or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=2685)|
| 0:44:47| If that is the wishes of my colleagues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=2687)|
| 0:44:51| I would be very happy to work with you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=2691)|
| 0:44:53| Councilman Saunders, on this matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=2693)|
| 0:44:56| On many matters, I'm sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=2696)|
| 0:44:58| This is the one that's on the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=2698)|
| 0:45:01| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=2701)|
| 0:45:02| Councilman Graves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=2702)|
| 0:45:03| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=2703)|
| 0:45:04| I just want to make sure that it doesn't die.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=2704)|
| 0:45:06| In other words, that the intent here is to keep it alive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=2706)|
| 0:45:10| But I agree with Councilman Della Vopi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=2710)|
| 0:45:13| One of the things I'm concerned about are the standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=2713)|
| 0:45:15| and the design standards that are required.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=2715)|
| 0:45:18| And I didn't know whether we send that back to MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=2718)|
| 0:45:20| I like your idea, but I just want to make sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=2720)|
| 0:45:22| and publicly make sure that we don't let it die,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=2722)|
| 0:45:25| that this is not an end run on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=2725)|
| 0:45:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=2728)|
| 0:45:29| Well, this is why I suggested tabling,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=2729)|
| 0:45:29| because I don't want it to die.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=2729)|
| 0:45:31| I don't want to send anything else back to MPC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=2731)|
| 0:45:33| without really specific instructions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=2733)|
| 0:45:36| about how we want this to look when it comes back to us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=2736)|
| 0:45:39| because we've had that conversation with Mr. Donaldson| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=2739)|
| 0:45:42| and others at MPC that we send things back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=2742)|
| 0:45:44| with this vague whatever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=2744)|
| 0:45:46| and it comes back and we're still not happy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=2746)|
| 0:45:48| So this would give us an opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=2748)|
| 0:45:50| to work with some outsiders, work with MPC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=2750)|
| 0:45:53| and then get this fine-tuned or kill it off,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=2753)|
| 0:45:57| whatever we need to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=2757)|
| 0:45:58| But I definitely don't want to see this die.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=2758)|
| 0:46:00| I want it to have some time to be looked at carefully.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=2760)|
| 0:46:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=2765)|
| 0:46:06| Councilman Dallavopi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=2766)|
| 0:46:07| Yes, thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=2767)|
| 0:46:08| Well, I certainly have to agree with my colleagues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=2768)|
| 0:46:10| because we spent probably the bulk of the time on Thursday| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=2770)|
| 0:46:12| talking about what will it look like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=2772)|
| 0:46:15| how do you picture this going,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=2775)|
| 0:46:17| and the devil's always in the details.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=2777)|
| 0:46:20| Does it turn out to be a neighborhood-enhancing tool,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=2780)|
| 0:46:23| or does it turn out to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=2783)|
| 0:46:25| sort of a neighborhood-destroying tool,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=2785)|
| 0:46:27| and we certainly don't want the latter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=2787)|
| 0:46:29| So if we have a mechanism for looking at it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=2789)|
| 0:46:31| I think it's a good idea that we do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=2791)|
| 0:46:33| I don't know if we should engage MPC to help us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=2793)|
| 0:46:38| or engage somehow the developer community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=2798)|
| 0:46:41| to come in and talk to us at the same time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=2801)|
| 0:46:43| so we can get input not only from design professionals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=2803)|
| 0:46:47| but on-the-ground practical folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=2807)|
| 0:46:49| But there's been a lot of good points raised,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=2809)|
| 0:46:51| including the fact of what do you do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=2811)|
| 0:46:52| when the kid's going crazy 10 feet away?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=2812)|
| 0:46:56| I mean, maybe waking you up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=2816)|
| 0:46:58| when you don't want to be woken up, so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=2818)|
| 0:47:01| Councilman Stair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=2821)|
| 0:47:02| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=2822)|
| 0:47:03| I certainly respect everything everybody's said tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=2823)|
| 0:47:05| I mean, I'm actually okay moving forward with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=2825)|
| 0:47:09| You know, I think, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=2829)|
| 0:47:12| you can sort of imagine the worst,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=2832)|
| 0:47:14| but we're limiting it to R2,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=2834)|
| 0:47:15| which R's allow dense development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=2835)|
| 0:47:20| You know, there's all types of terrible development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=2840)|
| 0:47:23| you know, around this county, apartment complexes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=2843)|
| 0:47:28| I just don't see this as that thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=2848)|
| 0:47:31| I mean, I haven't lived in a single family home| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=2851)|
| 0:47:33| since, I guess, early 90s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=2853)|
| 0:47:35| So, I mean, just coming from my background,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=2855)|
| 0:47:38| I mean, I've got people below me and next to me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=2858)|
| 0:47:40| and if they're, you know, there's all those type of issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=2860)|
| 0:47:43| But, you know, I think as a city, we're not annexing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=2863)|
| 0:47:49| We're not really growing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=2869)|
| 0:47:50| and we've got to look at the different tools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=2870)|
| 0:47:52| we can use to grow our tax base.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=2872)|
| 0:47:56| And I see this possibly as one of them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=2876)|
| 0:47:59| and we're trying to make our neighborhoods more desirable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=2879)|
| 0:48:05| Throughout my entire life, all the growth has been out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=2885)|
| 0:48:08| Outside of the city is growing tremendously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=2888)|
| 0:48:11| We need to look at the tools we can use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=2891)|
| 0:48:15| to bring people back into our neighborhoods,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=2895)|
| 0:48:18| the neighborhoods we love.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=2898)|
| 0:48:20| And I think this could be a tool.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=2900)|
| 0:48:22| I'm okay with moving forward with it tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=2902)|
| 0:48:24| but I understand, doesn't look like that's where it's going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=2904)|
| 0:48:30| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=2910)|
| 0:48:30| Good discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=2910)|
| 0:48:31| We have a motion and a second to table this 12B.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=2911)|
| 0:48:38| So, all in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=2918)|
| 0:48:40| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=2920)|
| 0:48:41| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=2921)|
| 0:48:42| The ayes have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=2922)|
| 0:48:44| Did you vote no?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=2924)|
| 0:48:45| Okay, we have one no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=2925)|
| 0:48:46| So, eight to one, and the motion to table passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=2926)|
| 0:48:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=2932)|
| 0:48:55| We have no one signed up for public forum,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=2935)|
| 0:48:57| so there being no further business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=2937)|
| 0:48:59| this meeting is adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=2939)|
| 0:49:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130305?start=2953)|
