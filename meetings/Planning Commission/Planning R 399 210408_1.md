| 2:37:54| when my two kids were last in Gibbs Elementary was 2012 or 13. At that time that many years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=9474)|
| 2:38:02| it was maxed out. I mean, the classrooms all were in use, they were all full. I just don't know what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=9482)|
| 2:38:08| we're going to do with all the extra kids, at least in the elementary, I can't speak to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=9488)|
| 2:38:13| middle of the high school. We've got a nice instead of a four-way stop, we've got this nice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=9493)|
| 2:38:18| traffic light now. But the elementary school traffic backs up on Tazewell Pike in the mornings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=9498)|
| 2:38:26| especially early in the school year regularly. I mean, backs up Tazewell Pike going southbound.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=9506)|
| 2:38:32| And every day at pickup, the left lane is backed way up. Of course, it's the left turn lane, so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=9512)|
| 2:38:37| it's not as intrusive. But we just kind of feel already the schools, at least the elementary for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=9517)|
| 2:38:44| sure is maxed out. Thank you, Mr. Richards. I apologize, but your time is up and we need to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=9524)|
| 2:38:50| move on. Chair recognizes Mr. Sanderson, you still have time available to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=9530)|
| 2:38:57| Thank you, Chairman. And is there any way staff could, I submitted some public comments and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=9537)|
| 2:39:01| attached to the public comments was a concept that our engineers have laid out. Is there any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=9541)|
| 2:39:07| way staff could pull that up on the screen, or is that I just need to verbally describe it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=9547)|
| 2:39:32| Thank you so much. This is what we had envisioned. We've been out there core drilling the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=9572)|
| 2:39:39| we've been out there studying the property, spent some time, obviously spent some money doing this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=9579)|
| 2:39:46| know what we're getting ourselves into when we're looking at property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=9586)|
| 2:39:50| very aware of the soil conditions. And we have made the decision to not cross the creek and we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=9590)|
| 2:39:59| would like to cluster, as Mr. Kevin said, cluster our subdivision onto the west side of it. And with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=9599)|
| 2:40:08| the 150 lots, we can justify additional amenities. The concerns of Campbell Point, you can kind of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=9608)|
| 2:40:16| see how we'll just do a single JPE or joint permanent easement serving five lots that would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=9616)|
| 2:40:24| run utilities to and let the homeowner or landowner or lot owner buy the lot and build an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=9624)|
| 2:40:30| estate home that would be a win, in my opinion, backing up to Campbell Point as opposed to our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=9630)|
| 2:40:37| subdivision. So there will be a buffer between us and Campbell Point. So I think we can alleviate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=9637)|
| 2:40:43| that concern as far as property value or anything like that. The soil, the rock, the flooding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=9643)|
| 2:40:50| obviously, we're Smithville homes. I know y'all can't carry too much weight in a discussion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=9650)|
| 2:40:55| but we know what we are doing. And last, we get calls every day. Y'all know there's a housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=9655)|
| 2:41:01| shortage. There's definitely one out there. And we get calls all the time, come to get us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=9661)|
| 2:41:05| come to get us. We got a school, we want to be out there. And at one unit acre, we go in there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=9665)|
| 2:41:12| we put 71 lots, no traffic study, nothing, no amenities. We build 71 lots and move on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=9672)|
| 2:41:18| With two units an acre, we can do 140 fold forward with amenities. And I'll leave it at that. Thank| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=9678)|
| 2:41:23| you, Chairman. Thank you, Mr. Sanderson. Chair recognizes Commissioner Scott Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=9683)|
| 2:41:34| Thank you. You know, I'm not seeing the five units an acre, obviously, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=9694)|
| 2:41:40| a question for Josh Sanderson. How big, I saw on your plan, where you lay out an amenity area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=9700)|
| 2:41:46| like a park, I guess that is. How many, how big is that, that area? Yes. Probably four to five acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=9706)|
| 2:41:53| Yeah. I mean, I could support like two units an acre on this because it seems to be a good| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=9713)|
| 2:42:00| compromise between getting these amenities. We always are so interested in seeing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=9720)|
| 2:42:06| you know, large lots, preserving the larger lot nature on half the property. You know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=9726)|
| 2:42:12| we're right close to a new school. So, and I do think that, I don't understand why we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=9732)|
| 2:42:16| couldn't consider a sector plan change, maybe to rural residential with two units an acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=9736)|
| 2:42:22| given the nature of how close it is to the school and how new the school is. I think it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=9742)|
| 2:42:26| was just finished like in 2019. Those are just my thoughts. I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=9746)|
| 2:42:33| Those are just my thoughts. I don't know if anybody has anything else on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=9753)|
| 2:42:37| Commissioner, was that a question to Ms. Poirier on the sector plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=9757)|
| 2:42:47| Yes, it was. Wait, could we do, you could not do two units an acre in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=9767)|
| 2:42:51| ag sector plan, but, and we wouldn't want to go maybe to LDR, but I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=9771)|
| 2:42:55| would rural residential allow that? Rural residential would allow two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=9775)|
| 2:43:01| dwelling units per acre. That is correct. And it is supported by the rural area of the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=9781)|
| 2:43:08| The only reason we're not recommending that is just because we felt like it was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=9788)|
| 2:43:12| spot zoning, but yes, it would be allowed technically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=9792)|
| 2:43:17| Thank you, Ms. Poirier. Chair recognizes Commissioner Roth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=9797)|
| 2:43:24| Thanks, Pat. Ms. Poirier, just I was going to ask you real quick. I was just,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=9804)|
| 2:43:28| as I was researching this yesterday and this morning, in the comments, it says that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=9808)|
| 2:43:35| rural residential would be spot zoning, but I look at the map and there is rural residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=9815)|
| 2:43:42| around this area. So I don't know why that would be in conflict or why it wouldn't,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=9822)|
| 2:43:48| why it would be a spot zoning, unless I'm missing something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=9828)|
| 2:43:54| Yeah, he's got... And I think RR makes sense. Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=9834)|
| 2:43:57| No, that's okay. He's got the map pulled up right now. I see no rural residential, it's all ag.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=9837)|
| 2:44:04| Well, I was looking at the, I'm looking at the packet. I'm looking at it right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=9844)|
| 2:44:10| There's a color coded, there's a color coded map and there's rural residential to the left,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=9850)|
| 2:44:19| there's rural residential above, there's rural residential to the right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=9859)|
| 2:44:24| I'm sorry, that's the existing land use. That's just showing kind of a classification of what's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=9864)|
| 2:44:30| existing. It's not a land use classification that we use. It's kind of confusing, but it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=9870)|
| 2:44:34| different from this sector plan designation. So the maps are labeled underneath the image,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=9874)|
| 2:44:40| and that one is the existing land use map. The sector plan map is the one below that in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=9880)|
| 2:44:45| exhibit. And that's the one that shows what the sector plan designations are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=9885)|
| 2:44:50| All right. Okay. All right. Thank you. Chair recognizes Commissioner Depp.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=9890)|
| 2:44:59| Thank you. I have a question for the applicant, Josh Sanderson. I think I'm new to the phrase| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=9899)|
| 2:45:07| estate lot. How would that work? Did you say that someone could basically purchase that lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=9907)|
| 2:45:15| and then they can develop it into a home like an estate as they wish?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=9915)|
| 2:45:20| Yeah. So what we would do is land that we're not using as common area or for our development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=9920)|
| 2:45:27| as far as a house seat, we would have a driveway or a 25 foot JPE that can serve, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=9927)|
| 2:45:34| up to five units or five homes. So run a JPE down the middle of the east side and sell those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=9934)|
| 2:45:43| mini farms off or estate lots off to individuals who want to have a bigger house or whatever size| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=9943)|
| 2:45:51| house they want to with a farm and just have some land. I know we get that a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=9951)|
| 2:45:58| Okay. Thank you. And then I had one question for Michelle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=9958)|
| 2:46:04| Do you, does staff typically frown upon spot zoning with there not being a lot of real| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=9964)|
| 2:46:11| residential since this is agricultural? Yes. So spot zoning is technically a legal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=9971)|
| 2:46:20| this wouldn't technically be spot zoning because it's a sector plan amendment and not a zone that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=9980)|
| 2:46:25| it's kind of, in practice, we're looking at it as being sort of a similar concept. The idea being| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=9985)|
| 2:46:31| here's one instance of this particular designation without any precedent for it being in existence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=9991)|
| 2:46:38| anywhere around it. And in this case, it's the entire sector. Okay. That actually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=9998)|
| 2:46:46| Yeah. I just wanted to ask. Okay. What would have been nearby| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=10006)|
| 2:46:49| request to approve the recommended approval of rural residential?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=10009)|
| 2:46:54| Okay. And I might have, I think I asked this question earlier. In this particular context| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=10014)|
| 2:46:59| between rural residential and low density residential, besides the fact that there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=10019)|
| 2:47:05| low density residential all around, is there a reason to lean towards low density versus rural?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=10025)|
| 2:47:13| So the growth policy plan does not allow consideration of the LDR land use. So the LDR| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=10033)|
| 2:47:20| that you see that's to the south of the site, that's actually in the planned growth area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=10040)|
| 2:47:26| Yeah. So that's kind of the difference between the two areas in this particular| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=10046)|
| 2:47:30| instance. It does. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=10050)|
| 2:47:37| Thank you, Commissioner. Chair recognizes Commissioner Adams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=10057)|
| 2:47:41| Thank you. I appreciate staff's assessment and recommendation for the one dwelling unit per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=10061)|
| 2:47:49| But to Commissioner Smith's point, I also really appreciate the applicant's reference to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=10069)|
| 2:47:57| sidewalks and other amenities that truly we are looking for these so often. I'm concerned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=10077)|
| 2:48:06| however, because they've been mentioned. But we have seen many times mentions of these things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=10086)|
| 2:48:14| that never come to pass. And for that reason, I'm going to continue to support the staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=10094)|
| 2:48:22| recommendation for one dwelling unit per acre. Thank you, Commissioner. Chair recognizes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=10102)|
| 2:48:29| Commissioner Oden. Yeah, Pat. Thank you. This one is not as easy for me as the Hardin Valley one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=10109)|
| 2:48:39| But, you know, I was involved in some things that happened back at the intersection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=10119)|
| 2:48:44| You know, TDOT spent a ton of money at this intersection, just south of this piece of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=10124)|
| 2:48:49| property. Turn lanes, new intersection improvements, realigned a bunch of stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=10129)|
| 2:48:54| That is a hot residential market because that new school out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=10134)|
| 2:49:01| I think it's a fantastic area to grow up in and live in. And I think there's a lot of services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=10141)|
| 2:49:07| that are coming out there. I think they'll get more services as they get a few more houses out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=10147)|
| 2:49:13| there. I think it is certainly appropriate with sewer to look at a sector plan change. I would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=10153)|
| 2:49:20| lean towards a rural residential sector plan change here because of the applicant's willingness| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=10160)|
| 2:49:29| to come down to the two per the acre. And I think that would be a good transitional buffer in between| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=10169)|
| 2:49:34| things between the LDR and this particular piece. So I would make a motion that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=10174)|
| 2:49:40| change the sector plan from agricultural to rural residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=10180)|
| 2:49:45| Thank you, Commissioner. All right. We have a motion and a second. Motion by Commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=10185)|
| 2:49:51| Hood, second by Commissioner Browning to change the sector plan to rural residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=10191)|
| 2:49:56| And my reason for that, Commissioner, would be, you know, the same thing I said at Hardin Valley,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=10196)|
| 2:50:02| you know, the changing conditions out there, new utilities and improvements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=10202)|
| 2:50:07| and certainly in the new school. Thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=10207)|
| 2:50:10| Chair recognizes Commissioner Roth. Oh, I'm sorry, Pat. I was going to make a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=10210)|
| 2:50:18| Chris did, so I need to take my hat off. Thank you. Commissioner Korbelik.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=10218)|
| 2:50:25| I just want to point out as an observation that every time we amend a sector plan, especially in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=10225)|
| 2:50:33| the rural growth area, we are shortchanging the planning process in two ways. One is that we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=10233)|

| 3:06:14| any chance or? I don't think you can control the screen. Okay. We were approached. You see the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=11174)|
| 3:06:19| cursor on the screen? I do. If you go over closer to that, that's where we are. You were just there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=11179)|
| 3:06:26| this middle plot. Regardless, we were approached a couple months ago by someone to purchase our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=11186)|
| 3:06:31| home because they were going to be building an industrial center across the street from us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=11191)|
| 3:06:36| And my concern is that we've never really been told exactly how it's going to impact our property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=11196)|
| 3:06:43| We purchased the place about three years ago. We have animals. We have pigs, alpacas, chickens,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=11203)|
| 3:06:49| rabbits. We have a little homestead here that we've made plans for. And I'm nervous about how| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=11209)|
| 3:06:56| this rezoning is going to impact our land. And actually from your planning website, when I looked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=11216)|
| 3:07:03| at what the industrial will do, it says, this zone provides areas in which the principal use of land| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=11223)|
| 3:07:09| is for manufacturing, assembling, fabrication, and for warehousing and other uses, which have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=11229)|
| 3:07:14| heavy impacts and adverse effects on the surrounding property. These uses do not depend| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=11234)|
| 3:07:19| primarily on frequent personal visits. So that part's not important. My issue is, how is this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=11239)|
| 3:07:26| going to impact our ability to have our homestead here? Is this going to change our ability to have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=11246)|
| 3:07:32| our animals or add animals in the future if we decide to grow? And of course, what this is going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=11252)|
| 3:07:38| to do to my property values if we decided to sell this location at some point? Any other? Is that it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=11258)|
| 3:07:49| Thank you. Mr. Grissom, would you like to explain your project?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=11269)|
| 3:07:58| Yes. At this time, we're just submitting for rezoning. And we will adhere once, I guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=11278)|
| 3:08:04| progress is done. We will adhere to any landscaping buffers per city requirements and zoning codes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=11284)|
| 3:08:12| And I can't speak for the evaluation of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=11292)|
| 3:08:20| Thank you. What about, is this going to change any of the zoning where I'm at and keep me from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=11300)|
| 3:08:27| being able to have animals? Your property is not included in any rezoning. So whatever the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=11307)|
| 3:08:34| is currently zoned, we'll continue that right now. It shouldn't affect your property. I will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=11314)|
| 3:08:40| let staff, Liz, you want to address Mr. Crocker's comments? Yes. The parcels as advertised and on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=11320)|
| 3:08:51| the applications are the only ones being considered for a rezoning that would permit a change in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=11331)|
| 3:08:59| type of land uses permitted at that site. The surrounding properties, their zoning is not being| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=11339)|
| 3:09:06| impacted. Mr. Crocker, do you have any other comments you'd like to make? I do not. My wife may.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=11346)|
| 3:09:28| Thank you. Chair recognizes Commissioner Scott Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=11368)|
| 3:09:32| Yeah, I want to apologize for making that motion too soon. I didn't realize that Mr. Crocker was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=11372)|
| 3:09:38| there to speak. So obviously, we'll pull that back until we resolve this to his satisfaction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=11378)|
| 3:09:43| and get consensus. But is there any kind of buffering or tree, vegetative buffers that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=11383)|
| 3:09:51| are required in this zone that would offer the protection to the, I guess it's the LDR area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=11391)|
| 3:09:58| that he lives in between these uses and that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=11398)|
| 3:10:09| Yeah, sorry, I keep having this problem unmuting myself. Yes, they will be required to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=11409)|
| 3:10:16| buffering and landscaping between the industrial uses and the residential uses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=11416)|
| 3:10:21| as required by the City of Knoxville Zoning Ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=11421)|
| 3:10:29| Okay. And I think he's on parcel 38. Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=11429)|
| 3:10:36| Yeah, I had it here. Yes, I am. 068038. That's what parcel ID we are. Yep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=11436)|
| 3:10:44| Okay. Now, the one we're talking about now is the part that doesn't really touch your property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=11444)|
| 3:10:51| I think. Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=11451)|
| 3:10:58| Well, we go, it's going to cover this back part of the property. We're concerned more about the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=11458)|
| 3:11:03| front part if you go to the other side across the Keck Street. We're also concerned about the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=11463)|
| 3:11:07| traffic. So, I know my wife had wanted to comment on here as well. Her concern was that our road is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=11467)|
| 3:11:14| a very narrow road. Oftentimes, traffic going one way or the other will have to pull off into| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=11474)|
| 3:11:20| someone's grass to let another truck go through or another car go through even. We're concerned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=11480)|
| 3:11:26| about what's this going to do to traffic? Are we going to have potentially semi-trucks, delivery| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=11486)|
| 3:11:31| vehicles? What sorts of traffic is going to be on the road where it's already difficult| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=11491)|
| 3:11:36| to pass another person on this single road? And how is that going to impact us if they have to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=11496)|
| 3:11:41| widen the road? Maybe the applicant can answer that. I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=11501)|
| 3:11:54| Liz, will Keck Road be utilized for access?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=11514)|
| 3:11:57| So, it's my understanding that the applicant is proposing a new road. Staff has noted that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=11517)|
| 3:12:07| They're also on this same agenda for concept plan review for a new road accessing the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=11527)|
| 3:12:17| Mr. Grissom should be able to speak to that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=11537)|
| 3:12:26| There has been an approved concept plan through the-| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=11546)|
| 3:12:32| It does not include Keck Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=11552)|
| 3:12:34| It does not include Keck Road improvements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=11554)|
| 3:12:36| A traffic impact study would be provided for any future improvements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=11556)|
| 3:12:40| Yeah, and then I do have a traffic engineer in here that the traffic impact study will be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=11560)|
| 3:12:45| provided for any future improvements if they are needed or warranted. And they will go through the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=11565)|
| 3:12:50| city of Knoxville as well. Liz, could we show that alignment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=11570)|
| 3:12:58| where it comes in off of Callahan? Yes, if we could get-| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=11578)|
| 3:13:08| Nick could open up the concept plan for case 4 SF21-C.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=11588)|
| 3:13:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=11601)|
| 3:13:32| Can you see that improvement that's coming in off of Callahan Drive into the site?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=11612)|
| 3:13:43| Yes. Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=11623)|
| 3:13:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=11624)|
| 3:13:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=11626)|
| 3:13:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=11628)|
| 3:13:52| Can we have some information on what they're actually planning to develop there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=11632)|
| 3:13:55| Because another concern, the UPS distribution center is about a half a mile from us across| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=11635)|
| 3:14:02| that field. And they've been tearing down to expand here in the last couple weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=11642)|
| 3:14:07| And it's been causing quite a bit of noise. My office hours are 10 a.m. to 6 p.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=11647)|
| 3:14:13| Don't usually get up super early in the morning. But we've been dealing with a lot of noise while| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=11653)|
| 3:14:17| they're tearing that down. I understand that that is a temporary inconvenience while they're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=11657)|
| 3:14:21| building. But I'd like to know, do I have some sort of a loading warehouse that's going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=11661)|
| 3:14:25| suddenly be across the street from me and we're going to be dealing with vehicles and loading| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=11665)|
| 3:14:31| at all hours of the day or night?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=11671)|
| 3:14:33| This is, I will let the applicant respond to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=11673)|
| 3:14:44| Yeah. So any proposed developments at this time have not been determined.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=11684)|
| 3:14:50| Okay. And I'll just kind of refer back to the very beginning of this call when all this stuff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=11690)|
| 3:14:54| started at 1.30. I know that developers probably under no obligation to really take the time to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=11694)|
| 3:14:59| talk to us. But the bank and the park situation, it sounds like they had had some conversations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=11699)|
| 3:15:04| with the developer a few times to at least kind of get an understanding of what was happening in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=11704)|
| 3:15:08| their neighborhood. And I personally, and I'm not speaking specifically for any of my neighbors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=11708)|
| 3:15:15| but I suspected kind of like a little more information if that's ever forthcoming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=11715)|
| 3:15:23| This is Mike Reynolds with the Planning Office. I reviewed the concept plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=11723)|
| 3:15:27| that we just saw. In their traffic impact study that was submitted by the applicant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=11727)|
| 3:15:33| they described the project as having 575,000 square feet of warehousing and distribution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=11733)|
| 3:15:39| development. Of course, that doesn't mean that that's ultimately what's going to be there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=11739)|
| 3:15:44| but that is what their traffic impact study was using as a basis to determine the traffic that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=11744)|
| 3:15:50| this development would generate. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=11750)|
| 3:16:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=11762)|
| 3:16:08| I do want to point, it is the intent that the developer will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=11768)|
| 3:16:11| communicate with adjacent residents in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=11771)|
| 3:16:21| Thank you. I don't really have anything else to add. I appreciate everyone's time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=11781)|
| 3:16:24| Thank you. Thank you all. Commissioner Korbelick, you have a question, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=11784)|
| 3:16:29| Yes, this segues into my question, which is, with any reason, we have to look at all the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=11789)|
| 3:16:35| permitted uses. And I was wondering, what are the, what is the nature of the potential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=11795)|
| 3:16:41| off-site impacts, given the different uses provided in that zone? Smell, noise, lighting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=11801)|
| 3:16:50| et cetera. Can any of the staff address what the off-site impacts might be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=11810)|
| 3:17:02| Sorry, this is, excuse me, this is Liz. So the City of Knoxville Zoning Ordinance has some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=11822)|
| 3:17:09| performance standards that are required for various uses. Let me see which section that's in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=11829)|
| 3:17:20| So there are definitely provisions related to noise, light, vibration,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=11840)|
| 3:17:29| smells, dust. Hang on just one second. Let me see which section it's in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=11849)|
| 3:17:43| Liz, it's in section 10.5. Thank you. Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=11863)|
| 3:17:49| Just more specifically, if I may, I guess my question is, at the point where the impact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=11869)|
| 3:17:57| might cross the boundary onto a residential land, is there a general provision that it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=11877)|
| 3:18:04| not be greater than what a normal residential development would have?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=11884)|
| 3:18:10| Ms. Corbo, too, you were asking that question, too. Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=11890)|
| 3:18:27| So all uses, regardless of the type of use, have to comply with these environmental performance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=11907)|
| 3:18:36| standard, as Director Brooks noted, under 10.5. So even, you know, if it's development of a new| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=11916)|
| 3:18:46| residential subdivision, they would have to comply with these noise and vibration and dust and air| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=11926)|
| 3:18:52| pollution standards. You know, it is adjacent to some existing industrial zoned property and near| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=11932)|
| 3:19:02| interstate interchange. So I, you know, believe that this is in line with what is occurring in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=11942)|
| 3:19:11| this area currently. Thank you, Ms. Corbo. Like there's also exterior lighting standards in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=11951)|
| 3:19:18| code as well in that same section, 10.2. And so all non-residential uses would have to or would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=11958)|
| 3:19:24| be required to submit a lighting plan to the city's Plans Review and Inspection Department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=11964)|
| 3:19:30| at the time of permitting. Thank you, Ms. Brooks. Ms. Albertson, we do have another speaker would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=11970)|
| 3:19:36| like to address the Commission. Mr. Moore. Yes. Your name and address, please. My name is Barry| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=11976)|
| 3:19:43| Moore. I live at 6411 Keck Road. Rob is my neighbor. And I've been living here for 34, 35 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=11983)|
| 3:19:53| I bought this house when I was 27 years old. I love this house. This is a quiet neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=11993)|
| 3:20:00| It's very nice and peaceful. There is some, Keck Road is narrow. And this was originally,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=12000)|
| 3:20:09| I think this is all zoned agricultural, commercial and forestry. It seems to me like a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=12009)|
| 3:20:17| jump to industrial is quite a big leap. There was a representative from the company come to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=12017)|
| 3:20:27| our house and made an offer on our house, which wasn't comfortable enough for me to go into| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=12027)|
| 3:20:33| homelessness. They showed me a site plan. And from what I've heard so far of this meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=12033)|
| 3:20:44| the answers about noise and barriers and buffer zones is still a little bit vague. I haven't heard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=12044)|
| 3:20:52| anything specific as to what exactly I can expect in the future. So that bothers me quite a bit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=12052)|
| 3:21:02| because I haven't got any specific answers to my questions about barriers. The four words I have to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=12062)|
| 3:21:10| say to the developer, and I believe it's E&J, is welcome to the neighborhood. I hope that you're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=12070)|
| 3:21:15| successful. And I hope that we can all live here together. You won't get an argument out of me or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=12075)|
| 3:21:21| fight out of me. But I am concerned about noise and impact. And I don't intend to move. I want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=12081)|
| 3:21:27| to live here just like some of the other people here until I expire. I would like to say this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=12087)|
| 3:21:34| that not just me, I live at, I think it's 36. And of the three houses there that are that are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=12094)|
| 3:21:41| closest to it, I'm the least affected. Now, however, 39, and I believe across the street, I think it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=12101)|
| 3:21:48| a 13. There are some ladies that live here that have lived here much longer than I have. And we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=12108)|
| 3:21:57| were here first. And these ladies are by themselves or with a son. And they're closer to the impact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=12117)|
| 3:22:07| than I am. And I'm very concerned about them, about how much noise and dust. And to have a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=12127)|
| 3:22:16| facility, a manufacturing facility or a warehousing facility, there are things like air compressors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=12136)|
| 3:22:23| there are banging and metal bores and lighting and everything that you've mentioned here in this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=12143)|
| 3:22:29| meeting. And it concerns me about how close they are and what kind of a, exactly what kind of a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=12149)|
| 3:22:37| buffer. I'd like to live here and not know of them being there. And that's, that's what I'd like. And| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=12157)|
| 3:22:43| I'd like to say that just about, I wouldn't expect anything less than anyone on the commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=12163)|
| 3:22:48| if they were going to build a factory like that close to your house, I'd say you'd probably feel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=12168)|
| 3:22:53| the same way. Rob is a great neighbor. He's got some beautiful animals at his house. And I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=12173)|
| 3:22:59| that he ought to be able to do what he wants to at his house and live in peace. And I think that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=12179)|
| 3:23:04| the person that bought this or the entity that bought this property, I believe in capitalism| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=12184)|
| 3:23:10| and the American dream. And I hope that they're successful and very profitable and have a great| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=12190)|
| 3:23:15| future here. But if they come in here and they build something, I think a little bit of what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=12195)|
| 3:23:22| we used to see in the Andy Griffith episodes, they should come here to my house and tell me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=12202)|
| 3:23:29| specifically what I'm going to have to encounter as far as noise, as far as light, as far as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=12209)|
| 3:23:36| buffer. And I believe me, I would help them in any way whatsoever. And we all live here peacefully.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=12216)|
| 3:23:44| But that's my point is that it's just I haven't gotten any specifics. They have not called a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=12224)|
| 3:23:52| meeting. They've not come down here, knocked on our doors and say, we're going to go down here to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=12232)|
| 3:23:56| the gathering place at a church or a civic building. And we're going to lay it out. We're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=12236)|
| 3:24:04| going to put our plans right here in front of you. This is what we want to do. And this is what we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=12244)|
| 3:24:08| going to do to protect you and your interests. And like I said, we were here first. But then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=12248)|
| 3:24:17| again, what you people said about the zoning, about the UPS and the interstate and the exit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=12257)|
| 3:24:24| it is handy for industrial use. The location on the other side where the interstate is at,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=12264)|
| 3:24:32| it is a facility-orientated environment. But back here on our side,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=12272)|
| 3:24:39| it's not. And I would really like to know specifically, suppose they put a facility in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=12279)|
| 3:24:46| here, me and Rob and Mr. Charrett and Peggy, how much noise and how much inconvenience are we going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=12286)|
| 3:24:52| to have to put up with before we can actually do something to change it? I mean, what are our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=12292)|
| 3:24:58| rights? That's what I want to know. Can you hear me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=12298)|
| 3:25:05| Yes, we can hear you. Okay. Okay. And you ask a lot of good questions. And let me say that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=12305)|
| 3:25:11| Mr. Moore, Mr. Crocker, we hear a lot of comments from the public about development. And I want to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=12311)|
| 3:25:19| applaud both of you for coming in here and being very courteous, sharing your stories about your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=12319)|
| 3:25:26| property. And but, you know, we understand what you're saying. I don't have an immediate answer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=12326)|
| 3:25:36| for you, to be honest with you. I mean, you know, we don't right now, it's, I would say the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=12336)|
| 3:25:41| developer is looking at getting it rezoned, and then building what they need to in order to make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=12341)|
| 3:25:48| the project work. And as long as it complies with the zoning requirements, we're limited,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=12348)|
| 3:25:56| and the city is limited. Excuse me, pardon me. I didn't interrupt you right there, is that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=12356)|
| 3:26:06| I haven't gotten any specifics yet. And I don't, in my opinion, I don't think that anything should| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=12366)|
| 3:26:12| be approved until we do have specifics, as far as how well we're going to be treated on this end| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=12372)|
| 3:26:20| of the deal. And, and like I said, it's they bought it, and they should be able to do what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=12380)|
| 3:26:27| they darn well please with it and go with it. But however, it's right here in our front yard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=12387)|
| 3:26:35| And I think that they should come here and tell me, truthfully and honestly, point blank,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=12395)|
| 3:26:43| this is what's going to be, this is what we're planning on. Now, they did, I saw on one of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=12403)|
| 3:26:48| plans that they were planning on making Keck Road a dead end, passes Mrs. Sheridan's house,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=12408)|
| 3:26:54| Mrs. Sheridan's house. And there's always a silver lining. I would love to see Keck Road as a dead| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=12414)|
| 3:27:01| end, because we've got a nice collection of rednecks down here that drive on that road 90 to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=12421)|
| 3:27:07| nothing. And a dead end would really be enhancing to keep and it would make it a lot quieter as far| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=12427)|
| 3:27:14| as traffic's concerned. So I mean, you know, it's always a plus and a minus. But really, I do, I say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=12434)|
| 3:27:22| welcome to the neighborhood. I hope that, but I just really hope that whoever it is that they're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=12442)|
| 3:27:30| back their buildings off and put a, I would put cedar trees, I would put a lot of cedar trees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=12450)|
| 3:27:37| between me and, you know, a good neighbor. That's what I'm looking for is a good neighbor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=12457)|
| 3:27:44| That's, that's, that's what, go ahead. Yeah, thank you, Mr. Martin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=12464)|
| 3:27:49| I want to recognize Ms. Tracy Crocker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=12469)|
| 3:27:52| Hi, my name is Tracy Crocker. I live at 6407 Keck Road. I'm only here to represent myself. My| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=12472)|
| 3:27:59| husband and I sometimes have differing opinions on things. And that's a beautiful thing for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=12479)|
| 3:28:05| I just want to reiterate that what my husband, Mr. Crocker and Mr. Moore have both said, we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=12485)|
| 3:28:14| really had a lack of information coming from the developer. We don't know what's going in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=12494)|
| 3:28:22| we don't know how it's going to impact us. And for us, the big thing is, again, we do have animals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=12502)|
| 3:28:29| So just for those of you who haven't been on a farm or been around animals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=12509)|
| 3:28:35| we have animals that we breed. In the process of breeding these animals, excessive dust,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=12515)|
| 3:28:42| excessive light, excessive noise impacts the amount of litter that they produce. It in fact,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=12522)|
| 3:28:51| affects the quality of the animals that are produced. So we really need to have that kind| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=12531)|
| 3:28:57| of information to know how is this going to affect our livelihood, because that is part of our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=12537)|
| 3:29:03| livelihood. Thank you. Mr. Reynolds, you have your hand up. Yes, thank you, Commissioner Phillips.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=12543)|
| 3:29:16| I just wanted to address the landscaping buffering that would be required. At least what's required| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=12556)|
| 3:29:25| as per the city's zoning ordinance, which is Article 12.8, buffer yards. Between a non-residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=12565)|
| 3:29:40| so a non-residential use, non-residential district abutting a residential district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=12580)|
| 3:29:46| sorry, let me get this right, requires a Class B buffer. So that would be the case here. We got,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=12586)|
| 3:29:51| you know, industrial zone about a residential zone. A Class B buffer yard is 20 feet wide and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=12591)|
| 3:29:57| in that 20-foot buffer, there's trees and bushes and so on that need to be installed there. So it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=12597)|
| 3:30:03| should create a fairly good landscape buffer between two uses. But what I want to point out here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=12603)|
| 3:30:12| is that this is for properties that abut each other and properties that abut each other are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=12612)|
| 3:30:20| physically touching, they're not across the street. So in this case, since their industrial property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=12620)|
| 3:30:28| goes up to Keck Road, the properties across the street are not abutting it. So it's not abutting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=12628)|
| 3:30:33| a residential property, the properties across the street. So the landscape buffer would only apply| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=12633)|
| 3:30:41| to the properties, you know, if we're looking at this section of Keck Road, it'd be properties to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=12641)|
| 3:30:48| the west of the industrial piece on the north side of Keck Road. That's where the buffering would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=12648)|
| 3:30:53| apply and not to the other properties. I would like to point out that that industrial zone goes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=12653)|
| 3:31:00| all the way around behind our property too. So it's not just in front of us, it is also behind us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=12660)|
| 3:31:08| And that's what Mr. Reynolds is saying, that the buffer landscape would be on the sides of 39| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=12668)|
| 3:31:18| and the backs of parcels 39, 38 and 37. Is that correct, Mr. Reynolds? That's right. And it would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=12678)|
| 3:31:25| also be, you know, on the north side of Keck Road, those properties, but industrial zone as shown| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=12685)|
| 3:31:32| on the screen there. 13 and 1404. Yeah, yeah. If I could just intercede for just a second here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=12692)|
| 3:31:38| that's all good and well, but that's almost ironically exactly where we don't need it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=12698)|
| 3:31:43| The buffer would need to be in the front, you know, having it to the back of our house,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=12703)|
| 3:31:48| there's already woods back there. That's not a big deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=12708)|
| 3:31:54| Directly across the street, that's where we're going to be staring every day when we come home,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=12714)|
| 3:31:58| that's where we're going to be when we're out on our front porch. We've got bedrooms facing that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=12718)|
| 3:32:05| property. If there's lights, we're going to have a bunch of light pollution. Those are the areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=12725)|
| 3:32:09| that we're concerned about. So, I mean, I understand what everybody's pointing out here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=12729)|
| 3:32:14| but the letter of the law doesn't really impact the reality of the fact that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=12734)|
| 3:32:19| it's not going to change anything for us if they plant trees back there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=12739)|
| 3:32:23| Commissioner, do you have anything? You know, I would suggest at this time, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=12743)|
| 3:32:29| there are a lot of good questions. These residents are going to be impacted and the developer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=12749)|
| 3:32:36| doesn't have specifics at this time. You know, I would suggest we look at maybe postponing this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=12756)|
| 3:32:41| but Mr. Grissom, you had your hand up and we need to get moving. It's after five o'clock and we've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=12761)|
| 3:32:49| still got a number of items to go through. Yes, I just wanted to point that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=12769)|
| 3:32:55| this is the first stage is rezoning and we have every intent. I represent the owner. There is not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=12775)|
| 3:33:01| a developer in place. We have to prepare the property to then see about development in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=12781)|
| 3:33:08| future. This is the first stage. We will adhere to all city and county buffers, landscaping,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=12788)|
| 3:33:15| what's been required. If you dive into the details of what Mike has already presented,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=12795)|
| 3:33:19| not just the landscaping buffers that are required, but we have the noise, the lighting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=12799)|
| 3:33:24| everything that from my experience that we've had to adhere to on very similar| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=12804)|
| 3:33:30| types of developments and stuff. We will and are required to adhere to all of those zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=12810)|
| 3:33:38| ordinances and we'll do so. I'm going to recognize Commissioner Roth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=12818)|
| 3:33:49| There are a lot of questions and even on commission, even with the commissioners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=12829)|
| 3:33:57| I think in this case, you may find it not even my intent is to ask for the make a motion that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=12837)|
| 3:34:03| we postpone this for 30 days and allow some of those questions to be answered off meeting time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=12843)|
| 3:34:12| because I don't think we can answer them all here in any reasonable amount of time. So we'll make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=12852)|
| 3:34:17| a motion to postpone for 30 days. I'd like to second that, Adams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=12857)|
| 3:34:21| We've got a motion by Commissioner Roth, seconded by Commissioner Adams to postpone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=12861)|
| 3:34:30| these items for 30 days. Call the roll, please, Ms. Cairn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=12870)|
| 3:34:38| Commissioner Uten? Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=12878)|
| 3:34:40| Mr. Eason? To clarify,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=12880)|
| 3:34:43| is this rezoning of parts A and B or is this just part B that rezoning?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=12883)|
| 3:34:51| I thought we already approved. I think we approved A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=12891)|
| 3:34:55| So this is just postponement of B.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=12895)|
| 3:35:00| Hang on. We postpone the one-year plan and the rezoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=12900)|
| 3:35:07| for 30 days. Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=12907)|
| 3:35:14| And Mr. Grissom, I would suggest that you might want to take some time out of your day and meet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=12914)|
| 3:35:19| with Mr. Crocker and Mr. Moore and see if you can't get them a little more comfortable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=12919)|
| 3:35:27| I will coordinate that over with the current owner and have that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=12927)|
| 3:35:37| Thank you. Mr. Crocker, Mr. Moore, let me just tell you, right now, we are in the plan and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=12937)|
| 3:35:43| rezoning phase. Where the shoe makes the pavement is when we get into the site plan and the actual| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=12943)|
| 3:35:53| permitting of the project. And that's when more specifics of the project come out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=12953)|
| 3:36:01| But maybe you all can get together with Mr. Grissom and talk and maybe he can answer some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=12961)|
| 3:36:07| more of your questions. Go ahead, Dory. Yes. Commissioner Uten voted aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=12967)|
| 3:36:15| Commissioner Eason? Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=12975)|
| 3:36:19| Commissioner Dent? Yes. And I just had a quick question to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=12979)|
| 3:36:24| Commissioner Phillips' point. Since we voted on consent for the road to be added as a concept| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=12984)|
| 3:36:32| plan, any future development of this piece would have to be passed through a concept plan as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=12992)|
| 3:36:37| correct? I can help answer that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=12997)|
| 3:36:43| The only time that they would need to submit a new concept plan is if they are doing more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=13003)|
| 3:36:50| lots than they originally requested or they extend that road that they propose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=13010)|
| 3:36:57| Most development that goes in, if they build the road as we saw in the concept plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=13017)|
| 3:37:03| do the number of lots that we saw, most uses in the industrial zone are permitted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=13023)|
| 3:37:08| There's probably just a few that would come through for special use to the planning commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=13028)|
| 3:37:11| So most things go straight through permitting. Got you. Okay. Thank you, Mike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=13031)|
| 3:37:21| Continue, Dory. Okay, thank you. And Commissioner Roth?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=13041)|
| 3:37:24| Yes. Yes. Commissioner Adams?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=13044)|
| 3:37:28| Yes. Commissioner Browning?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=13048)|
| 3:37:30| Yes. Commissioner Phillips?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=13050)|
| 3:37:32| Yes. Commissioner Korbelik?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=13052)|
| 3:37:36| Yes. Commissioner Scott Smith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=13056)|
| 3:37:38| Yes. Commissioner Boyer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=13058)|
| 3:37:40| Yes. Commissioner Hill?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=13060)|

| 3:39:32| option, some residents who are opposing this. Would you like to go first? Would you like the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=13172)|
| 3:39:37| opposition to go? I think that would be prudent if I go first simply because there's a lot of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=13177)|
| 3:39:42| misinformation that could probably dispense with some of the opposition that would maybe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=13182)|
| 3:39:48| based on something incorrect. So if you don't mind, I'll go first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=13188)|
| 3:39:50| All right. You're free to go. At the pre-agenda meeting two days ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=13190)|
| 3:39:55| Hanson Sale from the Association of Realtors spoke about the critical inventory shortages and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=13195)|
| 3:40:01| especially, you know, under $300,000 and the need for increased density and the problems of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=13201)|
| 3:40:06| hyperinflated construction costs and the need for creative ways to develop, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=13206)|
| 3:40:13| high-quality construction. And I'm very familiar with these issues, by the way. My company,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=13213)|
| 3:40:17| in addition to developing, I collect housing data from 117 counties. I've spoken about these issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=13217)|
| 3:40:23| at various homebuilders associations well over 200 times. So this is in my wheelhouse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=13223)|
| 3:40:29| I also noticed in that meeting two days ago that Commissioner Krabelic spoke about the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=13229)|
| 3:40:34| public health issues and the need for common area things like trails and playgrounds and aesthetics| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=13234)|
| 3:40:40| and avoiding the idea of cramming as many people as possible into the smallest space possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=13240)|
| 3:40:46| So I'm completely aware of that. I found this site by searching for parcels along the bike trail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=13246)|
| 3:40:53| I simply was searching up and down the bike trail looking for some public, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=13253)|
| 3:40:56| transportation, if you will. And this site has the added bonus of being near the park| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=13256)|
| 3:41:00| and near the trailhead. And there's Walker Springs Park directed to the south of here as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=13260)|
| 3:41:05| I wrote a summary of this development plan. I presented that to the neighbors that were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=13265)|
| 3:41:10| directly across the street. I believe one or two houses past that and then the two homes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=13270)|
| 3:41:15| that were directly to my south. And so in total, I think I delivered seven of those packages there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=13275)|
| 3:41:21| I believe even and I had a chance to do that just a couple of days ago. I've not been able to get it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=13281)|
| 3:41:27| done a little sooner than I hope. But regardless, there's some misinformation about the belief that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=13287)|
| 3:41:32| I'm trying to build apartments and that's not the case. So what I like to do is tell you what I do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=13292)|
| 3:41:36| plan to build. And the NPC commissioner should have or the NPC staff certainly has the proposal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=13296)|
| 3:41:42| that I sent to the homeowners. I considered four types of construction when I was looking at this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=13302)|
| 3:41:47| site. The site has some challenges. It's just below grade a little bit. It's heavily, heavily| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=13307)|
| 3:41:51| wooded. There is a drainage easement that goes across or drainage that goes across the back of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=13311)|
| 3:41:56| the property. There's also a gas line that runs parallel to the property, parallel to East| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=13316)|
| 3:42:02| Meadcrest Drive. And there's also a gas line on the very south side of the property that runs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=13322)|
| 3:42:10| east and west toward Walker Springs apartment. So all those factors combined and just looking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=13330)|
| 3:42:15| at this analysis, and I believe there's four types of construction. There's single-family homes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=13335)|
| 3:42:20| there's detached villas, there's attached units, you know, condos and there's apartments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=13340)|
| 3:42:25| And I think the best use of the property is the detached villa homes. I look at single-family,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=13345)|
| 3:42:31| but the math simply doesn't work. The construction cost and retail base of $200 a square foot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=13351)|
| 3:42:36| If I try to build exactly what's across the street, it puts me in a price range of nearly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=13356)|
| 3:42:41| half a million dollars, which is not conducive to the neighborhood. I pulled the comps around| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=13361)|
| 3:42:45| the neighborhood. The most recent comp was 701 East Meadcrest, sold for $232,000 on November| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=13365)|
| 3:42:53| the 6th of 20. Prior to that, there was a sale in 19 and prior to that, a sale in 17. And those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=13373)|
| 3:42:59| values were just $168,500 and $150,000 respectively. But even if construction costs are not a factor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=13379)|
| 3:43:06| building single-family homes here doesn't make any sense because to do this, I would have to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=13386)|
| 3:43:10| clear-cut the property and then bring in a lot of dirt to bring it up to grade. And the single| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=13390)|
| 3:43:15| biggest asset this property has is the trees. And I'm trying to maintain the trees in order to not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=13395)|
| 3:43:21| just destroy the property. And that's unfortunately what the homeowners think I'm trying to do is just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=13401)|
| 3:43:25| go in there and just, you know, build apartments, tear it all down. And that's not what I'm doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=13405)|
| 3:43:29| at all. I believe that the type of construction I'm proposing accomplishes the goals we're talking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=13409)|
| 3:43:35| about. It's quote-unquote good development for a couple of reasons. I want to do detached villas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=13415)|
| 3:43:42| It avoids the mortgage issues that Commissioner Browning talked about in the pre-agenda meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=13422)|
| 3:43:47| with, you know, duplexes and triplexes being owned by multi-tenants or multi-homeowners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=13427)|
| 3:43:51| And more importantly, I think we've all learned in this pandemic that people don't want to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=13431)|
| 3:43:55| side-by-side. And so this separation provides privacy. And I think that what I'm doing is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=13435)|
| 3:44:01| a tremendous asset. It's a relatively older neighborhood. I found it curious that a couple| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=13441)|
| 3:44:06| of homeowners I talked to said, you know, there's homeless people that leave trash on this site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=13446)|
| 3:44:11| And yet I'm going to a neighborhood and the villa sells price to be in the neighborhood of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=13451)|
| 3:44:16| $240,000 to $250,000, which is above what I'm seeing so far as comp values. And I think that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=13456)|
| 3:44:23| certainly an improvement about what we have. I'll yield additional time to everyone else and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=13463)|
| 3:44:28| reply to the comments that I can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=13468)|

| 3:44:39| CHAIR BAILET Yes. There's four or five other people who'd like to speak on this particular| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=13479)|
| 3:44:46| item. So, you know, make your comments as direct as you can so it gives them the opportunity. But| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=13486)|

| 3:44:57| Meadcrest Drive. I live directly across from the property. We moved there in 1996. We understood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=13497)|
| 3:45:03| that this property across the street was a buffer between us and the apartments and that it wouldn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=13503)|
| 3:45:12| go away. It needed to be there for drainage. It needed to be there for the gas line that was going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=13512)|
| 3:45:17| across the front. The gas line, it goes across the front of a lot of the other houses all the way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=13517)|
| 3:45:21| down East Meadcrest as well. So that's why there's a grass buffer there. So nothing would be able to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=13521)|
| 3:45:26| be planted in that grass buffer as it is. There's a significant parking lot that would need to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=13526)|
| 3:45:35| placed at the front of the development. It will dump right into East Meadcrest. So what we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=13535)|
| 3:45:42| proposing here is to have a we've got a low density residential, obviously, single family| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=13542)|
| 3:45:47| homes that have been there for 40 to 50 years. And now we're going to have, you know, a number| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=13547)|
| 3:45:55| of the trees cut down. I'm going to have a view of the Walker Springs apartments. I don't doubt| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=13555)|
| 3:45:59| that. And that is a problem. That's going to lower my property values. So my investment has just lost| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=13559)|
| 3:46:06| money if this gets approved. And that's what the rest of the residents that we have talked to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=13566)|
| 3:46:13| along Shenley, along East Meadcrest, all feel the same way. It's going there's going to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=13573)|
| 3:46:20| impact harm done to the poor drainage that we already have. It's going to increase our traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=13580)|
| 3:46:27| Our traffic is not just our neighborhood. It's not just Crestwood Hills. We get a significant flow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=13587)|
| 3:46:33| of traffic from Walker Springs apartments. They come right around that corner and they go all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=13593)|
| 3:46:39| the way down East Meadcrest and then out to the interstate. Happens all the time. I have to wait| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=13599)|
| 3:46:44| in my driveway to get out. That wooded view is great right now. We didn't understand it was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=13604)|
| 3:46:52| privately held until just recently. So, you know, no one's talked to us about what the neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=13612)|
| 3:46:58| would like to do with it or anything like that, even though a former neighbor ended up owning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=13618)|
| 3:47:02| that land at one point in time. So I'll have a view of two medium density complexes when this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=13622)|
| 3:47:09| is all is done. And I don't want to look at one. I would not have purchased my house if I had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=13629)|
| 3:47:15| looked at Walker Springs apartments 25 years ago when I bought the property. I don't think that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=13635)|
| 3:47:21| this is compatible with the general plan of what the Planning Commission has stated in their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=13641)|
| 3:47:31| documents. I don't see how putting a medium density right up against a low density with the dump of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=13651)|
| 3:47:38| the traffic onto the low density neighborhood. I don't see where that the precedence has been set.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=13658)|
| 3:47:46| That's these are significant issues that I don't think are being addressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=13666)|
| 3:47:52| And I'll leave the top for everybody else. Thank you, Mr. McGrill. Mr. Blair, name and address,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=13672)|

| 3:49:09| is not in keeping with this community. It's very unusual. His development plan is very unusual and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=13749)|
| 3:49:20| does not appeal to the neighborhood or the conventional style of homes that are here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=13760)|
| 3:49:27| And also, I'm concerned with the possibility of a large parking lot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=13767)|
| 3:49:33| because there's going to be a lot of residents. If he goes through with his plans, there's going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=13773)|
| 3:49:38| to be a lot of people packed into that area with their cars in a parking lot that's going to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=13778)|
| 3:49:45| entering and exiting from our street, East Meadcrest Drive. And so that poses a serious,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=13785)|
| 3:49:53| dangerous traffic risk to us, the residents, because we use the street to walk our dogs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=13793)|
| 3:50:03| Mothers and two little boys were riding their bikes out front of my house yesterday. The| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=13803)|
| 3:50:08| neighborhood, we appreciate the fact that the people that live here have the same interests| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=13808)|
| 3:50:17| as we do. They're invested in their homes and their property. They're looking to live in a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=13817)|
| 3:50:22| subdivision that offers a nice yard with trees and streets where we can walk and recreate and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=13822)|
| 3:50:31| commune with our neighbors who share the same interests.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=13831)|
| 3:50:39| This project that Mr. Aikens plans, it's not compatible with this area, with this community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=13839)|
| 3:50:47| with East Meadcrest Drive. That's all I need to say. Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=13847)|
| 3:50:55| Thank you. Mr. Yarnell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=13855)|
| 3:50:59| Yes, and also I think Mr. Blair is available when I finish up. I think he sent a message out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=13859)|
| 3:51:06| 708 East Meadcrest, I own the home that is directly adjacent to the property to the south.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=13866)|
| 3:51:12| I'll go over three quick concerns, but the thing I want to point out is that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=13872)|
| 3:51:19| this is not an out parcel. This is land that is actually a part of the Crestwood Hills| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=13879)|
| 3:51:25| subdivision. It's land that is a part of the original development of the subdivision. It's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=13885)|
| 3:51:30| the equivalent of four lots, and you can tell that by looking at the homes directly across the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=13890)|
| 3:51:36| This property has been vacant since 1966 when my home was built,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=13896)|
| 3:51:41| and it's been vacant for a reason because it's virtually undevelopable. There's a pipeline that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=13901)|
| 3:51:48| runs along Meadcrest. There's a pipeline that runs perpendicular between my property and the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=13908)|
| 3:51:55| proposed development. This property is very much a wetlands property. It holds a lot of water. It| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=13915)|
| 3:52:03| acts as a buffer for drainage that's coming from the subdivision across Walker Springs Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=13923)|
| 3:52:09| There's several issues with this property. The first one that I really want to talk about is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=13929)|
| 3:52:14| the wetlands issue. I think everyone, surely everyone on commission understands the flooding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=13934)|
| 3:52:22| issues in Cedar Bluff, in the Cross Park Bridgewater area. The homeowners on Hardwick| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=13942)|
| 3:52:29| Drive, just downstream from us, one of those homes at the corner of Hardwick Drive and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=13949)|
| 3:52:35| Bridgewater Road has had to be razed many years ago because the flooding could not be controlled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=13955)|
| 3:52:41| I spoke with a homeowner on Hardwick Drive who's directly adjacent to the now empty lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=13961)|
| 3:52:47| He's had water in his basement several times over the last couple of years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=13967)|
| 3:52:52| The flooding issue is significant here. What we're proposing is not just turning a shovel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=13972)|
| 3:53:00| and paving and creating additional runoff, but what's being proposed here would remove a wetland| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=13980)|
| 3:53:07| area, 3.2 acres of land that now helps absorb water from upstream before passing it along.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=13987)|
| 3:53:15| There is not a very, there is not a significantly designated drainage area at the back of my| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=13995)|
| 3:53:21| property. I already have some flooding when it rains. Any additional runoff is going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=14001)|
| 3:53:28| create more flooding in my yard. It's easy to look at these projects one at a time and not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=14008)|
| 3:53:36| look at the bigger picture, but I think we have got to start looking at the bigger picture of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=14016)|
| 3:53:40| flooding in the Cedar Bluff Bridgewater area and the impact not only of developing and creating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=14020)|
| 3:53:46| runoff, but taking away a significant wetland area that already exists. And I think that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=14026)|
| 3:53:53| if I'm not mistaken, and I'm going to throw out a couple of questions that I hope one of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=14033)|
| 3:53:58| commissioners will ask the developer after we get done speaking because I do have a few questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=14038)|
| 3:54:04| One of the questions, one of the things I've been told is, is that the developer has recognized that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=14044)|
| 3:54:10| if he is able to build on this property, that he may have to build on stilts because of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=14050)|
| 3:54:16| flooding issues. Now, I don't know whether he'll admit to that or not, but that's something that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=14056)|
| 3:54:21| several of us have heard. The second issue is sewer. I spoke with West Knox Utility District| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=14061)|
| 3:54:29| yesterday to inquire about sewer because what we understand is, is that the developer has asked the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=14069)|
| 3:54:35| owners of Walker Springs Apartments to tie into their sewer line. There is a sewer line on Mead| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=14075)|
| 3:54:42| Crest across the street from the proposed property, but it's not believed that that's the normal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=14082)|
| 3:54:51| sewer line for the subdivision is able to be used because the proposed property is lower than the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=14091)|
| 3:54:57| sewer line. West Knox Utility District Engineering agreed with me that the sewer line across the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=14097)|
| 3:55:03| street is probably not usable. Again, probably one of the reasons the property wasn't developed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=14103)|
| 3:55:09| to begin with. That the proposed, the developer here has approached Walker Springs Apartments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=14109)|
| 3:55:17| and asked to tap into a sewer line on their property. It's my understanding that Walker| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=14117)|
| 3:55:22| Springs Apartments has not given permission for that yet, that that is still under advisement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=14122)|
| 3:55:28| on their part and that they are reluctant to agree to that because they already have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=14128)|
| 3:55:33| issues with that sewer line due to the capacity, that they already have problems with it and that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=14133)|
| 3:55:38| adding additional seats, additional restrooms and bedrooms to that existing sewer line| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=14138)|
| 3:55:46| could be catastrophic for their apartment residents. So the sewage there is an issue that I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=14146)|
| 3:55:52| don't think has been resolved. Mr. Yarnell, I hate to interrupt you, but we need to keep moving| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=14152)|
| 3:55:59| along and I think there are additional people that would like to speak. Y'all have gone well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=14159)|
| 3:56:05| past the five minutes that we normally allow. And but I will agree to additional time if the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=14165)|
| 3:56:13| commission is comfortable with that. I do have additional comments, but just a few.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=14173)|
| 3:56:19| Can you make them quick because I know that... Yes, just real quick. I would like one of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=14179)|
| 3:56:27| commissioners to ask the developer if he actually owns the property or if this is a contingency| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=14187)|
| 3:56:31| because a deed of transfer has not been registered on KGIS. So I don't know if he actually owns the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=14191)|
| 3:56:37| property. I'd like to know that. I'd like to have an answer about the stilt houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=14197)|
| 3:56:41| I'm very concerned about 10 acres or 10 units per acre. He's not proposing that on his drawing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=14201)|
| 3:56:47| He's proposing 12 units total, but he's asking for 10 units per acre. There's a significant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=14207)|
| 3:56:53| difference there. That's very concerning. And I just want to, you know, again, stress this is not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=14213)|
| 3:57:00| an out parcel. This is 475 feet deep into the subdivision. This is part of Crestwood Hill| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=14220)|
| 3:57:07| subdivision and not an outlying parcel. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Yarnell. Mr. Blair, real quick,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=14227)|
| 3:57:13| I mean, we need to move on. You're asking the wrong guy to go quick, Mr. Chairman. I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=14233)|
| 3:57:20| So a couple of things. First, I bought my house just when Kevin did in 1996.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=14240)|
| 3:57:26| But uniquely, I have lived here for the most of my life starting in 1973. I can tell you that on this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=14246)|
| 3:57:36| road, I grew up five houses up the street, which is why I bought my house here. In 1973, up until| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=14256)|
| 3:57:45| around 98, 99, our kids could ride their bikes. I could ride my bike. You could throw the football| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=14265)|
| 3:57:54| in the street. All that was great. When they widened the interstate, they decommissioned the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=14274)|
| 3:58:01| Walker Spring exit. They added the Walbrook exit and the Bridgewater on ramps and off ramps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=14281)|
| 3:58:08| They routed all traffic from Cedar Bluff through this subdivision down our road to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=14288)|
| 3:58:16| get people over to Walmart, to Galahard View area. The problem with that is when the roads open back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=14296)|
| 3:58:25| up, people realize this was still a shortcut. So the traffic on this road has tremendously| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=14305)|
| 3:58:33| increased to the point where we had to come before the county and get traffic calming devices| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=14313)|
| 3:58:40| installed. One of the things we looked at was actually making Meadcrest a dead end at Walker| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=14320)|
| 3:58:47| Springs. Instead, we have speed humps here, which only proved to make a ramp because I've had a car| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=14327)|
| 3:58:54| going so fast that it actually took out my mailbox and almost hit my son and I in our driveway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=14334)|
| 3:59:00| So the increase of traffic on this area, not to mention that we have bus stops at both ends| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=14340)|
| 3:59:07| right across from right at where they're proposing this, the fact that the driveway connection won't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=14347)|
| 3:59:14| be able to happen on Walker Springs because the distance between the road and the Walker| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=14354)|
| 3:59:18| Springs driveway won't work, so it will have to come out on Meadcrest. Additionally, what a lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=14358)|
| 3:59:24| of people won't know here, because I've been around a little longer, the flood area actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=14364)|
| 3:59:30| starts on the southeast corner of Woodbridge and Walker Springs, and the stormwater drain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=14370)|
| 3:59:39| actually goes under Walker Springs into this property. So to develop on this property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=14379)|
| 3:59:45| not only will you have to upset that flood issue, your building or buildings are going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=14385)|
| 3:59:54| to be back far enough from Meadcrest to get off the easement from Colonial Pipeline,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=14394)|
| 4:00:01| and then look at the additional traffic issues that are going to be created| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=14401)|
| 4:00:11| by these dwellings. Multifamily dwellings are not going to work at this location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=14411)|
| 4:00:17| If you wanted to build a couple of houses, I welcome you. Please, come on. I mean, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=14417)|
| 4:00:24| fit into the neighborhood. But between the issues that are outstanding here that I don't believe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=14424)|
| 4:00:31| have been looked at, the fact that Walker Springs has never been upgraded in the 48 years that I've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=14431)|
| 4:00:38| been involved with this subdivision and is looking at now even more traffic, with kids walking that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=14438)|
| 4:00:45| area with no sidewalks, I think you're talking about a huge safety issue. Again, a neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=14445)|
| 4:00:53| that needs to stay like a neighborhood. There are already 168 units of apartments or similar| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=14453)|
| 4:01:02| multifamily dwellings sitting immediately adjacent to this property right behind it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=14462)|
| 4:01:08| and over 1,000 within one mile of this property. This is not a need of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=14468)|
| 4:01:16| And Mr. Blair, I apologize. Go ahead. That's fine. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=14476)|
| 4:01:20| I'm sorry. But all right. We've got a couple of commissioners that have their hands raised and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=14480)|
| 4:01:27| I recognize Commissioner Scott Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=14487)|
| 4:01:29| Yeah, I was going to ask Dale Aiken. Hey, Dale. To me, the only issue here is compatibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=14489)|
| 4:01:39| You know, how compatible is what you want to do to the existing neighborhood?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=14499)|
| 4:01:43| And I'd like to get a better description of what kind of houses are going to be built here. Are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=14503)|
| 4:01:48| these going to be vertical, like units on top of each other? You know, the LDR current sector plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=14508)|
| 4:01:55| is up to five units an acre it would allow consideration of. I'm just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=14515)|
| 4:02:00| trying to understand what can we expect? Are these detached or are they attached or what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=14520)|
| 4:02:07| Can I speak? Yes, it's for you. Commissioner Smith, I'll try to address your question while| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=14527)|
| 4:02:12| I try to answer the questions from the gentleman that spoke before in opposition. I'll do these in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=14532)|
| 4:02:17| order. First, the reason I chose to do a peered construction, it's not a house on stilts like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=14537)|
| 4:02:23| you think of a pole barn or something. That's not what it is. The idea behind this is that I don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=14543)|
| 4:02:28| want to destroy the property. This property sits low in the back. It runs basically at the same| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=14548)|
| 4:02:33| grade as East Meadcrest Drive. So it falls from front to back. The entire reason to look at this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=14553)|
| 4:02:39| from the standpoint of globally as far as the flooding issue is because I don't want to go in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=14559)|
| 4:02:44| there and tear the property out with putting foundations in. If I did traditional construction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=14564)|
| 4:02:49| whether it's houses or a little higher density villas like I'm proposing, the traditional| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=14569)|
| 4:02:54| construction method is to dig footers around the entire perimeter of the property. And when you do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=14574)|
| 4:02:58| that, you tear up all the tree roots. And as a result, you lose all the trees. I had Nick Muth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=14578)|
| 4:03:03| from Chappella come over there. He's basically the guy that I use for tree cutting and also for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=14583)|
| 4:03:08| clearing property. He's a tree expert. There's several large black cherry trees in this property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=14588)|
| 4:03:13| we want to mark and save. And from my standpoint as a developer, I don't want to lose the trees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=14593)|
| 4:03:18| especially along the back, because those same trees shield me away from the apartments that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=14598)|
| 4:03:23| are directly behind me. So it wasn't that I have to build on stilts because of the flooding issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=14603)|
| 4:03:29| It's because I proposed that I want to have an engineered pier. I went to a company called| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=14609)|
| 4:03:33| Integration Engineering. I got in Todd Fugate and spoke to him about what it would cost to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=14613)|
| 4:03:38| It's a little more expensive. But what it does is it brings the building up above grade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=14618)|
| 4:03:43| It doesn't change. It has basically the lowest impact possible to change the detention| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=14623)|
| 4:03:48| basin. And it's not a flood, like a, what do you call it, not a floodplain, but a detention basin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=14628)|
| 4:03:55| And we want to maintain that detention basin as much as possible. In addition to that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=14635)|
| 4:03:59| we have to add detention on the site to hold water on our site that's impacted by our roof lines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=14639)|
| 4:04:04| So if anything, a development there that I'm doing is going to change the drainage in a better way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=14644)|
| 4:04:08| because right now it's just wide open. There's trash on the site. There's debris everywhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=14648)|
| 4:04:13| There's couches on the site. It's a landfill that needs to be cleaned up at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=14653)|
| 4:04:17| That's issue number one. Issue number two was I didn't go to Walker Springs Apartments and ask| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=14657)|
| 4:04:23| for a sewer connection, because that's the best thing to do. The easiest thing to do is to cut| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=14663)|
| 4:04:27| East Mead Crest Drive and go straight across. The sewers are across the street. I absolutely hate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=14667)|
| 4:04:32| cutting roads unless I have to, because it never, never gets back right. You know what I'm talking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=14672)|
| 4:04:36| about, the bump in the road that you never can fix. So what I did was I went to West Knox Utilities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=14676)|
| 4:04:41| and I asked them where the extension, and I asked for a sewer map. The extension of their sewer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=14681)|
| 4:04:46| currently is about two houses away from the corner of their property, basically. And as it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=14686)|
| 4:04:50| turns out, they have a sewer problem in one of their buildings called Building K, if memory serves| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=14690)|
| 4:04:55| me correctly. So I went to them and asked them for an easement, if I could extend the sewer line| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=14695)|
| 4:05:00| from West Knox Utilities up by two more manholes. And that would give them a newer connection,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=14700)|
| 4:05:05| it would give me a new connection, and it would avoid me having to cross the street. And I have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=14705)|
| 4:05:10| to cross a gas line as well. All those things are doable, but it's not the best option. It's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=14710)|
| 4:05:15| more expensive, again, but it's a better option. Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=14715)|
| 4:05:20| On the houses, are these going to have garages, or are they going to park under the house,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=14720)|
| 4:05:25| or be attached or detached with? This is all detached buildings. Do you guys,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=14725)|
| 4:05:30| does by chance, can NPC pull up the package I submitted by chance that shows the type of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=14730)|
| 4:05:34| construction? You know, just a second, before we get into that, let me say, we can see all the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=14734)|
| 4:05:41| plans in the world, but, you know, we can't hold the rezoning to a particular plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=14741)|
| 4:05:46| Right, right. I understand that. I mean, there's no point in looking at plans right now, because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=14746)|
| 4:05:51| those can change and probably will. Was it the front elevations? I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=14751)|
| 4:05:56| I mean, my issue is compatibility. I mean, 10 units an acre on a 1.6 acre site is just, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=14756)|
| 4:06:03| those people that live across the street, it's just kind of far away from what their deal is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=14763)|
| 4:06:10| And I was just trying to understand what you were doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=14770)|
| 4:06:12| According to the survey that I have, it's actually 1.67 acres. And the reason I asked for 10 units| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=14772)|
| 4:06:17| to the acre, if you do the calculations, if you take 1.67 acres times 10 units, that's 16 units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=14777)|
| 4:06:23| I'm proposing 12. The reason I'm asking for slightly more is because if a homeowner comes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=14783)|
| 4:06:27| to me and they ask me, I want to master the main plan. And I'm currently planning to do a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=14787)|
| 4:06:32| PUD development, which is, you know, individual lot lines. But if I have to do a condominium for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=14792)|
| 4:06:36| common area, and someone comes to me and says, I'd like to have a master in the main plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=14796)|
| 4:06:41| Well, if I need to split that unit so that I have an upstairs unit and a downstairs unit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=14801)|
| 4:06:45| that one unit now becomes two in the light of an NPC's eyes, because it's two units. It's the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=14805)|
| 4:06:51| number of doors they count, not the number of buildings. The site is only big enough to handle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=14811)|
| 4:06:55| these buildings, which is 20 foot wide and 35 feet long, I believe. And they're villa homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=14815)|
| 4:07:00| They're simply nice, consistent villa homes, two stories, and all the parking's in the front.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=14820)|
| 4:07:06| Okay, so no garages, but you'll have, how wide are your lots proposed to be, do you think?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=14826)|
| 4:07:10| Well, the units themselves are 20 feet wide. And what you do in this type of construction is you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=14830)|
| 4:07:14| have a centralized parking lot for one, for really two reasons. The biggest one being,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=14834)|
| 4:07:18| is you minimize how much land area you need to use as far as taking trees out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=14838)|
| 4:07:22| And secondly, you can build the units at that point on whatever grades you want them on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=14842)|
| 4:07:26| So for example, if the parking lot is on the same grade as these meat crests,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=14846)|
| 4:07:30| but we need to raise the unit up to five foot above grade in the back of the property or near| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=14850)|
| 4:07:34| the Walker Springs Apartments, it doesn't, the grade change doesn't require sidewalks because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=14854)|
| 4:07:39| you build a boardwalk from your parking lot over to your units, basically. And that way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=14859)|
| 4:07:43| you can leave as much of the tension area as possible. Okay, thank you. That's all I have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=14863)|
| 4:07:49| Thank you. Commissioners, I know several had their hands raised. I see they're down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=14869)|
| 4:07:54| Do y'all want to make a motion on this or do you want to postpone it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=14874)|
| 4:08:05| Commissioner Dent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=14885)|
| 4:08:11| I just wanted to make a comment that while I know we're not supposed to really look at land use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=14891)|
| 4:08:17| during rezoning, it appears from the attachment that the applicant sent that he has considered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=14897)|
| 4:08:25| every possibility of what can happen on this lot that's been vacant for decades. And it seems that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=14905)|
| 4:08:32| single family residences would actually do exactly what the opposition doesn't want, which is you're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=14912)|
| 4:08:38| going to change the grading of the land and you're going to force that water to have to go somewhere| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=14918)|
| 4:08:43| else. So I mean, I think I am in favor of this because it is consistent with the sector plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=14923)|
| 4:08:50| with medium density residential being next to it. So I'll let someone else make a motion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=14930)|
| 4:08:57| but I'm in favor of this. Do you recognize Commissioner Browning?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=14937)|
| 4:09:04| I'll second Commissioner Korbelik's motion. Wait a minute. I didn't hear a motion by Commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=14944)|
| 4:09:11| Korbelik. Did she make a motion? I didn't hear one. I was trying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=14951)|
| 4:09:19| The only hand I see raised right now is Commissioner Browning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=14959)|
| 4:09:24| I'm trying to make a motion, but I ran out of my, my mute stopped working, but I will,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=14964)|
| 4:09:31| I did want to make a motion to approve based on the staff recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=14971)|
| 4:09:38| And that is what I was seconding. I magically heard her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=14978)|
| 4:09:43| That's great. All right. So we got a motion and a second. Before we go to vote, Commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=14983)|
| 4:09:48| Browning. I was just going to say I'm in full agreement with Commissioner Dent. You know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=14988)|
| 4:09:57| this developer has really done exactly what we want developers to do. I mean, he is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=14997)|
| 4:10:04| this is a well thought out plan. He has actually gone to a number of homeowners, it looks like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=15004)|
| 4:10:10| and tried to talk to them about what he's doing. I don't know how much of a, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=15010)|
| 4:10:18| obviously hadn't gotten much, a very good welcome, you know, there, but, you know, from,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=15018)|
| 4:10:23| from the aspect of, you know, his overall plan, I think this property that truly is just, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=15023)|
| 4:10:30| if it truly is kind of like a landfill right now, it does seem like this, this solves a lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=15030)|
| 4:10:37| of issues for this particular piece of property. And it also kind of gives, you know, a, an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=15037)|
| 4:10:43| alternative form of housing that, you know, Commissioner Dent was talking about this past| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=15043)|
| 4:10:48| Tuesday, that, you know, is could possibly be a little bit more affordable, you know, for people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=15048)|
| 4:10:55| All right. We've got a motion and a second to approve the sector plan for staff's recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=15055)|
| 4:11:05| Call the roll, Dory. Yes. Commissioner Utton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=15065)|
| 4:11:12| I'm going to have a tough time on the density, but I'm going to go for the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=15072)|
| 4:11:17| Okay. Thank you. Commissioner Eddie Smith. Yes. Commissioner Eason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=15077)|

| 4:12:06| Thank you. That motion carries. Chair will entertain a motion to approve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=15126)|
| 4:12:11| the rezoning for staff recommendation. Eddie Smith, I'll make the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=15131)|
| 4:12:16| Is there a second? Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=15136)|
| 4:12:23| Lou, you're muted. Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=15143)|
| 4:12:28| All right. We have a motion by Commissioner Eddie Smith, second by Lou Browning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=15148)|
| 4:12:33| to approve the rezoning per staff's recommendation up to 10 dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=15153)|
| 4:12:39| Call the roll, Dory. Commissioner Utton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=15159)|
| 4:12:41| No. Commissioner Smith. Yes. Commissioner Eason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=15161)|
| 4:12:49| I had my hand up shortly to add a comment, so I'll add it right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=15169)|
| 4:12:55| I am concerned about the density. I am concerned about actually being able to preserve the trees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=15175)|
| 4:13:02| on the site as he has described being able to do. So I'll be looking at this very carefully| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=15182)|
| 4:13:08| with the planned residential review. Having said that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=15188)|
| 4:13:15| I'm going to vote no on the 10 dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=15195)|
| 4:13:21| Thank you. Commissioner Dent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=15201)|
| 4:13:25| Before I say, Commissioner Eason, what density would you be, you know, okay with? I'm just curious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=15205)|
| 4:13:33| I haven't really thought of that yet. It just seems okay. It just seems pretty,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=15213)|
| 4:13:39| the possibility of 10 seems very dense. Gotcha. I agree. I think the density is a bit much. I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=15219)|
| 4:13:47| know that they're looking for the flexibility depending on how the site actually, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=15227)|
| 4:13:51| plans out. But I think I'll go with no for now. Thank you. Commissioner Roth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=15231)|
| 4:13:56| Yes. Commissioner Adams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=15236)|
| 4:14:05| Yes. Commissioner Browning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=15245)|
| 4:14:08| Yes. Commissioner Phillips.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=15248)|
| 4:14:11| No. Commissioner Korbelek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=15251)|
| 4:14:16| I was going to ask Commissioner Browning what his concerns were with the requested density,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=15256)|
| 4:14:23| but I don't know if that's a question at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=15263)|
| 4:14:27| I didn't have a question about the density, Commissioner Korbelek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=15267)|
| 4:14:34| Oh, I'm sorry. I thought you had something. No, it might have been Commissioner Eason,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=15274)|
| 4:14:39| I think. I don't know. It was the one that had the issue with the density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=15279)|
| 4:14:47| Commissioners, we just need to vote. We don't need to be asking questions to everybody. Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=15287)|
| 4:14:52| Both. I had my hand up, but I'm going to vote yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=15292)|
| 4:14:56| Okay. Thank you. Commissioner Scott Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=15296)|
| 4:14:59| No. Commissioner Boyer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=15299)|
| 4:15:02| Yes. Commissioner Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=15302)|
| 4:15:04| Yes. Seven ayes, five nays.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=15304)|
| 4:15:10| And the motion carries. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=15310)|
| 4:15:12| We're on to agenda item number 22. This is a sector plan amendment and rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=15312)|
| 4:15:23| Staff is recommending postponement of this one for 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=15323)|
| 4:15:29| The applicant is Wilma Cardin, Robert Vaughn, location north side of Asheville Highway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=15329)|
| 4:15:36| due east of Cedar Ridge Road. Tract information is 1.78 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=15336)|
| 4:15:42| Present plan designation zoning is mixed-use special district A agriculture. Proposed plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=15342)|
| 4:15:49| designation zoning, office medical-related services. Staff recommendation is postponed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=15349)|
| 4:16:02| for 30 days to the May 13th meeting to allow more time to research and re-advertise addition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=15362)|
| 4:16:09| of recommended office zones to the Carter Town Center mixed-use special district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=15369)|
| 4:16:15| Second motion to postpone 30 days to the May 13th Planning Commission meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=15375)|
| 4:16:22| Is the applicant present? Ms. Cardin?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=15382)|
| 4:16:26| No. Mr. Vaughn's here. Wilma's my sister-in-law, and I represent her on all of her properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=15386)|
| 4:16:32| All right. Your name and address, and you have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=15392)|
| 4:16:38| And actually, is there any objections against it? I'd like to hear those first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=15398)|
| 4:16:46| Right now, we do not have anybody who's signed up to speak. There's Jennifer Pittsmore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=15406)|
| 4:16:53| Yeah, she's actually our tenant for the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=15413)|
| 4:16:57| Okay. All right. So, right now, we don't have any opposition. So, you're welcome to address| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=15417)|
| 4:17:05| the commission. Robert Vaughn, 1645 Bays Mountain Road, New Market, Tennessee, 37820.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=15425)|
| 4:17:14| The reason we're requesting the change is our tenant has a ministry, but they also offer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=15434)|
| 4:17:28| post-rehab treatment for and training for former addicts, and to give them skill sets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=15448)|
| 4:17:37| And they will eventually do — some people will reside there during that as a way to monitor them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=15457)|
| 4:17:45| and keep them on the program. That way, we're not finding them up under bridges. They're not finding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=15465)|
| 4:17:51| them wandering down the street homeless. And it's giving them skill sets to bring them back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=15471)|
| 4:17:58| into society. And unfortunately, I've seen it from the cartons driving that used to be there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=15478)|
| 4:18:09| seeing people come in late at night that have drug problems and stuff, and like to see it get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=15489)|
| 4:18:16| cleaned up and clean up the Carter community. And this is a first start because it's a church| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=15496)|
| 4:18:21| ministry as well as a skill set to bring them back into the community and to do some really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=15501)|
| 4:18:29| good work. And they are self-funded. They go raise their own funds so you don't have to worry about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=15509)|
| 4:18:36| them. And they train the people with skills that are usable. You know, talking about building homes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=15516)|
| 4:18:43| all day for the last four and a half hours. And some of the stuff they do is a lot of carpentry,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=15523)|
| 4:18:48| remodel and building. And that's the reason Wilma and I leased the property to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=15528)|
| 4:18:58| Thank you. Any other comments you'd like to make?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=15538)|
| 4:19:02| One last one is I've got Dreyer's right next door and another property we own| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=15542)|
| 4:19:06| that has been there for years. I don't even remember how many years they've been there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=15546)|
| 4:19:11| at least 10 if not 15 years. And it's a treatment facility as well, just physical instead of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=15551)|
| 4:19:23| substance and mental.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=15563)|
| 4:19:31| Jennifer Fitzmore or Jennifer Moore-Pitts, what is it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=15571)|
| 4:19:38| You need to unmute. We can't hear you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=15578)|
| 4:19:41| Can you hear me now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=15581)|
| 4:19:45| Yeah, can you get a little closer to your computer so we can hear you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=15585)|
| 4:19:52| Can you hear me now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=15592)|
| 4:19:53| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=15593)|
| 4:19:54| All right. Well, my name is Jennifer Moore-Pitts. The ministry that I founded is called Soul| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=15594)|
| 4:20:01| Savage Ministries. And we're a long-term faith-based discipleship program. We take people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=15601)|
| 4:20:08| in that are in recovery from any type of life-controlling issue, whether that's addiction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=15608)|
| 4:20:13| homelessness, depression, suicidal thoughts, anything that's hindering them from being| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=15613)|
| 4:20:17| productive members of society. And what we do, we have a discipleship program. I'm actually a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=15617)|
| 4:20:23| Teen Challenge graduate out of the one in Knoxville. I graduated 10 years ago and was very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=15623)|
| 4:20:28| successful in my life. And so we founded this last year and we bring people in and we walk them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=15628)|
| 4:20:33| through the same curriculum that Teen Challenge does. Then we also have a work division where we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=15633)|
| 4:20:38| have a handyman crew and we do vocational training through that. We teach them skills and ethics,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=15638)|
| 4:20:44| hopefully, that will help them to succeed long-term. The goal is to get these people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=15644)|
| 4:20:48| off of the streets and give them options to help them to actually learn to function with the PTSD| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=15648)|
| 4:20:55| and the trauma that they have, go through counseling and whatnot, and be able to actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=15655)|
| 4:21:00| have skills and be productive in caring for themselves before it's over with. We also have a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=15660)|
| 4:21:06| six-month to a year transition phase afterward. We have also put in a use on review, which is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=15666)|
| 4:21:13| number 36 on the agenda today as well, but they did say we needed to do two separate reviews.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=15673)|
| 4:21:19| That is also for housing. We operate as a ministry. I feel like that people hear recovery and they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=15679)|
| 4:21:26| get a little confused. We're non-medical, non-psychiatric. We do not detox people. We| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=15686)|
| 4:21:31| screen people very promptly. We do have insurance. We do not take sex offenders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=15691)|
| 4:21:36| And we have a strict accountability system. None of our students are allowed to go out without| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=15696)|
| 4:21:41| accountability. We work with the courts and the judicial systems a lot. A lot of them are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=15701)|
| 4:21:46| reporting to officers monthly and on very strict accountability as well. So I want the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=15706)|
| 4:21:53| to know that there's not any type of risk for them as far as our ministry. The bigger risk is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=15713)|
| 4:22:01| allowing these people to be untreated on the streets. We pass them on the street corners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=15721)|
| 4:22:07| holding signs and step over them when we go and get in our cars at the gas stations. So I just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=15727)|
| 4:22:12| want to make a difference. I want to have the opportunity to do that. And I appreciate you guys| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=15732)|
| 4:22:16| hearing this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=15736)|
| 4:22:17| CHAIRPERSON WEEKS Pull the record. Can you give us your address, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=15737)|
| 4:22:21| COMMISSIONER TAYLOR Yes, sir. I'm doing this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=15741)|
| 4:22:24| for 8535 Asheville Highway. My home address is 1707 Greenwell Drive in Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=15744)|
| 4:22:32| CHAIRPERSON WEEKS Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=15752)|
| 4:22:35| Chair will recognize Commissioner Hattie Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=15755)|
| 4:22:37| COMMISSIONER HATTIE SMITH Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And I never did hear,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=15757)|
| 4:22:41| maybe I just missed it. Is the applicant opposed to the postponement for 30 days?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=15761)|
| 4:22:45| COMMISSIONER HATTIE SMITH I would really like to get this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=15765)|
| 4:22:50| reviewed as soon as possible. I do have a student body of about 24 people. I also had a women's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=15770)|
| 4:22:57| division that I had to unfortunately close due to this process. So the sooner that we can come to a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=15777)|
| 4:23:03| decision, the better. But I do understand if you guys need to postpone it. But it would absolutely| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=15783)|
| 4:23:09| be a blessing today if we could come to some kind of resolve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=15789)|
| 4:23:13| COMMISSIONER TAYLOR I'm in agreeance on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=15793)|
| 4:23:17| CHAIRPERSON WEEKS Thank you. Chair will recognize| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=15797)|
| 4:23:21| Commissioner Hill. COMMISSIONER HILL| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=15801)|
| 4:23:23| Thank you, Chair Phillips. And, ma'am, I hear you loud and clear. What you said about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=15803)|
| 4:23:30| there are already there. There are many untreated. And these are folks that are seeking help,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=15810)|
| 4:23:36| want help. And we have a shortage of services. And what I would like to hear from staff is a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=15816)|
| 4:23:44| little more detail as to the concerns for the recommendation postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=15824)|
| 4:23:50| CHAIRPERSON WEEKS Would that be Liz or Amy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=15830)|
| 4:23:55| COMMISSIONER HATTIE SMITH I'm happy to answer. This is Liz.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=15835)|
| 4:23:59| So the East County Sector Plan, when it was adopted, it looked at the Carter Town Center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=15839)|
| 4:24:10| as a whole mixed-use area. The zone districts that it recommended included the town center zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=15850)|
| 4:24:20| the planned commercial zone. And I believe that was it. There were no office zones that were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=15860)|
| 4:24:28| explicitly permitted in that zone district, or sorry, in that land-use classification. However,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=15868)|
| 4:24:39| it's something that staff would like to look at for this entire Carter Town Center area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=15879)|
| 4:24:46| or maybe even just a small portion of it, say, from Andrew Johnson Highway over to this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=15886)|
| 4:24:52| intersection to allow consideration perhaps of the OB zone district, since that is the lesser| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=15892)|
| 4:25:01| intent of the office zone districts in the county. This also would allow us to look at the area more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=15901)|
| 4:25:07| comprehensively rather than just putting a dot of office as a land-use classification in this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=15907)|
| 4:25:16| It would potentially benefit multiple property owners in that area, as well as drive development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=15916)|
| 4:25:24| more to a town center area than down along a corridor. COMMISSIONER HATTIE SMITH| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=15924)|
| 4:25:32| Thank you. Any other comments from the Commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=15932)|
| 4:25:39| COMMISSIONER O'MARRA Yes, I had an additional question to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=15939)|
| 4:25:47| well, I don't know. My concern is that if we don't postpone it, if we act on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=15947)|
| 4:25:52| that down the line, they might be up and running, and then we would, there would be a person who| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=15952)|
| 4:25:58| might provide a legal challenge, and on the basis that the advertising wasn't complete and correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=15958)|
| 4:26:06| So I would be reluctant to proceed until I was quite sure that staff was entirely comfortable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=15966)|
| 4:26:13| with the way it was legally advertised.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=15973)|
| 4:26:16| COMMISSIONER HATTIE SMITH I concur with that. I totally respect the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=15976)|
| 4:26:21| desire for the applicant to move as quickly as possible, but I surely think that it would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=15981)|
| 4:26:27| worse if they got halfway down the road and we had other pickups.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=15987)|
| 4:26:31| COMMISSIONER HICKS What are we going to gain in 30 days? I mean, what's going to change?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=15991)|
| 4:26:35| It seems like we'll get clarity from staff standpoint on everything that's in their report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=15995)|
| 4:26:43| COMMISSIONER O'MARRA I would just like to clarify that we did| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=16003)|
| 4:26:47| advertise it as it's currently in your packet. So their request was advertised correctly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=16007)|
| 4:26:55| I think what, you know, what Liz was articulating was that the OB is not a zone that's considered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=16015)|
| 4:27:02| in the Mixed-Use Special District, and we're trying to get to a favorable recommendation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=16022)|
| 4:27:08| and we think the best thing to do is to align the current sector plan designation with the requested| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=16028)|
| 4:27:14| zoning. So we do think that office, in all likelihood, it is an appropriate use along here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=16034)|
| 4:27:21| and we think that it should be included in the Mixed-Use Special District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=16041)|
| 4:27:24| COMMISSIONER HATTIE SMITH So the staff recommendation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=16044)|
| 4:27:29| if they had made one, would have been favorable?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=16049)|
| 4:27:31| COMMISSIONER O'MARRA No, because it's not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=16051)|
| 4:27:34| it doesn't align with what's allowed in the sector plan designation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=16054)|
| 4:27:38| COMMISSIONER O'MARRA Could I make a comment? Do you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=16058)|
| 4:27:42| mind if I speak for a second? I just wanted to bring up the fact that the property directly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=16062)|
| 4:27:49| adjacent is zoned OB, which is the property that I'm going to be having a use on review for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=16069)|
| 4:27:56| which is number 36 on our agenda today. That property is zoned appropriate, and it's directly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=16076)|
| 4:28:02| next door, and we also operate as a church as well. Our housing, we can house our gentlemen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=16082)|
| 4:28:11| in the lower property that is zoned appropriately and just operate as a church and have our class| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=16091)|
| 4:28:18| in the property that is 8535 until our postponement, if you guys are willing to allow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=16098)|
| 4:28:23| us to do that. This will keep me from having to really send some of our participants home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=16103)|
| 4:28:28| We have 24 clients, and we're trying to, you know, we've purchased this property and have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=16108)|
| 4:28:33| been paying a lease on it for about four months, trying to resolve these issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=16113)|
| 4:28:38| and I do understand y'all's concerns. I'm willing to answer any questions that you have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=16118)|
| 4:28:42| I do understand that this is a different type of ministry and a different type of program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=16122)|
| 4:28:46| so I understand, and I want to make sure that everybody's clear on what we do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=16126)|
| 4:28:50| and what we offer and how we operate, but I just don't want to have to send more people home,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=16130)|
| 4:28:55| and just to be completely honest, I had to send seven ladies to other programs and back to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=16135)|
| 4:29:01| streets, and it was disheartening, and I understand y'all's position, but I do hope| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=16141)|
| 4:29:05| that you will hear mine as well. Chair recognizes Commissioner Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=16145)|
| 4:29:12| Thank you. Unless I'm interrupting Eddie here, I would make a motion to postpone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=16152)|
| 4:29:18| and I don't think we can affect anything that goes on in that church,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=16158)|
| 4:29:22| unless I'm mistaken, but that would be my motion. Well, and before we get a second, my motion was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=16162)|
| 4:29:27| going to be, could we move agenda item 22 to after 36 so we could hear 36 first and then make a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=16167)|
| 4:29:35| decision on 22 just so that we know, I mean, the applicant has a better understanding of what's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=16175)|
| 4:29:40| going to happen since she did make that, that she could use this in a different way for those 30| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=16180)|
| 4:29:47| days of postponement, but I think just postponing it without knowing where she's going to be on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=16187)|
| 4:29:51| number 36 kind of gets the cart before the horse. So, is there a way that we can make a motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=16191)|
| 4:29:57| to move item 22 just to after number 36 on the agenda since, or is that impermissible?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=16197)|
| 4:30:03| That's a question, Commissioner, I'd ask Ms. Brooks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=16203)|
| 4:30:06| Commissioner, I don't see a reason why you can't do that. I'm not sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=16206)|
| 4:30:20| if the, you can't, you can make a motion to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=16220)|
| 4:30:25| hear after the next agenda item, but I'm not sure that it necessarily impacts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=16225)|
| 4:30:32| I guess I'm not clear on how those two, it's a separate piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=16232)|
| 4:30:38| Well, what she was saying is that she could use the other one, but if we, I don't know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=16238)|
| 4:30:43| I don't want to presume to know how everybody's going to vote on item 36.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=16243)|
| 4:30:47| So, if we were to deny that, then I think she's got to rethink her whole thing. So,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=16247)|
| 4:30:51| that's why I'm, that's why my proposal was to move it to after item 36 that we take up 22.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=16251)|
| 4:30:57| And just to be clear, the postponement, it doesn't preclude them from, you know, making| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=16257)|
| 4:31:07| changes to their application after it's been postponed before it goes on the next month's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=16267)|
| 4:31:11| agenda or withdrawing it altogether. Commissioner, my suggestion is we follow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=16271)|
| 4:31:22| staff's recommendation on this one and move on. I think we need to be diligent in these kind of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=16282)|
| 4:31:30| matters so there's, it doesn't come back to haunt us later. All right. Then I'll just second| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=16290)|
| 4:31:36| Commissioner Hill's motion. All right. We have a motion by Commissioner Hill, seconded by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=16296)|

| 4:34:23| Ball Homes, 1914 Pinnacle Point Way, Knoxville, Tennessee 37922. We just asked for approval| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=16463)|

| 4:35:30| to represent my subdivision. I'm all for growth. I've been part of this community for 15 years now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=16530)|
| 4:35:38| and especially in this area. And I've been on this call since 1-30 and I've listened to everybody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=16538)|
| 4:35:45| across the board and I get to I get about a lot of people what are saying. And the biggest thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=16545)|
| 4:35:51| is I'm all about growth again. I'm all about people building. But all I've been hearing is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=16551)|
| 4:35:58| traffic. And these roads cannot handle the amount of traffic. Agenda number 16 with Josh| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=16558)|
| 4:36:06| Sanderson's with Smith Belt on the corner of West Emery and Beaver Ridge. We talked about that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=16566)|
| 4:36:14| slightly, but I live in this community and Carnes Valley Drive where it turns to West Emery is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=16574)|
| 4:36:21| always backed up a half a mile, two times a day. And West Emery Road that travels back behind to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=16581)|
| 4:36:28| Henderson Road, nobody really knows about the area right there, but there's only one stop sign,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=16588)|
| 4:36:33| but that West Emery Road curves and there's always dragsters. I mean, if police officers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=16593)|
| 4:36:39| would be back there, they can have a heyday with money. But I propose that they need to put a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=16599)|
| 4:36:46| three-way stop sign back there. The traffic engineers need to do a better job of doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=16606)|
| 4:36:51| their job first, I believe. I look at the big picture rather than the small picture of this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=16611)|
| 4:36:57| whole community. This land back here has a bunch of wildlife, turkeys, deers, hawks, rabbits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=16617)|
| 4:37:06| you name it, it's there. But this development going in, it's going to wipe those people up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=16626)|
| 4:37:09| wipe those animals out, and they're going to have to go somewhere else. And| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=16629)|
| 4:37:15| we just got to think smarter. And I've been hearing, I feel you guys are all for developers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=16635)|
| 4:37:21| and you're not for the residential community. And we residential communities pay tax dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=16641)|
| 4:37:29| and we need to be heard. And traffic right now is horrible. It's getting worse and worse by the day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=16649)|
| 4:37:36| With more residentials being built right now, the traffic engineer, they're going to have to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=16656)|
| 4:37:42| build stuff first rather than build these homes. I plead to you if you guys would just hear us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=16662)|
| 4:37:48| the community. I've never got a phone call or a knock at the door from J.S. Sanderson when he said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=16668)|
| 4:37:56| that he visited a few places. I'm right down the road. I never heard from him. And with Ball Homes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=16676)|

| 4:38:07| about, I mean, can we go down to like three units per acre rather than four? It'd be awesome, too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=16687)|
| 4:38:16| to have some type of community park back here. Because every time the Carnes Senior Center has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=16696)|
| 4:38:23| something, it's just, you can't find a parking space, you can't go down and play because it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=16703)|
| 4:38:27| just crowded with a whole bunch of traveling teams and all that stuff. So I'm just saying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=16707)|
| 4:38:33| we need to think smart. Think safety. Someone's going to get killed in these roads. And I've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=16713)|
| 4:38:37| seen motorcycles had to lay down their bikes. And that's how my father passed away because of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=16717)|
| 4:38:43| the roads not improved. And I've seen accidents and people killed, especially when West Emory| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=16723)|
| 4:38:49| dumped out onto Oak Ridge Highway. I've seen someone killed there. I mean, we've got to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=16729)|
| 4:38:55| improve rather than build right now. Then the building can continue. So I just ask if we can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=16735)|
| 4:39:02| just put this thing on hold and see what the traffic engineers can do about improving these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=16742)|
| 4:39:07| roads here. Doing some type of action. Think first, safety first, then build. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=16747)|
| 4:39:15| Thank you, Mr. Crumble.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=16755)|
| 4:39:23| Applicant, you want to go ahead and go?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=16763)|
| 4:39:25| Yes. This is a, we have an approved concept out there that was done a few months back. And as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=16765)|
| 4:39:35| part of that, we submitted a traffic impact study to both MPC and to Knox County Engineering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=16775)|
| 4:39:42| that's still applicable today. And we plan on doing what's in that traffic impact study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=16782)|
| 4:39:49| Furthermore, Carnes Valley Drive is an improved road up to West Emory Road. And Knox County has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=16789)|
| 4:39:57| recently completed construction of the Carnes Valley Extension, which connects Horton Valley| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=16797)|
| 4:40:04| Road over to Oak Ridge Highway to alleviate traffic concerns. All this, what's before you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=16804)|
| 4:40:14| today that's different from the previous concept is the addition of five single family lots in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=16814)|
| 4:40:21| single family section of this. When we did the engineering, we were able to gain five lots| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=16821)|
| 4:40:29| and stay within the existing zoning that is with the land today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=16829)|
| 4:40:36| And I'm open to any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=16836)|
| 4:40:39| Mr. Crumble, it looks like we're going to seven additional units from the previous approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=16839)|
| 4:40:47| Five additional.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=16847)|
| 4:40:49| Right. It shows you a total of 113 dwelling units in December and now we're looking at 120.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=16849)|
| 4:40:57| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=16857)|
| 4:41:00| I'd have to go back and look. But what we were going to was 55| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=16860)|
| 4:41:04| single family homes to 60 single family homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=16864)|
| 4:41:08| Right. This is Mike Reynolds with the planner reviewed this plan. The concept plan shows 62| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=16868)|
| 4:41:17| single family lots and then the same 58 attached units that were approved last time. So,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=16877)|
| 4:41:24| but they're, the current concept plan shows 62 lots for the single family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=16884)|
| 4:41:29| Which is 72. Okay. All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=16889)|
| 4:41:39| I understand there's traffic studies back here, but nobody, just live in the life of the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=16899)|
| 4:41:44| Just go out there for a week with us and you'll see how bad traffic is. Traffic data is just data,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=16904)|
| 4:41:50| just like the weather is going to rain today. It didn't hardly. They said we're supposed to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=16910)|
| 4:41:55| have hail between four and seven. Well, we didn't. I mean, the traffic data is just data.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=16915)|
| 4:42:00| Go out there and live with us in the community. And you'll see if there's an emergency, you can't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=16920)|
| 4:42:06| go anywhere because it's backed up because you got people coming from the Oak Ridge plant who| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=16926)|
| 4:42:11| lives in Knoxville, but yet they travel to Oak Ridge to work. And it just backs up even on people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=16931)|
| 4:42:21| avoid Carnes Valley road and go down Oak Ridge highway to the Carnes red light. Well, that backs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=16941)|
| 4:42:26| up to the sports complex. You need to experience it. Go out there one day, a whole week and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=16946)|
| 4:42:34| experience what we have to experience. Then when it floods, we have to go down a different road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=16954)|
| 4:42:39| because all the flooding happens. I apologize, but we're commission now is reviewing this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=16959)|
| 4:42:51| and we don't normally allow others to get start communicating with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=16971)|
| 4:42:58| Chair recognizes Commissioner Korbelik. Yes, I would like to direct your question to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=16978)|
| 4:43:04| Mike Reynolds regarding traffic. I think there is some confusion about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=16984)|
| 4:43:13| the traffic report when it might say that it's adequate. I think people are experiencing the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=16993)|
| 4:43:20| peak hours and get confused about what adequate means. They don't necessarily look at the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=17000)|
| 4:43:27| levels or use between the peak hours. Is there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=17007)|
| 4:43:32| some way you could just explain a traffic report in that way?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=17012)|
| 4:43:39| I'll try. And maybe the Knox County engineering might be able to step in where I kind of missed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=17019)|
| 4:43:45| it up here. But so we have different levels of traffic studies. For one thing, we have a level| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=17025)|
| 4:43:51| one, level two and level three. This particular project was a level one, which is our lowest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=17031)|
| 4:43:56| level of traffic study. It primarily looks at their access point to the existing roads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=17036)|
| 4:44:04| So in this case, it's their subdivision where we're the single family and some townhouse units| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=17044)|
| 4:44:09| come onto West Emory Road on the north side of the site. And then they also have two points| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=17049)|
| 4:44:15| of access on the eastern side of their site to West Emory Road, which is just for the townhouses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=17055)|
| 4:44:21| So that's what the traffic study primarily looked at with those access points. They do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=17061)|
| 4:44:25| do traffic counts in this case because of the pandemic traffic was a little bit off. So they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=17065)|
| 4:44:31| had to do an adjustment to those numbers, which is a best guess at this point of what those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=17071)|
| 4:44:36| adjustments could be. A lot of times they'll use some past traffic growth as a way to adjust| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=17076)|
| 4:44:43| numbers as well. So on a level one traffic study like this, we're primarily looking at the access| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=17083)|
| 4:44:51| points. And to the subdivision, we're not looking at how an intersection that's further away like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=17091)|
| 4:44:59| the West Emory and Beaver Ridge Road intersection, how that would be impacted by this development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=17099)|
| 4:45:07| But in the traffic state, really we'll be looking mainly at the peak hours as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=17107)|
| 4:45:15| That's really what it's trying to get at is that the peak hours, how is the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=17115)|
| 4:45:20| traffic going to be impacted. And if someone from the engineering department wants to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=17120)|
| 4:45:27| add anything to that or correct me in any way, feel free.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=17127)|
| 4:45:35| Yeah, Mike, I think this is Jim Stowe with Norse County Engineering. I think that that sounds very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=17135)|
| 4:45:39| accurate. The one point I would make is primarily of all these intersections you see are peak hour| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=17139)|
| 4:45:45| problems only. If you go out there in the middle of the day, obviously traffic, you know, is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=17145)|
| 4:45:50| flowing pretty well. But like a lot of county roads that have those peak hour issues. So but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=17150)|
| 4:45:57| I think Mike said it very well. Thank you. Chair recognizes Commissioner Scott Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=17157)|
| 4:46:07| Yeah, I was just going to mention to Mr. Trumbull who was talking about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=17167)|
| 4:46:14| you know, the problems there. I mean, I see you live in Walker's Gate. And I just, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=17174)|
| 4:46:20| just a few years ago, the people that lived out there were opposing the subdivision you now live| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=17180)|
| 4:46:24| in. And the problem is we as commissioners, you know, if we stopped approving developments and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=17184)|
| 4:46:32| said no more housing until roads get widened, they'd never get widened. I mean, they the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=17192)|
| 4:46:39| and the state focus their efforts and funding on problems when they get to a point that they need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=17199)|
| 4:46:44| addressing. And all we can rely on is the traffic studies and trying to put in and allow development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=17204)|
| 4:46:51| that is comparable to what's there now. So I'm going to make a motion we approve the concept| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=17211)|
| 4:46:59| plan subject to 11 conditions. So I make that motion, but knowing that whatever people that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=17219)|
| 4:47:06| move into this subdivision, they're going to be getting upset with us if we approve another| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=17226)|
| 4:47:11| subdivision. But that's just kind of the way I see it. So anyway, that's it. Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=17231)|
| 4:47:21| Second. Motion by Commissioner Scott Smith, second by Commissioner Roth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=17241)|
| 4:47:28| to approve the concept plan subject to 11 conditions per staff recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=17248)|
| 4:47:32| Thank you. Before we proceed, I didn't want to make a comment. I just want to kind of address| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=17252)|
| 4:47:40| what Mr. Trumbull said as well when he said it appeared that we were pro development or pro| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=17260)|
| 4:47:46| developer. And I've been on this commission a long time and those of us on this commission spend a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=17266)|
| 4:47:53| lot of time, a lot of our personal time that's unpaid researching these things and trying to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=17273)|
| 4:47:59| decide what's the right thing to do for the community and for the property owners, not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=17279)|
| 4:48:06| necessarily the developer, but the property owners, as well as the community. Our staff spends a lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=17286)|
| 4:48:12| of time analyzing these things to give us advice on what fits and what works with the zoning and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=17292)|
| 4:48:21| the plans. And I want to assure you that we don't sit on this commission simply| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=17301)|
| 4:48:31| to press development. That's not what this is about. It's about responsible development and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=17311)|
| 4:48:36| about a developing community and how do we do that in the best way possible. So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=17316)|

| 4:50:26| You know, we don't build roads or schools in anticipation. That would certainly be nice if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=17426)|
| 4:50:32| we could, but we just don't have the resources. No community has resources to do that. We always| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=17432)|
| 4:50:38| have to develop them in response to development and growth. And I wish the public could understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210408?start=17438)|
