| 0:02:04| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=124)|
| 0:02:05| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=125)|
| 0:02:06| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=126)|
| 0:02:07| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=127)|
| 0:02:08| The ayes have it and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=128)|
| 0:02:09| For the mayor's report, I just want to remind everybody that we're in the last few days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=129)|
| 0:02:14| of early voting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=134)|
| 0:02:16| Early voting goes through Thursday, this Thursday, November 1st, 10 a.m. to 8 p.m. at most of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=136)|
| 0:02:23| the sites.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=143)|
| 0:02:24| The site here at the city county building has different hours, so I encourage you to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=144)|
| 0:02:28| go to knoxvotes.org, which is the election commission's site and has a list of all of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=148)|
| 0:02:34| the early voting locations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=154)|
| 0:02:38| And election day is, of course, Tuesday, November 6th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=158)|
| 0:02:43| And so we encourage you to vote that day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=163)|
| 0:02:45| Polls are open from 8 to 8.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=165)|
| 0:02:47| And again, I want to remind everybody that this council spent months and months working| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=167)|
| 0:02:52| with the administration to propose a charter amendment that closes the current pension| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=172)|
| 0:03:00| plan to future employees and substitutes a hybrid pension plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=180)|
| 0:03:05| We know this will drastically reduce future costs and future investment risk for our city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=185)|
| 0:03:09| taxpayers and, at the same time, continues to provide a competitive benefit package so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=189)|
| 0:03:15| we can recruit and retain our police officers, our firefighters, and our public sector employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=195)|
| 0:03:20| So we encourage you all to vote for that charter amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=200)|
| 0:03:23| It is the last item on the ballot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=203)|
| 0:03:26| If you are a city voter, you go all the way through voting for your candidates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=206)|
| 0:03:31| Then there are seven county charter amendments that you go through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=211)|
| 0:03:36| And then you will see the city charter amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=216)|
| 0:03:39| So we ask that you stay in there for the whole, for all of the different issues and get to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=219)|
| 0:03:45| the very end of the ballot and support that change for the future of our city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=225)|
| 0:03:50| I also want to say we had several great announcements this past week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=230)|
| 0:03:54| Some of us were out at ADT Security Services out west.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=234)|
| 0:03:58| They announced 300 new jobs that will be coming to their call center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=238)|
| 0:04:03| I attended the ribbon cutting for Tupelo Honey, which is great news.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=243)|
| 0:04:08| They are on Market Square.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=248)|
| 0:04:10| And they said, by the way, they were very complimentary of the welcome they received| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=250)|
| 0:04:14| in Knoxville and the work they received from city staff to make sure they got through all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=254)|
| 0:04:19| the permits and all the inspections and such so that they could open up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=259)|
| 0:04:23| And we appreciated hearing that from them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=263)|
| 0:04:26| We were also at a top-out event for Embassy Suites, which is going up again out west.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=266)|
| 0:04:31| And that's a new hotel, a first time for an Embassy Suites here in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=271)|
| 0:04:37| And they plan to have their grand opening sometime in the spring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=277)|
| 0:04:41| We also learned that Anthropologie will be coming into the Bearden area, which is, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=281)|
| 0:04:46| a new retail store that is affiliated with Urban Outfitters who will be coming downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=286)|
| 0:04:52| So all of that is good news for Knoxville and for our economy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=292)|
| 0:04:56| So we thank all those businesses that are coming in or are expanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=296)|
| 0:05:01| And finally, I want to remind everybody, before we meet again, there will be Friday, November| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=301)|
| 0:05:06| 9th, is when we celebrate Veterans Day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=306)|
| 0:05:08| And there is a Veterans Day parade downtown starting at 10.30 in the morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=308)|
| 0:05:13| And there are a number of events in our city and county celebrating and honoring our veterans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=313)|
| 0:05:19| So I encourage everybody to participate in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=319)|
| 0:05:22| And, of course, we thank our veterans for the service to our country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=322)|
| 0:05:27| And that is all for my report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=327)|
| 0:05:29| Any reports of counsel?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=329)|
| 0:05:31| Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=331)|
| 0:05:32| Yes, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=332)|
| 0:05:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=333)|
| 0:05:34| I have two things, both related to CAT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=334)|
| 0:05:37| I reported, I think, maybe a couple of weeks ago that the headquarters there is now a place where people can register to vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=337)|
| 0:05:46| And over 100 people did register to vote at the new CAT headquarters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=346)|
| 0:05:52| Also, I passed out a paper to all the council concerning the campus transit service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=352)|
| 0:06:02| And if anybody has any questions about that, you can ask Ms. Cindy McGinnis, who is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=362)|
| 0:06:09| That's all that I have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=369)|
| 0:06:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=371)|
| 0:06:12| Councilwoman Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=372)|
| 0:06:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=373)|
| 0:06:14| This Friday afternoon at 3 p.m. at the Fred Myrick Mausoleum on Richmond Hill,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=374)|
| 0:06:20| the Westview Historical District will announce their arrival, I guess, for lack of a better term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=380)|
| 0:06:28| For about the past two and a half years, several community agencies have worked together to clear three of the cemeteries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=388)|
| 0:06:36| This small Westview neighborhood has six cemeteries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=396)|
| 0:06:39| And I think Mayor O'Hara mentioned last week at a dinner that you look at things in your area and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=399)|
| 0:06:45| what can we do with this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=405)|
| 0:06:47| And that's what they've done and created a historical district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=407)|
| 0:06:50| So it's at 3 p.m. at the Myrick Mausoleum on Richmond Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=410)|
| 0:06:55| The public is invited, and we will do some things and have some other announcements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=415)|
| 0:07:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=420)|
| 0:07:02| Councilman Grieve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=422)|
| 0:07:04| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=424)|

| 0:07:10| And hopefully in the next couple of weeks we'll be announcing that we'll have a couple of public forums.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=430)|
| 0:07:15| But I'll let you know about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=435)|
| 0:07:17| You will finish in our lifetime.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=437)|
| 0:07:20| I think we're celebrating our year anniversary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=440)|
| 0:07:23| Maybe that's part of tomorrow night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=443)|
| 0:07:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=446)|

| 0:07:56| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=476)|

| 0:08:00| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=480)|

| 0:08:08| and they've done a lot of extra work landscaping and making it attractive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=488)|

| 0:09:48| We do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=588)|
| 0:09:49| Good announcement, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=589)|
| 0:09:50| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=590)|
| 0:09:51| So I'll call on our folks that have signed up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=591)|
| 0:09:53| Mr. Kramer, you want to go first?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=593)|
| 0:09:54| Say your name and address, please, for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=594)|
| 0:09:56| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=596)|
| 0:09:57| My name is Jackson Kramer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=597)|
| 0:09:58| My address is 800 South Gay Street, Suite 2500, Knoxville 37929.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=598)|
| 0:10:03| And I represent the United States Cellular Corporation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=603)|
| 0:10:07| And as you know, we had filed, U.S. Cellular had filed an application for a use on review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=607)|
| 0:10:14| to construct a 150-foot telecommunications monopole at 5020 Washington Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=614)|
| 0:10:21| And that use on review application was approved at the September 13th MPC meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=621)|
| 0:10:27| Subsequently, the Alice Bell Spring Hill Neighborhood Association appealed that decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=627)|
| 0:10:32| We have, I hope each of you had a chance to look at the letter that we sent out today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=632)|
| 0:10:37| We have reached an agreement with the Neighborhood Association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=637)|
| 0:10:41| And therefore, we would ask that this council approve MPC's action in affirming the use on review application| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=641)|
| 0:10:50| to construct the telecommunications monopole, but amend that to incorporate the nine conditions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=650)|
| 0:10:58| I believe it is, in my letter to each of you today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=658)|
| 0:11:03| And we would ask for a motion along those lines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=663)|
| 0:11:07| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=667)|
| 0:11:08| Mr. Klein, did you want to also speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=668)|
| 0:11:11| I'm Wayne Klein, 617 Main Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=671)|
| 0:11:14| I represent the Alice Bell Spring Hills Neighborhood Association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=674)|
| 0:11:19| In this case, we have come to terms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=679)|
| 0:11:22| This is, I believe, a landmark and a new benchmark for the city of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=682)|
| 0:11:28| for purposes of placing a cell tower in a community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=688)|
| 0:11:34| The community agrees, accepts a monopole of 140 feet, an American flag at the top.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=694)|
| 0:11:40| All the antennas for the cellular tower are inside the pole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=700)|
| 0:11:45| The flag will be lit at night, every night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=705)|
| 0:11:49| There will be a brick wall at the bottom instead of a chain link fence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=709)|
| 0:11:53| And some Lillian cypress that are at least three years old that are planted on the outside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=713)|
| 0:11:59| I think it's going to be something to look at instead of something looking at you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=719)|
| 0:12:05| And I support what Mr. J. Kramer said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=725)|
| 0:12:09| which is we need you all to approve the amended application on behalf of U.S. Cellular.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=729)|
| 0:12:18| And at that point, I can withdraw our appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=738)|
| 0:12:23| Very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=743)|
| 0:12:24| Councilman Dallavopi?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=744)|
| 0:12:25| Yes, thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=745)|
| 0:12:26| I'm going to make that motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=746)|
| 0:12:27| But first I want to say that I want to congratulate both the community and the company for what they have done in this situation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=747)|
| 0:12:34| as well as the two lawyers who didn't go out to kill each other but to try to find a solution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=754)|
| 0:12:40| And I think that both the community and the city is a winner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=760)|
| 0:12:45| I think that we all know that we use these cell phones,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=765)|
| 0:12:49| and apparently we use more data than we did before, and we're going to have more of these things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=769)|
| 0:12:54| And I congratulate you guys for working this out because it was important to the community that their gateway not be damaged by an industrial look.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=774)|
| 0:13:03| And I think you worked hard to make it look better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=783)|
| 0:13:06| So, again, I want to thank these folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=786)|
| 0:13:07| And now I want to make the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=787)|
| 0:13:09| And I'm going to move that we first amend the MPC use on review approval to include the conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=789)|
| 0:13:17| And I'm going to ask Mr. Kramer if he would submit a copy of that letter to Miss Cindy Mitchell to make it as an exhibit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=797)|
| 0:13:24| to either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=804)|
| 0:13:25| She already has it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=805)|
| 0:13:26| She has a copy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=806)|
| 0:13:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=807)|
| 0:13:28| The exhibit either to 10A or to the minutes, but I'm not sure which is the most appropriate way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=808)|
| 0:13:32| And it's going to be a formal exhibit so that it's up record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=812)|
| 0:13:39| And then I guess after we move to amend, I'll move that we approve it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=819)|
| 0:13:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=824)|
| 0:13:45| I'll second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=825)|
| 0:13:46| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=826)|
| 0:13:47| Is there any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=827)|
| 0:13:49| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=829)|
| 0:13:50| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=830)|
| 0:13:51| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=831)|
| 0:13:52| The ayes have it and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=832)|
| 0:13:54| Now I'd like to make the motion that we actually approve the amended use on review, if that's appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=834)|
| 0:14:00| I think now we need a motion to withdraw the appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=840)|
| 0:14:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=845)|
| 0:14:06| So we've actually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=846)|
| 0:14:07| Subject to the amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=847)|
| 0:14:08| We just did the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=848)|
| 0:14:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=849)|
| 0:14:10| We just did the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=850)|
| 0:14:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=851)|
| 0:14:12| Well, fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=852)|
| 0:14:13| Then I move that we, I guess we're accepting the withdrawal of the appeal basically on the condition that we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=853)|
| 0:14:18| approved this amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=858)|
| 0:14:20| And so I would ask that you vote in favor of the withdrawal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=860)|
| 0:14:25| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=865)|
| 0:14:26| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=866)|
| 0:14:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=867)|
| 0:14:28| Councilman Grieve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=868)|
| 0:14:29| Was the neighborhood going to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=869)|
| 0:14:31| Well, they did speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=871)|
| 0:14:32| Mr. Klein represented them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=872)|
| 0:14:35| Any of the neighborhood individuals?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=875)|
| 0:14:37| And any other individuals want to speak or speaking through your attorney?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=877)|
| 0:14:44| I think we've drafted Gene Mathis, whether he knew it or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=884)|
| 0:14:47| Mr. Mathis, please state your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=887)|

| 0:14:57| We are pleased that we're able to come to you with a compromise that the community is willing to accept| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=897)|
| 0:15:03| and that we think we have now a beautiful landmark that lets you know if you're coming off of 640,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=903)|
| 0:15:09| this is the Aliceville-Spring Hill neighborhood right behind our beautiful park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=909)|
| 0:15:13| So we thank both Wayne and the U.S. cellular attorney for their compromise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=913)|
| 0:15:20| We're proud of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=920)|
| 0:15:21| Is everybody going to want a monopole in their neighborhood now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=921)|
| 0:15:27| If they have the right flag, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=927)|
| 0:15:29| But there are Americans there in Aliceville, and the flag will tell us that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=929)|
| 0:15:33| That's true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=933)|
| 0:15:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=934)|
| 0:15:35| Thank you, Mr. Mathis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=935)|
| 0:15:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=937)|

| 0:16:54| Yeah, I wonder, Becky, if you could give us just the nickels worth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=1014)|
| 0:16:57| But one of the things we're trying to do, I gather, is help the neighborhoods be ready| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=1017)|
| 0:17:02| to face disasters and be responsive in appropriate ways and work with our police and fire and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=1022)|
| 0:17:08| other agencies that do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=1028)|

| 0:17:17| Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=1037)|
| 0:17:18| David Massey, 400 Main Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=1038)|
| 0:17:20| I'm the Neighborhoods Coordinator for the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=1040)|
| 0:17:23| We actually had this program conceived for more than a couple of years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=1043)|
| 0:17:28| I think it's an idea we picked up at a Neighborhoods USA conference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=1048)|
| 0:17:32| We've wanted to do it for a long time but didn't have the staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=1052)|
| 0:17:37| We now have an AmeriCorps volunteer, Eden Slater, who's here tonight working on this program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=1057)|
| 0:17:46| It's basically designed to assist neighborhood organizations to develop their own neighborhood-level| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=1066)|
| 0:17:54| emergency preparedness plans so that they can act as a group to be first responders in their neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=1074)|
| 0:18:04| in the event that professional emergency personnel cannot get to the scene| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=1084)|
| 0:18:09| and then to step aside when the professional personnel do get to the scene.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=1089)|
| 0:18:14| And so we have been working with Knoxville Emergency Management Agency, KEMA, the police department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=1094)|
| 0:18:21| fire department, health department, Red Cross,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=1101)|
| 0:18:24| and more collaboration is on the way to put together a pilot program in at least three neighborhoods this year through June,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=1104)|
| 0:18:34| where we would demonstrate the ability of neighborhood groups, organized neighborhood groups,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=1114)|
| 0:18:39| to take this on and then run through some training and some testing of that program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=1119)|
| 0:18:50| So it's really this grant came along after we conceived of this, but it really is right down our alley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=1130)|
| 0:18:59| FEMA is saying emergency preparedness cannot be done at a government-centric level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=1139)|
| 0:19:06| It's got to be done at a very local level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=1146)|
| 0:19:10| And this application is really aimed at, for this year, is really aimed at neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=1150)|
| 0:19:16| The events of this past week have shown how fast and dangerous emergencies can arise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=1156)|
| 0:19:21| and why you need to be ready.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=1161)|
| 0:19:22| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=1162)|
| 0:19:23| It's a great program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=1163)|
| 0:19:24| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=1164)|
| 0:19:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=1165)|
| 0:19:26| Thank you, Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=1166)|
| 0:19:27| I don't have your name tag there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=1167)|
| 0:19:28| I know who to call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=1168)|
| 0:19:29| Now you know who I am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=1169)|
| 0:19:31| I was just going to say ditto to what Councilman Della Vopi said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=1171)|
| 0:19:35| because that's very appropriate given what has just happened in other parts of the country,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=1175)|
| 0:19:39| that the neighborhoods would be prepared in case people cannot get in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=1179)|
| 0:19:44| So I think that's a very good thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=1184)|
| 0:19:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=1186)|
| 0:19:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=1187)|

| 0:19:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=1189)|
| 0:19:50| I have two neighborhoods in the third district who are very interested in being one of the three, two of the three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=1190)|
| 0:19:56| But whether or not they're selected or not, they think this is a great idea,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=1196)|
| 0:20:00| and I think it's something that could be contagious in all neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=1200)|
| 0:20:05| I commend you for moving forward with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=1205)|
| 0:20:09| We've had issues with tornadoes and high winds and rains here in Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=1209)|
| 0:20:14| and it's really good to be on top of things sooner than later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=1214)|
| 0:20:18| Thank you, and thank you for your support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=1218)|
| 0:20:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=1221)|
| 0:20:22| Okay, we have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=1222)|
| 0:20:23| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=1223)|

| 0:20:54| Help me out here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=1254)|
| 0:20:55| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=1255)|
| 0:20:57| I've been called worse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=1257)|
| 0:21:00| I just wanted to, for Becky, to address this a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=1260)|
| 0:21:03| As much as I applaud working with the neighborhoods and working on blighted properties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=1263)|
| 0:21:09| I'm a little bit concerned about the number of properties we've bought,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=1269)|
| 0:21:12| and I just wanted to get an update on how we're selling them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=1272)|
| 0:21:15| and that we're not just keeping them on our tax roll and kind of what our plan is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=1275)|
| 0:21:19| And then part of that, if you'd just address the forest hills that we took back a few months ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=1279)|
| 0:21:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=1285)|
| 0:21:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=1286)|
| 0:21:27| Well, looking back, starting in about December of 2008, the city has acquired eight properties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=1287)|
| 0:21:40| and of those eight, six have sold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=1300)|
| 0:21:43| So they are in the hands of new property owners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=1303)|
| 0:21:47| Many of those have been redeveloped.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=1307)|
| 0:21:50| Forest Hills is still open for purchase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=1310)|
| 0:21:53| It's still on the market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=1313)|
| 0:21:55| There's one on Martin Luther King as well that's still for sale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=1315)|
| 0:21:59| We have three in process of being acquired that we've brought to you this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=1319)|
| 0:22:05| And so the city hasn't completed those activities to acquire them, but they're in process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=1325)|
| 0:22:10| And then we're asking for your approval to acquire four more tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=1330)|
| 0:22:17| One reason why we're bringing so many at once is the tax assessed values on these properties was high.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=1337)|
| 0:22:24| It was higher than our appraised values.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=1344)|
| 0:22:27| So we asked the assessor's office to review their assessments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=1347)|
| 0:22:33| And so all of these tax assessed values have been brought down so that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=1353)|
| 0:22:40| since if we have to go through eminent domain to purchase these,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=1360)|
| 0:22:44| we have to deposit the greater of the appraised value or the assessed value.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=1364)|
| 0:22:49| So we wanted those values to be much more in line, which they are now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=1369)|
| 0:22:56| Did you have another question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=1376)|
| 0:22:57| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=1377)|
| 0:22:59| No, I just wanted to make sure that you brought in eight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=1379)|
| 0:23:01| We sold six.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=1381)|
| 0:23:03| You know, I visited two weeks ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=1383)|
| 0:23:05| Duane and I went out to 611 Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=1385)|
| 0:23:08| It was one of the properties that are on here that they purchased for $9,500 back in March.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=1388)|
| 0:23:15| And we went out last week, and they stripped it, and they put new plumbing in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=1395)|
| 0:23:20| and they got ready to sheetrock it and return it to a really nice use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=1400)|
| 0:23:26| So, you know, I'm all in favor of doing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=1406)|
| 0:23:28| I just want to make sure it's being returned to the private rolls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=1408)|
| 0:23:32| I find it a little bit interesting that we appealed a tax on ourselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=1412)|
| 0:23:36| Well, we didn't really appeal it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=1416)|
| 0:23:37| We asked for a review of the assessment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=1417)|
| 0:23:40| But your other question was about forest hills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=1420)|
| 0:23:43| Forest hills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=1423)|
| 0:23:44| Yes, we had an applicant fill out the homemaker application, but they never turned it in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=1424)|
| 0:23:50| They kind of backed out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=1430)|
| 0:23:52| We are getting ready to list that property with a realtor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=1432)|
| 0:23:55| and we think once we get it on MLS that there will be more activity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=1435)|
| 0:24:00| We also have it listed on Knox Heritage's website.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=1440)|
| 0:24:03| They list a number of properties in historic neighborhoods, so it's listed there as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=1443)|
| 0:24:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=1448)|
| 0:24:10| Councilman Grave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=1450)|
| 0:24:11| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=1451)|
| 0:24:12| Could you just, for the general population, just explain about this program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=1452)|
| 0:24:15| and how it works from the standpoint of a neighborhood, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=1455)|
| 0:24:18| maybe coming to you with some blighted property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=1458)|
| 0:24:20| Explain the process that we go through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=1460)|
| 0:24:25| A lot of these properties that we're talking about this evening have come to us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=1465)|
| 0:24:29| through the Chronic Problem Property Task Force, which is a committee of different –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=1469)|
| 0:24:35| it's an interdepartmental committee at the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=1475)|
| 0:24:38| So these may be properties that have had a lot of complaints from the police department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=1478)|
| 0:24:44| fire department, neighborhood groups, codes enforcement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=1484)|
| 0:24:50| properties that are a blight on the neighborhood and a continual problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=1490)|
| 0:24:55| And, you know, we have funds that you've allocated to the community development department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=1495)|
| 0:25:05| for acquisition, and we work through the list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=1505)|
| 0:25:10| Basically, we figure out what properties would be the best to acquire at any given time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=1510)|
| 0:25:17| based on interest in others to redevelop these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=1517)|
| 0:25:23| So sometimes we may skip over one that may be in line if there's interest from another group,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=1523)|
| 0:25:30| a neighbor, somebody like that to actually redevelop it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=1530)|
| 0:25:34| But we start the process, we bring that to council for approval,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=1534)|
| 0:25:40| and then KCDC acts as our acquisition body, and they actually do the acquisition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=1540)|
| 0:25:46| Because many of these have poor title, they have deceased owners, they have no wills,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=1546)|
| 0:25:53| and so they have to go through eminent domain proceedings, and KCDC handles all that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=1553)|
| 0:26:00| And then we list these properties on the Homemakers Program for sale once we have ownership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=1560)|
| 0:26:07| In the meantime, we may stabilize it, we may board it, we keep it mowed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=1567)|
| 0:26:12| we take care of the immediate problems with the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=1572)|
| 0:26:17| and then people can fill out an application with Homemakers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=1577)|
| 0:26:22| They have to have a plan for the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=1582)|
| 0:26:26| They can't just buy it and sit on it, but they have to have a redevelopment plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=1586)|
| 0:26:30| If it's a vacant lot, they need to show us how they're going to rebuild housing on this lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=1590)|
| 0:26:37| If it's a structure, then they need to show that they're going to rehab it for sale or to live in or to rent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=1597)|
| 0:26:44| And we make sure they have their financing in place before their application's approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=1604)|
| 0:26:50| There is a Homemakers Committee that reviews all these applications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=1610)|
| 0:26:55| It's not just our department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=1615)|
| 0:26:57| And from there, if the new buyer doesn't do what they say they're going to do by their homemaker application,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=1617)|
| 0:27:12| then we have the authority to take that property back so that it's not a continual blight on the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=1632)|
| 0:27:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=1641)|
| 0:27:22| Councilman Dallavope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=1642)|
| 0:27:23| Yes, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=1643)|
| 0:27:24| I think Becky has done a long way to answering both my questions and giving a good background explanation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=1644)|
| 0:27:29| We have four of these tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=1649)|
| 0:27:30| But, I mean, the bottom line is the old saying, one bad apple can spoil the barrel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=1650)|
| 0:27:36| And if you have one of these properties on a block or in a neighborhood, it can help tear it down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=1656)|
| 0:27:41| And the first one we have in front of us shows violations, dirty lot violations and structural violations going back to 2002,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=1661)|
| 0:27:50| coming before the Better Building Board in ordering that the problems be eliminated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=1670)|
| 0:27:56| So I'm glad that we're stepping in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=1676)|
| 0:27:57| And I think we are doing positive good by bringing health back to the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=1677)|
| 0:28:02| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=1682)|
| 0:28:03| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=1683)|
| 0:28:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=1684)|
| 0:28:05| Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=1685)|
| 0:28:06| I went by and looked at that property today since it's in my district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=1686)|
| 0:28:09| But I wanted to thank you, Ms. Wade, for your department and what you all are doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=1689)|
| 0:28:15| And also the mayor, because it's a major, major problem with these blighted properties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=1695)|
| 0:28:20| and certainly may revive some of these neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=1700)|
| 0:28:23| So just thank you for the work that you're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=1703)|
| 0:28:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=1706)|
| 0:28:27| It's not a simple process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=1707)|
| 0:28:28| It takes a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=1708)|
| 0:28:29| I mean, these properties have to be determined and certified blighted with the Better Building Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=1709)|
| 0:28:36| There's a length of time between each one of those actions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=1716)|
| 0:28:39| It's six months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=1719)|
| 0:28:40| So it's not something we can do immediately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=1720)|
| 0:28:44| So it takes a lot of staff time to get this completed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=1724)|
| 0:28:49| And just a reminder, we are very proactive about vacant and blighted properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=1729)|
| 0:28:54| Council and the budget that you all approved this year, this is one of our goals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=1734)|
| 0:28:58| to really be able to tackle that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=1738)|
| 0:28:59| And when prevention doesn't work and codes enforcement doesn't work, then we go to acquisition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=1739)|
| 0:29:05| And as Becky has mentioned, it's paid off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=1745)|
| 0:29:08| It's really helping those individual properties and then the neighbors around them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=1748)|
| 0:29:13| So we have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=1753)|
| 0:29:14| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=1754)|

| 0:30:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=1857)|
| 0:30:58| Mr. Hagerman, I've asked you this question through an email,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=1858)|
| 0:31:01| and now I want the people who have contacted me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=1861)|
| 0:31:05| How will this impact the completion of the paving of Middlebrook Pike?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=1865)|
| 0:31:09| I'm Jim Hagerman, Director of Engineering for City of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=1869)|
| 0:31:15| There is a segment about 400 feet long that will not get paved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=1875)|
| 0:31:21| not get resurfaced with the rest of Middlebrook Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=1881)|
| 0:31:25| That's the area that we're working on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=1885)|
| 0:31:27| It's just long enough for the taper from the new turn lane that we're putting in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=1887)|
| 0:31:32| So just the road goes southwest, northeast there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=1892)|
| 0:31:37| so just southwest of the 21st intersection to about 400 feet up the street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=1897)|
| 0:31:46| will not get resurfaced until spring after we reconfigure the street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=1906)|
| 0:31:53| and we're going to move some utilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=1913)|
| 0:31:55| We will be tearing it up some between now and then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=1915)|
| 0:31:58| So this will be the final touch will be that we will resurface that segment sometime in the spring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=1918)|
| 0:32:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=1928)|
| 0:32:09| I understand that your department has a schedule and TDOT has a schedule,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=1929)|
| 0:32:16| and the two schedules are not always aligned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=1936)|
| 0:32:19| Is there anything that we could do to bring a better alignment of those activities?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=1939)|
| 0:32:25| I think there's probably some improvements that we can make in terms of communication.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=1945)|
| 0:32:29| I do not know how far in advance TDOT actually plans out their resurfacing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=1949)|
| 0:32:36| If it's like us, we don't necessarily plan out real specifically when we resurface,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=1956)|
| 0:32:46| although we usually know within a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=1966)|
| 0:32:49| In this particular case, whether through our fault or TDOT's fault,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=1969)|
| 0:32:56| we didn't get warning until fairly soon before we were finishing the planning process of our project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=1976)|
| 0:33:06| that they were going to resurface.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=1986)|
| 0:33:08| Obviously it's needed it for a while, but that doesn't necessarily mean they're on top of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=1988)|
| 0:33:14| But, yeah, there are some improvements we can make in communication there, and we will work on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=1994)|
| 0:33:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=2003)|
| 0:33:24| Well, I'm not interested in the blame game and finger pointing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=2004)|
| 0:33:26| I'm just interested in that road surface being smooth so that people don't e-mail| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=2006)|
| 0:33:31| and call me about their cars going out of alignment because it is so washboard-like in its nature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=2011)|
| 0:33:37| So the sooner we can move this forward, the better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=2017)|
| 0:33:41| I know the Transportation Commissioner was in town a couple of weeks ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=2021)|
| 0:33:44| and if I remember correctly, Mayor, he did say that he really wants to work with local entities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=2024)|
| 0:33:50| so that there can be a smoother process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=2030)|
| 0:33:54| And so this might be a good opportunity to test that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=2034)|
| 0:33:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=2038)|
| 0:33:59| Agreed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=2039)|
| 0:34:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=2040)|
| 0:34:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=2041)|
| 0:34:02| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=2042)|
| 0:34:03| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=2043)|
| 0:34:04| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=2044)|
| 0:34:05| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=2045)|
| 0:34:06| Abstain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=2046)|
| 0:34:07| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=2047)|
| 0:34:08| We have eight for and one abstention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=2048)|
| 0:34:09| Motion passes and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=2049)|
| 0:34:11| 11-I is a resolution authorizing the mayor to enter into an agreement with Knoxville Convention| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=2051)|
| 0:34:16| and Visitors Bureau, Inc., DBA Visit Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=2056)|
| 0:34:19| for the provision of destination marketing and event management services for an initial term of 20 months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=2059)|
| 0:34:25| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=2065)|
| 0:34:26| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=2066)|
| 0:34:27| Motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=2067)|
| 0:34:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=2068)|
| 0:34:29| Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=2069)|
| 0:34:31| Sorry about my earlier brain freeze.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=2071)|
| 0:34:34| Well, having just we just got this, just a couple just this week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=2074)|
| 0:34:40| but I applaud, Mayor, your staff and Eddie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=2080)|
| 0:34:44| I talked to Eddie this week about it, and I applaud how this thing has come together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=2084)|
| 0:34:48| and how you've worked together with the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=2088)|
| 0:34:51| It's certainly something that you and I have talked about and I've talked about with others,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=2091)|
| 0:34:54| how do we work together better with the county in coming with a unified plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=2094)|
| 0:34:58| And I applaud that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=2098)|
| 0:35:00| I applaud that you put measurements in a contract that we can, that we will,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=2100)|
| 0:35:05| based on what I read, that we're going to be back here in a quarter and be able to ask about it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=2105)|
| 0:35:10| and ask what the measurement, how we're against those goals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=2110)|
| 0:35:13| And, you know, I applaud that because I think you've had a lot of distrust in the community about this, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=2113)|
| 0:35:19| about this organization, the past, primarily the past executive director of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=2119)|
| 0:35:24| So make the goals reasonable and obtainable, but make them earn their money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=2124)|
| 0:35:29| That would be certainly part of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=2129)|
| 0:35:33| You know, and lay on them, and then report back to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=2133)|
| 0:35:36| And I look forward to hearing about it and hearing how we can move Nossel forward in the tourism.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=2136)|
| 0:35:40| So thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=2140)|
| 0:35:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=2141)|
| 0:35:42| Vice Mayor Pavlis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=2142)|
| 0:35:43| Yeah, and I agree with that, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=2143)|
| 0:35:45| I think this is a little bit more in line with what you would see nationally as far as Convention of Visitors Bureaus go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=2145)|
| 0:35:52| But, you know, I want to say, too, George alluded to the fact that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=2152)|
| 0:35:56| obviously they've been in the news a lot lately and not in a good light.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=2156)|
| 0:36:02| I've served two stints as a board member on that board there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=2162)|
| 0:36:08| I've basically been in the hospitality industry all my adult life, worked at the downtown Hilton, in fact,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=2168)|
| 0:36:14| and sales there, and I understand how that business works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=2174)|
| 0:36:18| And I'm very glad that this was the staff that is there now is going to be able to continue to function.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=2178)|
| 0:36:25| Because let me say a couple of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=2185)|
| 0:36:27| Number one, you know, when you work at a Convention of Visitors Bureau, particularly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=2187)|
| 0:36:33| they'll book events three to five years out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=2193)|
| 0:36:37| And the, you know, the relationships that this sales team has and their management has across this country is invaluable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=2197)|
| 0:36:49| And it would have been a real disservice to us here in Knoxville and Knox County had, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=2209)|
| 0:36:58| a lot of these folks perhaps not been there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=2218)|
| 0:37:00| And that could have very well been the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=2220)|
| 0:37:02| So I think it's very important from an industry perspective that we have the continuity that we've had in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=2222)|
| 0:37:10| I worked with Ms. Bumpus not only when I was at the Hilton, but, you know, as a board member, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=2230)|
| 0:37:16| I've seen her function, and I've got all the confidence in the world that her| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=2236)|
| 0:37:20| and her staff can continue on and meet the goals that are set forth in this contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=2240)|
| 0:37:25| They're entering into it, so they feel very confident that they can meet those goals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=2245)|
| 0:37:31| And I think they can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=2251)|
| 0:37:33| But more than anything else, I think you judge an organization not only in the good times but in the bad times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=2253)|
| 0:37:38| And I've seen continuity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=2258)|
| 0:37:40| I haven't seen people distressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=2260)|
| 0:37:43| I haven't seen people throwing up their hands and going, oh, what in the world is going on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=2263)|
| 0:37:48| It will stay the course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=2268)|
| 0:37:49| You know, don't take your eye off the bull's eye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=2269)|
| 0:37:52| This is what we've got to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=2272)|
| 0:37:53| Don't read the papers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=2273)|
| 0:37:54| It's just like a sports team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=2274)|
| 0:37:56| So I commend not only, you know, the leadership there, but the team for taking that leadership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=2276)|
| 0:38:03| And I think it's been ñ I think they've just done a great job with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=2283)|
| 0:38:07| I'm certainly going to support it and just really look forward to the next 20 months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=2287)|
| 0:38:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=2293)|
| 0:38:14| Councilman Della Vopi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=2294)|
| 0:38:15| Yes, thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=2295)|
| 0:38:17| I just wanted to say that I, too, am pleased that we have gotten over the hump,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=2297)|
| 0:38:22| and I think that this is a good proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=2302)|
| 0:38:25| I was pleased to see that our Visit Knoxville group has teamed up with a quality consultant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=2305)|
| 0:38:32| to bring some outside expertise in to get whatever help we can with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=2312)|
| 0:38:37| And this operation is really a partnership with all of the businesses in Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=2317)|
| 0:38:42| and all of the governmental entities that deal with tourists to pull together, to share information,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=2322)|
| 0:38:49| and to market Knoxville to the world because it's a great city, it's a great place to visit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=2329)|
| 0:38:54| and we want them to come here, have a good time, and leave their dollars behind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=2334)|
| 0:38:57| And I think Visit Knoxville is going to do a great job, and we're pulling for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=2337)|
| 0:39:01| So thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=2341)|
| 0:39:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=2342)|
| 0:39:03| Councilwoman Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=2343)|
| 0:39:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=2344)|
| 0:39:05| I pretty much agree with everything folks have said here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=2345)|
| 0:39:09| In addition to the sales group maintaining continuity, and we've got booking several years ahead,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=2349)|
| 0:39:16| and Kim's leadership and the others at the Visit Knoxville is moving the group forward during a tough time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=2356)|
| 0:39:24| But there is a great deal that goes on behind the scenes to make any of these things go just as smoothly as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=2364)|
| 0:39:32| And I think this group does bring the experience, but more importantly, the energy and enthusiasm to take us to the next level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=2372)|
| 0:39:41| The performance standards are good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=2381)|
| 0:39:43| I've had some positive feedback from very loud naysayers in past months that they think that this is a positive step.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=2383)|
| 0:39:51| So everybody who is involved in getting us to this point, pat yourselves on the back, and let's get people here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=2391)|
| 0:39:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=2398)|
| 0:39:59| Councilman Grave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=2399)|
| 0:40:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=2400)|
| 0:40:01| I, too, am in support of this, and I did have a conversation with Mr. Maness this afternoon,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=2401)|
| 0:40:07| but I thought maybe that some of the questions that came up, and maybe, Eddie, you could answer these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=2407)|
| 0:40:13| The makeup of the board of directors, you and I had discussed about how the county has six| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=2413)|
| 0:40:18| and the city has three independent members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=2418)|
| 0:40:20| And then also in terms of the money that's being put forth by the county and the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=2420)|
| 0:40:25| and the majority of the venues, if not all the venues, are in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=2425)|
| 0:40:29| Could you just give a little bit of history of why that's divided up the way it is and the money situation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=2429)|
| 0:40:35| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=2435)|
| 0:40:36| I can speak of the makeup of the board, and then I'll ask Jim York to speak on the funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=2436)|
| 0:40:40| But if you see, the city has three positions on the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=2440)|
| 0:40:44| The county has six.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=2444)|
| 0:40:46| And it's like I said today, you know, the county will contribute a larger percentage of the money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=2446)|
| 0:40:51| so they do have more seats on the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=2451)|
| 0:40:54| And then Jim will explain how the funding all comes together, the breakout on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=2454)|
| 0:41:05| Jim York, finance director for the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=2465)|
| 0:41:09| In terms of the way this is financed, this is all financed through a combination of hotel-motel tax| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=2469)|
| 0:41:17| or funding equivalent to city hotel-motel tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=2477)|
| 0:41:22| And if we look at what the county hotel-motel tax is, and that's a 5% tax on occupancy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=2482)|
| 0:41:29| that's about $5.86 million per year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=2489)|
| 0:41:35| That's what our estimate would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=2495)|
| 0:41:37| And out of that, 40% has to go to a tourism organization or a DMO.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=2497)|
| 0:41:45| And that's the county share.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=2505)|
| 0:41:47| That would be around $2.27 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=2507)|
| 0:41:51| For us, we're at about $568,000 on our city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=2511)|
| 0:41:56| All of the county hotel-motel tax has to be used for tourism-related activities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=2516)|
| 0:42:05| And so, again, 40% has to go to a tourism organization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=2525)|
| 0:42:10| In terms of our city hotel-motel tax, we estimate that at around $2.67 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=2530)|
| 0:42:21| And if they were to get the maximum allotment based on meeting the standards, that would yield about $373,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=2541)|
| 0:42:31| Again, these are all estimates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=2551)|
| 0:42:34| The city's share would be roughly $942,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=2554)|
| 0:42:38| And that would be the maximum, again, if these numbers come in as forecast.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=2558)|
| 0:42:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=2567)|
| 0:42:48| The way the county hotel-motel tax is broken down is, and I want to give this in percentages,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=2568)|
| 0:42:54| is 10% comes to the city, and that's the piece that we're using for Visit Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=2574)|
| 0:43:00| The other 10% goes to the county, and they can use it for tourism-related activities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=2580)|
| 0:43:06| Forty percent, again, goes to tourism Visit Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=2586)|
| 0:43:11| The other 40% is split.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=2591)|
| 0:43:14| The county, by agreement, has agreed to give the city $1.5 million to go towards debt service on the convention center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=2594)|
| 0:43:24| And then the balance goes to, again, to the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=2604)|
| 0:43:27| and I think they use it for debt service on some tourism facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=2607)|
| 0:43:31| But that's how it's broken down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=2611)|
| 0:43:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=2618)|
| 0:43:39| I would like to just thank Eddie Maness for his leadership throughout this entire process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=2619)|
| 0:43:45| and Boyce Evans, Chip Berry, Janice McClellan, perhaps there were others,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=2625)|
| 0:43:50| I know they were key members of the team that handled this, I think, in a very professional way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=2630)|
| 0:43:56| a very unbiased way to review the proposals and to work on this contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=2636)|
| 0:44:04| And, of course, we appreciate the cooperation, as Councilman Wallace mentioned, with the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=2644)|
| 0:44:09| I also want to add that I, as mayor, I get invited to the convention center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=2649)|
| 0:44:14| and other places quite often to welcome groups that come to Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=2654)|
| 0:44:19| and I can't tell you how many positive remarks I have heard from people in the last five months| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=2659)|
| 0:44:27| or whatever about the staff of Visit Knoxville and what a great job they did| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=2667)|
| 0:44:32| in making their conference or convention a success.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=2672)|

| 0:44:41| how well through this tough transition they performed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=2681)|
| 0:44:44| and that going forward it will also be excellent service for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=2684)|

| 0:47:46| Yes, we've got the chief here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=2866)|
| 0:47:47| I just wondered if you would tell us just briefly about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=2867)|
| 0:47:50| I understand you used Helen Ross McNabb to help deal with folks who have either drug issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=2870)|
| 0:47:56| or mental health issues, instead of running them through the prison system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=2876)|
| 0:48:00| getting them some positive health.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=2880)|
| 0:48:02| But would you rebound on that a little bit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=2882)|
| 0:48:05| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=2885)|
| 0:48:06| What we do with this grant is it's actually for we focused it in on women,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=2886)|
| 0:48:13| and we're working with Helen Ross McNabb in identifying high-risk individuals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=2893)|
| 0:48:17| who are repeat misdemeanors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=2897)|
| 0:48:20| And so what their goal is is to get them out of that revolving door| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=2900)|
| 0:48:25| because of co-occurring disorders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=2905)|
| 0:48:27| And so that would be mental health and a substance abuse issue both,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=2907)|
| 0:48:32| which causes them to continue in this spiral.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=2912)|
| 0:48:35| So what we've done is through the courts with the DA's office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=2915)|
| 0:48:39| and the public defender's office is identify a core group,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=2919)|
| 0:48:42| and they're working with those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=2922)|
| 0:48:43| They assign a case manager to each of those ladies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=2923)|
| 0:48:47| and they're working with them to get their lives in order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=2927)|
| 0:48:50| Trying to break the cycle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=2930)|

| 0:49:56| Dale, I don't know if you're still here or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=2996)|
| 0:49:58| but this is one way of helping to fund that operation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=2998)|
| 0:50:02| Is that fair to say?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=3002)|
| 0:50:05| That's put out a request for proposal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=3005)|
| 0:50:08| and had two potential bidders that attended the pre-bid meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=3008)|
| 0:50:12| Pepsi-Cola and Coca-Cola.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=3012)|
| 0:50:14| We only had one response, which was Coca-Cola.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=3014)|
| 0:50:17| We're in negotiation with the contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=3017)|
| 0:50:20| It's $50,000 in the first year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=3020)|
| 0:50:23| and that's for purchase of a new marquee signage there at the corner of Hall of Fame and Howard Baker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=3023)|
| 0:50:31| And we get $20,000 annually, years two through five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=3031)|
| 0:50:36| Total cash value of $130,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=3036)|
| 0:50:40| And then there will be $40,000 estimated value in revamped in-venue signage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=3040)|
| 0:50:47| improving the signage at our concession stands,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=3047)|
| 0:50:51| with $10,000 in marketing value,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=3051)|
| 0:50:54| which is advertising truck backs or in-store promotions, that type of stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=3054)|
| 0:50:59| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=3059)|
| 0:51:00| But, Dale, this helps fund your budget, in essence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=3060)|
| 0:51:02| to keep that building up and to provide the services that you do to the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=3062)|

| 0:52:23| Can you perhaps move your microphone down?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=3143)|

| 0:52:27| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=3147)|
| 0:52:29| In the breakdown of the budget, it talks about design fees and this sort of thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=3149)|
| 0:52:34| and I'm curious, what is PBA charging the city to do this work?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=3154)|
| 0:52:40| We are conferring in the back, and we'll see who's going to bring that answer to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=3160)|
| 0:52:47| Mr. York?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=3167)|

| 0:52:58| and construction of the original convention center, and it's part of that original contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=3178)|
| 0:53:04| So the $711,000 that we're getting from the insurance company goes totally to the repairs of the building?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=3184)|
| 0:53:10| This would be, again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=3190)|
| 0:53:11| Nothing going to PBA in this situation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=3191)|
| 0:53:14| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=3194)|

| 0:54:22| what is the city paying PBA to do this work?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=3262)|
| 0:54:27| David Graves, City Public Service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=3267)|
| 0:54:29| My home address is 2208 Fisher Place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=3269)|

| 0:54:43| Those fees are covered by the overhead that the city pays PBA for these minor projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=3283)|
| 0:54:48| So it's kind of part of having Mr. Gallion and Mr. Martin on staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=3288)|
| 0:54:52| so there is no additional fee for this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121030?start=3292)|
