| 2:54:04| any commercial development at the intersection of Hickey| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=10444)|
| 2:54:07| Road and Lovell Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=10447)|
| 2:54:11| If you'll just introduce yourself by name and address,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=10451)|
| 2:54:14| please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=10454)|
| 2:54:15| Deborah Van Meter, 8700 Darien Court, Knoxville 37922.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=10455)|
| 2:54:21| Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, for listening to us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=10461)|
| 2:54:23| in these statements tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=10463)|
| 2:54:25| I'm the new president of the Council of West Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=10465)|
| 2:54:27| Homeowners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=10467)|
| 2:54:28| And I just wanted to reiterate the fact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=10468)|
| 2:54:31| that these neighbors have been very enthusiastic and adamant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=10471)|
| 2:54:37| in their opposition to any change in this sector| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=10477)|
| 2:54:41| plan or the zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=10481)|
| 2:54:44| And as representative of the Council of West Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=10484)|
| 2:54:46| Homeowners, we respectfully ask that y'all deny this request| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=10486)|
| 2:54:50| and any other requests that might come up regarding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=10490)|
| 2:54:52| any change in the zoning of this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=10492)|
| 2:54:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=10495)|
| 2:54:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=10496)|
| 2:54:58| The applicant, you have three minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=10498)|
| 2:55:00| Rebuttal, if you so choose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=10500)|
| 2:55:04| You know, I guess it's the same scenario.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=10504)|
| 2:55:06| They're mad at me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=10506)|
| 2:55:07| I'm mad at John Deere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=10507)|
| 2:55:08| And so, you know, where do we go with this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=10508)|
| 2:55:10| You know, the same reason they're complaining to me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=10510)|
| 2:55:12| I'm complaining to John Deere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=10512)|
| 2:55:14| I find it kind of odd that they don't have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=10514)|
| 2:55:15| a problem with John Deere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=10515)|
| 2:55:16| But they have a problem with me when| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=10516)|
| 2:55:18| there's dust all over everywhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=10518)|
| 2:55:19| You know, there's noise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=10519)|
| 2:55:20| In fact, it's worse there than it is with what I'm doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=10520)|
| 2:55:23| But, you know, to each his own, I guess, whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=10523)|
| 2:55:28| Is commercial OB commercial, Mr. Law Director?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=10528)|
| 2:55:33| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=10533)|
| 2:55:34| That'd be office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=10534)|
| 2:55:37| The office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=10537)|
| 2:55:38| That'd be a separate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=10538)|
| 2:55:39| It's not commercial, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=10539)|
| 2:55:41| Not commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=10541)|
| 2:55:41| So I'm not asking for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=10541)|
| 2:55:42| It would be a different zoning request| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=10542)|
| 2:55:46| that you could, I believe, you could apply at MPC for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=10546)|
| 2:55:50| So again, my point is, I'm not saying commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=10550)|
| 2:55:53| I'm saying OB.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=10553)|
| 2:55:54| Everybody's happy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=10554)|
| 2:55:55| You know, John Deere can do their thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=10555)|
| 2:55:57| I'm OK with what I'm doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=10557)|
| 2:55:59| And the homeowners association, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=10559)|
| 2:56:02| the point that Greg made when I talked to him is, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=10562)|
| 2:56:04| this property is going to really be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=10564)|
| 2:56:07| rented by a low income type of person at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=10567)|
| 2:56:10| I mean, there's not really a quality family| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=10570)|
| 2:56:11| that's going to want to go in this property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=10571)|
| 2:56:14| and rent it with what's going on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=10574)|
| 2:56:16| So this property really would be better| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=10576)|
| 2:56:18| served with a lawyer's office or a title office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=10578)|
| 2:56:21| that's going to keep the property up a lot nicer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=10581)|
| 2:56:25| You know, everybody wins that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=10585)|
| 2:56:27| If you went with trying to change it to office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=10587)|
| 2:56:29| you still got to have a sector plan changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=10589)|
| 2:56:31| So we could not do anything with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=10591)|
| 2:56:34| I tried to sort that out with them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=10594)|
| 2:56:36| and I didn't, you know, he'd have to answer that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=10596)|
| 2:56:42| Buzz, would he need to initiate an entire new application| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=10602)|
| 2:56:47| to get office?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=10607)|
| 2:56:48| He would have to have a sector plan amendment and a rezoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=10608)|
| 2:56:51| on a new application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=10611)|
| 2:56:51| And he could do that as a new application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=10611)|
| 2:56:53| We don't need to act on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=10613)|
| 2:56:55| Well, you can recommend it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=10615)|
| 2:56:57| You can ask me as, you know, a citizen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=10617)|
| 2:56:58| I'm asking you to recommend it to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=10618)|
| 2:57:00| And then I don't have to pay for the rezoning again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=10620)|
| 2:57:02| I don't have to go through the whole process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=10622)|
| 2:57:04| I mean, I spent $1,400 here, $300 for the appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=10624)|
| 2:57:06| It doesn't look like it's going to go anywhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=10626)|
| 2:57:08| So, you know, that would move it forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=10628)|
| 2:57:11| where I don't have to go through the whole process again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=10631)|
| 2:57:14| Now, they can deny it, you know, again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=10634)|
| 2:57:15| I mean, I don't, you know, I'm not saying they can't,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=10635)|
| 2:57:18| but what I'm asking you to do is recommend| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=10638)|
| 2:57:20| that they look at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=10640)|
| 2:57:20| Buzz, if the commission were to ask, or Mark,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=10640)|
| 2:57:24| if we were to pass a resolution asking you all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=10644)|
| 2:57:29| to re-look at the sector plan and examine it as an office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=10649)|
| 2:57:33| would he have to pay for an additional application fee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=10653)|
| 2:57:38| or?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=10658)|
| 2:57:41| If you worded it so that the request was coming from you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=10661)|
| 2:57:45| as an initiation of a general plan amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=10665)|
| 2:57:50| and associated zonings, we would consider| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=10670)|
| 2:57:53| that to be your request, and there wouldn't be any fee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=10673)|
| 2:57:57| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=10677)|
| 2:57:59| But?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=10679)|
| 2:58:01| But we do not have an office request before us tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=10681)|
| 2:58:05| But this would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=10685)|
| 2:58:06| Before we go into any more questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=10686)|
| 2:58:08| I want to wrap this up as far as his three minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=10688)|
| 2:58:11| Sir, you've got about one minute left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=10691)|
| 2:58:14| I'm just saying, you know, let's be fair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=10694)|
| 2:58:16| You know, my neighbors want something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=10696)|
| 2:58:19| I need something, because my neighbors are affecting me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=10699)|
| 2:58:22| And so what I'm asking you for is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=10702)|
| 2:58:24| to find a common ground here that everybody's happy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=10704)|
| 2:58:28| And I'd like to actually grant to come up here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=10708)|
| 2:58:30| because he really hassled me last month| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=10710)|
| 2:58:33| about that they were grandfathering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=10713)|
| 2:58:35| And I'd like to get you his input of how| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=10715)|
| 2:58:37| he feels about this now, about John Deere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=10717)|
| 2:58:42| Commissioner Grant Rosenberg.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=10722)|
| 2:58:44| Well, I'll speak to it briefly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=10724)|
| 2:58:49| Grant, if you could just keep it really brief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=10729)|
| 2:58:51| I'll keep it briefly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=10731)|
| 2:58:52| We initially went out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=10732)|
| 2:58:54| We hadn't had a complaint about John Deere| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=10734)|
| 2:58:55| until we took action against Mr. Fusco.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=10735)|
| 2:58:57| That was the first time I'm aware of that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=10737)|
| 2:58:59| had a complaint about the John Deere landscaping business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=10739)|
| 2:59:03| Once again, we were pointed out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=10743)|
| 2:59:05| I talked to my inspector.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=10745)|
| 2:59:06| She had told me that it was grandfathered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=10746)|
| 2:59:08| The business had been there for 30 plus years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=10748)|
| 2:59:10| It has expanded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=10750)|
| 2:59:12| It is in violation, technically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=10752)|
| 2:59:14| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=10754)|
| 2:59:14| It's an accident.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=10754)|
| 2:59:15| Just to keep it short, Grant, I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=10755)|
| 2:59:17| going to ask that you inspect and make sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=10757)|
| 2:59:20| that the John Deere is operating within their allowed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=10760)|
| 2:59:25| We already are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=10765)|
| 2:59:25| And technically, they are out of compliance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=10765)|
| 2:59:28| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=10768)|
| 2:59:28| So you're on top of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=10768)|
| 2:59:30| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=10770)|
| 2:59:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=10771)|
| 2:59:31| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=10771)|
| 2:59:32| Now, the opposition, you have three minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=10772)|
| 2:59:34| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=10774)|
| 2:59:41| I question how appropriate it is at this time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=10781)|
| 2:59:44| to even consider this piece of property for OB.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=10784)|
| 2:59:48| Sometime in the next five years, Lovell Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=10788)|
| 2:59:50| is going to be widened from Pellissippi Parkway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=10790)|
| 2:59:53| to the big intersection at Ball Camp, Middlebrook Pike,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=10793)|
| 2:59:57| Hardin Valley area out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=10797)|
| 3:00:01| It was my understanding this property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=10801)|
| 3:00:02| is fairly big enough for any kind of business enterprise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=10802)|
| 3:00:05| to begin with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=10805)|
| 3:00:06| And who knows how much of this property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=10806)|
| 3:00:10| might get chopped off with the widening of Lovell Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=10810)|
| 3:00:12| Even part of our entrance may get chopped off, for all I know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=10812)|
| 3:00:16| I just question whether this is an appropriate thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=10816)|
| 3:00:19| to even consider at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=10819)|
| 3:00:24| Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=10824)|
| 3:00:24| I'm John Schoonmaker, 144 Tanrara Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=10824)|
| 3:00:29| And so that everybody is fully aware,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=10829)|
| 3:00:31| I serve on Knox County's Board of Zoning Appeals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=10831)|
| 3:00:36| I was at the MPC meeting in January,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=10836)|
| 3:00:41| appeared there prior to my appointment to the BZA| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=10841)|
| 3:00:44| as the president of the Council of West Knox County homeowners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=10844)|
| 3:00:47| So I want everybody to understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=10847)|
| 3:00:49| that also, if this goes to the next level of appeal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=10849)|
| 3:00:53| it would not be heard in front of the Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=10853)|
| 3:00:56| Board of Zoning Appeals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=10856)|
| 3:00:59| Couple of quick things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=10859)|
| 3:01:00| One, I don't think you're setting a precedence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=10860)|
| 3:01:03| that the county commission should| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=10863)|
| 3:01:05| direct how a piece of property is being rezoned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=10865)|
| 3:01:08| I want you to think seriously about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=10868)|
| 3:01:11| Number two is that when the applicant purchased| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=10871)|
| 3:01:16| the property, he certainly had to be fully aware| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=10876)|
| 3:01:18| that it was zoned RA, which is residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=10878)|
| 3:01:21| and for residential uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=10881)|
| 3:01:23| If he wasn't aware of that, then that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=10883)|
| 3:01:26| not the community's problem that he didn't realize and do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=10886)|
| 3:01:29| his due diligence to find out what he could do and not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=10889)|
| 3:01:31| do on his property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=10891)|
| 3:01:33| I think if you look at the map, you'll| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=10893)|
| 3:01:35| see it is completely surrounded by residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=10895)|
| 3:01:39| except for the one agricultural area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=10899)|
| 3:01:41| Agricultural designation and RA are two separate issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=10901)|
| 3:01:46| We're talking about a piece of property that's zoned RA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=10906)|
| 3:01:51| He's already stated to you, and I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=10911)|
| 3:01:53| believe if I'm not trying to put words in Commissioner Lambert's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=10913)|
| 3:01:56| mouth, but he said that this was a Sanford and Son| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=10916)|
| 3:01:59| operation, and that most likely this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=10919)|
| 3:02:02| should be denied because of the current condition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=10922)|
| 3:02:05| of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=10925)|
| 3:02:06| You have one minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=10926)|
| 3:02:07| So I would request that you deny this rezoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=10927)|
| 3:02:13| and we'll move forward from there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=10933)|
| 3:02:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=10936)|
| 3:02:19| Debra Van Meter, 8700 Darien Court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=10939)|
| 3:02:22| There also seem to be a lot of potential uses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=10942)|
| 3:02:27| of this property being thrown out by the property owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=10947)|
| 3:02:32| I understand there is a for sale sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=10952)|
| 3:02:35| There's a for rent sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=10955)|
| 3:02:36| There are advertising postings for his business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=10956)|
| 3:02:44| and other assorted things that are for sale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=10964)|
| 3:02:47| If this was changed, even coming back as an office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=10967)|
| 3:02:51| I hope you all realize that we don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=10971)|
| 3:02:52| know what this gentleman has for in store for this property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=10972)|
| 3:02:56| and I hope you all consider that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=10976)|
| 3:02:58| Deny this appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=10978)|
| 3:02:59| Deny any further motions to rehear this by NPC or you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=10979)|
| 3:03:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=10985)|
| 3:03:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=10985)|
| 3:03:06| Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=10986)|
| 3:03:10| Sir, I do feel for your situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=10990)|
| 3:03:14| You've got a piece of property that is not necessarily| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=10994)|
| 3:03:17| usable by you at this time, and while I would probably| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=10997)|
| 3:03:21| be more inclined to support something like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=11001)|
| 3:03:23| I don't know, a beauty salon, some kind of neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=11003)|
| 3:03:28| business that serves the neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=11008)|
| 3:03:31| I can't support this at this time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=11011)|
| 3:03:33| and there's a process that you have to go through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=11013)|
| 3:03:36| And part of that process is given these neighbors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=11016)|
| 3:03:40| their say, and given these neighbors their opposition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=11020)|
| 3:03:44| to appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=11024)|
| 3:03:45| So while I might not necessarily be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=11025)|
| 3:03:49| opposed to some sort of an office designation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=11029)|
| 3:03:53| I'm not at this time willing to send this to NPC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=11033)|
| 3:03:57| asking them to do something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=11037)|
| 3:03:59| You can do that, but you're going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=11039)|
| 3:04:01| to need to start at square one, just like before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=11041)|
| 3:04:05| And I would start by reaching out to these neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=11045)|
| 3:04:09| And with that, I bring the motion that we deny this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=11049)|
| 3:04:12| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=11052)|
| 3:04:16| No, sir, we've given you your time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=11056)|
| 3:04:19| unless the commissioner wishes to give it to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=11059)|
| 3:04:25| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=11065)|
| 3:04:27| Thank you, Mr. Vice Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=11067)|
| 3:04:29| I guess my question is to the local homeowners group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=11069)|
| 3:04:34| You made the statement that, and I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=11074)|
| 3:04:36| just trying to get an understanding going forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=11076)|
| 3:04:38| that you were opposed to any commercial development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=11078)|
| 3:04:43| in your area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=11083)|
| 3:04:44| So I guess my question is, if once Grant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=11084)|
| 3:04:47| does his due diligence, it sounds like John Deere,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=11087)|
| 3:04:50| even though you like them, they're OK with you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=11090)|
| 3:04:53| they're operating legally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=11093)|
| 3:04:55| Once they're officially given notification| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=11095)|
| 3:04:59| that they are operating outside the parameters of how| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=11099)|
| 3:05:02| they should be running a business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=11102)|
| 3:05:04| well, an entity in the agriculture area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=11104)|
| 3:05:07| are you planning on opposing continued operations?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=11107)|
| 3:05:14| I guess that's my issue, or my question to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=11114)|
| 3:05:18| Do you oppose commercial, or do you oppose this personal one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=11118)|
| 3:05:23| And I agree, this is not a good place to develop a business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=11123)|
| 3:05:32| But once John Deere, if John Deere| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=11132)|
| 3:05:34| is deemed operating a commercial entity, if that is the case,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=11134)|
| 3:05:39| are you going to oppose John Deere, bottom line?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=11139)|
| 3:05:44| It's, I mean, and I know you probably| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=11144)|
| 3:05:48| can't speak for the entire entity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=11148)|
| 3:05:50| but you are the president.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=11150)|
| 3:05:52| I don't know how to answer that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=11152)|
| 3:05:53| John Deere was there when our center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=11153)|
| 3:05:56| No, not selling bobcats and mugs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=11156)|
| 3:05:59| OK, John Deere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=11159)|
| 3:06:00| I don't know what they were selling when| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=11160)|
| 3:06:02| the business developed, I said other nursery items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=11162)|
| 3:06:07| Well, in general, in general, if they're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=11167)|
| 3:06:11| deemed to be commercial, if the entities deem| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=11171)|
| 3:06:15| them to be commercial in an agricultural zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=11175)|
| 3:06:21| it may be an unfair question to ask them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=11181)|
| 3:06:23| I think that's unfair, because that's a supposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=11183)|
| 3:06:27| Well, no, it's Mr. Rosenberg has already| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=11187)|
| 3:06:30| said that they're operating legally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=11190)|
| 3:06:32| I mean, that's, I think, is a statement of fact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=11192)|
| 3:06:34| That should take care of itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=11194)|
| 3:06:36| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=11196)|
| 3:06:37| It should take care of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=11197)|
| 3:06:39| I would just hope that you come out against it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=11199)|
| 3:06:42| Why would it take care of itself?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=11202)|
| 3:06:43| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=11203)|
| 3:06:48| You know, my main question here is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=11208)|
| 3:06:52| going back to Mr. Fusco's request| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=11212)|
| 3:06:55| that we ask MPC to rezone this office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=11215)|
| 3:07:00| and try to get around, in other words, paying another fee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=11220)|
| 3:07:05| I think we'd be setting a terrible precedent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=11225)|
| 3:07:08| because that's not our job here in this commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=11228)|
| 3:07:11| I don't think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=11231)|
| 3:07:13| Our job is to take these things when| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=11233)|
| 3:07:14| they come to us from commission, not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=11234)|
| 3:07:17| to try to do the commission's job, MPC's job,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=11237)|
| 3:07:20| before they get to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=11240)|
| 3:07:24| Commissioner Broyles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=11244)|
| 3:07:27| When did you buy this property, sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=11247)|
| 3:07:31| I'm so glad you asked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=11251)|
| 3:07:34| I have two answers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=11254)|
| 3:07:35| One is two years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=11255)|
| 3:07:36| Second answer is, can I get my $300 back for the appeal?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=11256)|
| 3:07:39| Because obviously, this didn't mean anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=11259)|
| 3:07:46| I would like to follow up on something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=11266)|
| 3:07:48| Mr. Commissioner McKenzie said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=11268)|
| 3:07:52| I'm a little disturbed that you all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=11272)|
| 3:07:55| say that you don't have a problem with John Deere| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=11275)|
| 3:07:58| operating a commercial business right across the street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=11278)|
| 3:08:02| from your subdivision, but you do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=11282)|
| 3:08:04| have a problem with changing this to where it could be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=11284)|
| 3:08:08| I mean, I understand it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=11288)|
| 3:08:09| I don't think any commercial business should be there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=11289)|
| 3:08:11| either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=11291)|
| 3:08:13| But I would hope that you would oppose| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=11293)|
| 3:08:17| any kind of commercial development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=11297)|
| 3:08:19| and not just single out this one person,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=11299)|
| 3:08:21| because you don't happen to like what he's doing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=11301)|
| 3:08:24| but you do happen to like John Deere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=11304)|
| 3:08:27| I don't think that's appropriate or fair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=11307)|
| 3:08:30| Mr. LeBlanc.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=11310)|
| 3:08:33| OK, the motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=11313)|

| 3:08:40| I just want to make sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=11320)|
| 3:08:42| Motion on the floor is to deny the appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=11322)|

| 3:08:55| I think we're going to go back to our resolution 919, page 15.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=11335)|
| 3:09:03| We're back on regular agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=11343)|
| 3:09:07| Resolution 919 is declaring that the Knox County Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=11347)|
| 3:09:10| will not tolerate any action or behavior that intimidates,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=11350)|

| 3:09:25| And what was that amendment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=11365)|
| 3:09:28| To include the word, phrase, county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=11368)|
| 3:09:32| So we are adding that we behave ourselves| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=11372)|
| 3:09:35| to commissioners as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=11375)|
| 3:09:36| Is that what you're saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=11376)|
| 3:09:37| Something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=11377)|

| 3:09:47| I want to go down as a co-sponsor of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=11387)|

| 3:10:49| OK, ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=11449)|
| 3:10:51| The next item is resolution 923 that was added.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=11451)|
| 3:10:55| It is regarding proceeds from the sale of surplus property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=11455)|
| 3:10:59| of the Knox County Schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=11459)|
| 3:11:02| Make a motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=11462)|
| 3:11:04| Do I hear a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=11464)|
| 3:11:04| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=11464)|
| 3:11:07| OK, Commissioner Norman, you were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=11467)|
| 3:11:08| going to want to make a comment about something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=11468)|
| 3:11:10| other than this item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=11470)|
| 3:11:14| On the previous item on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=11474)|
| 3:11:16| Could we take care of this first?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=11476)|
| 3:11:17| Sure, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=11477)|
| 3:11:18| We'll come back to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=11478)|
| 3:11:19| I just want to make sure we just, I'll come back to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=11479)|
| 3:11:21| Commissioner Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=11481)|
| 3:11:23| Yeah, I just had a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=11483)|
| 3:11:25| The way I read this resolution is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=11485)|
| 3:11:29| that we would take the proceeds from the sale of the school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=11489)|
| 3:11:32| property and give it to the schools just to use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=11492)|
| 3:11:35| or what was your intent?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=11495)|
| 3:11:36| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=11496)|
| 3:11:37| Mr. Briggs, I had a resolution passed here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=11497)|
| 3:11:39| I guess it's been a year or two ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=11499)|
| 3:11:42| to try to get the schools to turn over this surplus| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=11502)|
| 3:11:44| property before it got in such bad shape| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=11504)|
| 3:11:45| we couldn't get any money from it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=11505)|
| 3:11:48| If they would turn it over, that we would give the money back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=11508)|
| 3:11:50| to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=11510)|
| 3:11:52| The commission voted on it, but there were some stipulations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=11512)|
| 3:11:55| on it that I didn't know that we were trying to tell them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=11515)|
| 3:11:57| what to do with the money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=11517)|
| 3:11:59| And I don't think we need to be telling them what to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=11519)|
| 3:12:01| especially in this time and need right now with the budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=11521)|
| 3:12:03| as tight as it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=11523)|
| 3:12:05| I think we need to let them make those decisions instead| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=11525)|
| 3:12:08| of us micromanaging.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=11528)|
| 3:12:11| And we had already voted for the resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=11531)|
| 3:12:14| to give them the money from surplus property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=11534)|
| 3:12:19| You know, I guess my only question is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=11539)|
| 3:12:21| and I don't disagree with what you're saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=11541)|
| 3:12:23| and I think it's a good idea, but this is, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=11543)|
| 3:12:28| these are capital assets that we're selling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=11548)|
| 3:12:31| And I guess my only question is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=11551)|
| 3:12:33| is should we be using those capital assets to reduce some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=11553)|
| 3:12:37| of the school debt rather than using it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=11557)|
| 3:12:39| for operational expenses?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=11559)|
| 3:12:40| It's not to reduce the school debt, Mr. Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=11560)|
| 3:12:43| You'll read this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=11563)|
| 3:12:44| It's to let the school system use it at their discretion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=11564)|
| 3:12:47| to what they feel like they need to use it for at the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=11567)|
| 3:12:50| That's what he's saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=11570)|
| 3:12:53| He disagrees with the concept of using capital funds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=11573)|
| 3:12:55| for ongoing expenses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=11575)|
| 3:12:57| Well, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=11577)|
| 3:12:58| No, it's not necessarily that they're going to spend it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=11578)|
| 3:12:59| on the ongoing expense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=11579)|
| 3:13:01| I mean, it's their discretion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=11581)|
| 3:13:03| Dr. Briggs, would you like to explain yourself?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=11583)|
| 3:13:06| No, I just, I guess what I'm saying is that in general,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=11586)|
| 3:13:09| if we sell excess property, whether it's school property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=11589)|
| 3:13:12| or whether it's county property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=11592)|
| 3:13:14| do we want to have the option even there to use it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=11594)|
| 3:13:18| for everyday operational expenses?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=11598)|
| 3:13:21| And the reason is, is once those funds are spent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=11601)|
| 3:13:24| they're gone, or do we want to use money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=11604)|
| 3:13:27| from where you sell a capital asset to reduce the debt| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=11607)|
| 3:13:31| on other capital assets?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=11611)|
| 3:13:33| I guess is what I'm trying to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=11613)|
| 3:13:35| In other words, you're wishing to direct those proceeds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=11615)|
| 3:13:39| instead of just allowing the school board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=11619)|
| 3:13:42| to their discretion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=11622)|
| 3:13:47| We may not be able to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=11627)|
| 3:13:49| Let me tell you something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=11629)|
| 3:13:50| That's exactly what the old resolution says.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=11630)|
| 3:13:53| I mean, we may not be able to do that, and that we can't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=11633)|
| 3:13:55| There's a resolution in place now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=11635)|
| 3:13:58| that this commission previously passed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=11638)|
| 3:14:00| that says that when surplus school property is sold,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=11640)|
| 3:14:05| that the proceeds will go back to the school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=11645)|
| 3:14:08| but that it'll be used for the specific purpose of going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=11648)|
| 3:14:13| to physical plant improvements or capital projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=11653)|
| 3:14:19| That's what the resolution currently provides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=11659)|
| 3:14:22| The resolution on the floor would remove that restriction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=11662)|

| 3:16:23| by any means, but some billboard space that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=11783)|

| 3:16:37| that they use some unused billboard space| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=11797)|
| 3:16:40| to support a very interesting public service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=11800)|

| 3:20:58| Ordinance 0-09-3-106 is to add a new section 1-11| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=12058)|

| 3:21:23| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=12083)|
| 3:21:25| Will you have a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=12085)|
| 3:21:26| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=12086)|
| 3:21:27| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=12087)|

| 3:21:57| Got a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=12117)|
| 3:21:58| Commissioner Hammond?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=12118)|
| 3:21:59| Question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=12119)|
| 3:21:59| Is it possible for us to require someone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=12119)|
| 3:22:02| to go through the server training program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=12122)|
| 3:22:04| and complete that before they start selling?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=12124)|
| 3:22:07| Mr. Law Director?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=12127)|
| 3:22:09| I'm going to ask Mr. Jarrett to address this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=12129)|
| 3:22:15| That's certainly permissible, members of the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=12135)|
| 3:22:17| However, as written, as you recall,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=12137)|
| 3:22:19| there was a debate amongst the beer inspectors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=12139)|
| 3:22:22| as whether or not they should have between 30 and 60 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=12142)|
| 3:22:26| You would be amending the ordinance as currently written,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=12146)|
| 3:22:29| which provides a time frame in which to complete the server| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=12149)|
| 3:22:32| training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=12152)|
| 3:22:34| Would that be considered a major change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=12154)|
| 3:22:36| or that we could still vote on on second reading?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=12156)|
| 3:22:39| Or would it put us back to a first reading?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=12159)|
| 3:22:43| Well, considering the fact that presently they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=12163)|
| 3:22:49| do have that proverbial buffer, that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=12169)|
| 3:22:51| would be a pretty substantial change,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=12171)|
| 3:22:53| I think, that would require you to go back to first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=12173)|
| 3:22:56| I don't necessarily want to do that, but like today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=12176)|
| 3:22:59| most of the issues we have are with new people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=12179)|
| 3:23:01| or it appears that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=12181)|
| 3:23:02| And it would just seem to me that if they had to complete it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=12182)|
| 3:23:05| before they could start serving, that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=12185)|
| 3:23:07| might be a way to eliminate some of these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=12187)|
| 3:23:09| But I don't want to make a substantial change right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=12189)|
| 3:23:12| There's something we could look at maybe down the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=12192)|
| 3:23:14| Well, Commissioner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=12194)|
| 3:23:15| I'd like to point out that I made that suggestion when we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=12195)|
| 3:23:18| were having this discussion last month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=12198)|
| 3:23:21| And in fact, there was, I think, a little bit of discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=12201)|
| 3:23:26| about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=12206)|
| 3:23:27| And the general consensus around the table| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=12207)|
| 3:23:31| was that that was going to put too much of a burden| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=12211)|
| 3:23:34| on the business owner to have their employees complete| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=12214)|
| 3:23:38| this training before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=12218)|
| 3:23:41| And I disagreed then, and I still disagree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=12221)|
| 3:23:44| I think that they should have to complete the training before| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=12224)|
| 3:23:47| they're allowed to sell any alcohol.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=12227)|
| 3:23:50| Are you wishing to make that change?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=12230)|
| 3:23:52| No, I said I tried to make it last month and was voted down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=12232)|
| 3:23:57| Unless there's been substantial change in commission's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=12237)|
| 3:24:01| mindset between then and now, I still think it's a good idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=12241)|
| 3:24:05| I'd like to make that change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=12245)|
| 3:24:08| If we can, Joe, can we do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=12248)|
| 3:24:10| We'd have to go back to first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=12250)|
| 3:24:13| I think it's worth it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=12253)|
| 3:24:14| From what we've seen today, it's worth it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=12254)|
| 3:24:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=12257)|
| 3:24:18| I think so, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=12258)|
| 3:24:19| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=12259)|
| 3:24:22| If you're done, Commissioner Burroughs, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=12262)|
| 3:24:24| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=12264)|
| 3:24:26| I would just like to say in partial answer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=12266)|
| 3:24:29| to Mr. Hammond's question a moment ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=12269)|
| 3:24:35| Joe and I have talked several times about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=12275)|
| 3:24:38| There are still some areas that we'll continue to need tweaking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=12278)|
| 3:24:41| We need to streamline it a little bit more,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=12281)|
| 3:24:43| the process and what it is, and that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=12283)|
| 3:24:45| what we're going to be working on, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=12285)|
| 3:24:48| Little things, but like having a fast-track sheet to hand them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=12288)|
| 3:24:56| when they come up to apply, so this is what you need to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=12296)|
| 3:24:59| 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=12299)|
| 3:25:02| And for instance, as we saw today here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=12302)|
| 3:25:06| and there was evidence that some people don't understand when| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=12306)|
| 3:25:09| we find them that we find them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=12309)|
| 3:25:12| There's nothing that says that Mr. Monick can't have a sheet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=12312)|
| 3:25:15| there that says, sir, you've just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=12315)|
| 3:25:17| been served with $500 fines, and you've got seven days to pay it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=12317)|
| 3:25:21| He puts his hand right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=12321)|
| 3:25:23| I mean, there's a lot of things we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=12323)|
| 3:25:24| can do to make this process move a little smoother.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=12324)|
| 3:25:30| Chairman, I have a point of information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=12330)|
| 3:25:33| Is the motion on the floor now amended| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=12333)|
| 3:25:36| to include the finish the training provision yet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=12336)|
| 3:25:39| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=12339)|
| 3:25:39| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=12339)|
| 3:25:41| I would like to amend it to include the finish training| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=12341)|
| 3:25:43| provision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=12343)|
| 3:25:44| Do I hear a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=12344)|
| 3:25:46| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=12346)|
| 3:25:47| Or does the maker of the motion wish| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=12347)|
| 3:25:49| to accept that as a change?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=12349)|
| 3:25:51| Who made the motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=12351)|
| 3:25:52| Commissioner Norton made it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=12352)|
| 3:25:54| Do you wish to just accept that as a change?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=12354)|
| 3:25:55| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=12355)|
| 3:25:56| OK, just a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=12356)|
| 3:25:57| Commissioner Smith was a second, and he accepts that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=12357)|
| 3:26:00| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=12360)|
| 3:26:01| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=12361)|
| 3:26:02| So this will be a ordinance on first reading| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=12362)|
| 3:26:06| with this change in the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=12366)|
| 3:26:08| Everybody understand that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=12368)|
| 3:26:09| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=12369)|
| 3:26:10| Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=12370)|
| 3:26:12| Mr. Law Director, isn't there a time limit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=12372)|
| 3:26:16| that we have to have adopted this by a certain time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=12376)|
| 3:26:19| I'm wondering if throwing this back to first reading| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=12379)|
| 3:26:23| will affect that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=12383)|
| 3:26:26| I don't believe there is a time limit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=12386)|
| 3:26:28| Mr. Jarrett, are we operating under a time limitation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=12388)|
| 3:26:31| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=12391)|
| 3:26:32| And again, of course, we'll defer to the wisdom| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=12392)|
| 3:26:34| of the board here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=12394)|
| 3:26:35| My only concern is you're once again| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=12395)|
| 3:26:38| going to be restricting yourselves| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=12398)|
| 3:26:39| to the fines and penalties and the enforcement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=12399)|
| 3:26:42| that you've been seeking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=12402)|
| 3:26:45| We can always bring this back and amend it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=12405)|
| 3:26:48| But at this point, you realize for the next two months,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=12408)|
| 3:26:50| you'll once again go back to your original penalty scheme.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=12410)|
| 3:26:53| And that's my only concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=12413)|
| 3:26:54| Again, that's a policy issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=12414)|
| 3:26:55| And as long as the board's aware of that, of course,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=12415)|
| 3:26:57| we won't interject.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=12417)|
| 3:26:59| OK, I'm going to make the substitute motion that we go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=12419)|
| 3:27:02| back to the original motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=12422)|
| 3:27:05| I do support what you're wanting to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=12425)|
| 3:27:07| And I'll support it next month when| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=12427)|
| 3:27:09| we do it as a separate issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=12429)|
| 3:27:11| But I really think we need to get on this program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=12431)|
| 3:27:16| Do I hear a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=12436)|
| 3:27:17| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=12437)|
| 3:27:18| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=12438)|
| 3:27:18| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=12438)|
| 3:27:21| So the substitute motion is to approve it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=12441)|
| 3:27:25| as written originally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=12445)|
| 3:27:27| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=12447)|
| 3:27:28| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=12448)|
| 3:27:30| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=12450)|
| 3:27:31| Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=12451)|
| 3:27:33| My only concern is, does anybody in the room| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=12453)|
| 3:27:34| know how often that the Sheriff's Office puts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=12454)|
| 3:27:36| on the ASK program?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=12456)|
| 3:27:38| Because let's say they put it on the last Thursday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=12458)|
| 3:27:43| When you hire a guy the first week of the month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=12463)|
| 3:27:45| he can't go to the class.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=12465)|
| 3:27:47| So I think we need to find that out before we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=12467)|
| 3:27:49| put that in the order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=12469)|
| 3:27:50| I agree with that, totally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=12470)|
| 3:27:52| But I think we need to find out the availability of the ASK| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=12472)|
| 3:27:54| class before we determine if we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=12474)|
| 3:27:58| going to put a time stipulation on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=12478)|
| 3:28:00| Because the availability, I believe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=12480)|
| 3:28:01| at the city is twice a week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=12481)|
| 3:28:03| And I don't know what it is at the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=12483)|
| 3:28:05| And there's a waiting list to get in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=12485)|
| 3:28:06| At the city, if you're not the first 50 or 30 to get in there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=12486)|
| 3:28:09| you're out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=12489)|
| 3:28:10| And so putting this time limit on there is a great idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=12490)|
| 3:28:13| But we need to make sure that we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=12493)|
| 3:28:14| offering the class enough to where the employees have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=12494)|
| 3:28:16| the opportunity to take it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=12496)|
| 3:28:17| I think some companies do their own.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=12497)|
| 3:28:20| Pilot does, Food City does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=12500)|
| 3:28:22| They're certified to do their own ASK program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=12502)|
| 3:28:24| That's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=12504)|
| 3:28:25| But everybody that was in here today was mom and pop,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=12505)|
| 3:28:26| except for one Kroger store.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=12506)|
| 3:28:28| If Pilot or Food City will let them come in and charge them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=12508)|
| 3:28:31| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=12511)|
| 3:28:33| Commissioner Pinkston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=12513)|
| 3:28:34| Does it cost to send these people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=12514)|
| 3:28:36| these employees to this school?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=12516)|
| 3:28:39| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=12519)|
| 3:28:39| I believe it's $30 or $40, maybe more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=12519)|
| 3:28:42| But they have to pay for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=12522)|
| 3:28:43| A lot of people have never been in business before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=12523)|
| 3:28:45| especially on this commission year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=12525)|
| 3:28:48| But I have actually hired people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=12528)|
| 3:28:50| They come to work and work one day, and boom, they're gone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=12530)|
| 3:28:53| They decide not to come back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=12533)|
| 3:28:55| So I'm going to have to support it the way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=12535)|
| 3:28:57| it's originally written here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=12537)|
| 3:29:00| I don't want to be paying for people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=12540)|
| 3:29:01| that aren't going to work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=12541)|
| 3:29:06| Commissioner Broyles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=12546)|
| 3:29:10| As strange as it may seem, I'm going to agree with Lumpy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=12550)|
| 3:29:13| on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=12553)|
| 3:29:15| That I want to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=12555)|
| 3:29:16| This has been a strange day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=12556)|
| 3:29:17| It has.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=12557)|
| 3:29:19| I would like to see us go ahead and pass the beer ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=12559)|
| 3:29:21| so that we can go ahead and have access to the stronger| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=12561)|
| 3:29:24| penalties that we've been looking for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=12564)|
| 3:29:27| And I can bring this back as an amendment next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=12567)|
| 3:29:33| And Brad, we can check into when classes are offered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=12573)|
| 3:29:36| And Paul, maybe we can have the business owners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=12576)|
| 3:29:42| deduct the cost from the employee's first paycheck| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=12582)|
| 3:29:44| or something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=12584)|
| 3:29:45| I don't think that we could require it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=12585)|
| 3:29:47| but they could always make that up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=12587)|
| 3:29:48| They can certainly do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=12588)|
| 3:29:49| They could do that on their own.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=12589)|
| 3:29:51| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=12591)|
| 3:29:53| One thing that we haven't mentioned here tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=12593)|
| 3:29:55| is that some three or four months ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=12595)|
| 3:29:57| we approved changing the hours so they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=12597)|
| 3:30:01| would coincide with the cities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=12601)|
| 3:30:03| And that's been held in abeyance because we've never| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=12603)|
| 3:30:06| approved the new laws.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=12606)|
| 3:30:07| We kept putting off, putting off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=12607)|
| 3:30:09| So that would be another good reason| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=12609)|
| 3:30:11| to go ahead and approve these as they are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=12611)|
| 3:30:13| And then let's make the sense this is on our mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=12613)|
| 3:30:16| Now we can make the amendments we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=12616)|
| 3:30:18| feel we need to make after we get it in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=12618)|
| 3:30:21| But as it's been brought out, we also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=12621)|
| 3:30:23| have access under the new rules to the stiffer penalties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=12623)|
| 3:30:26| if we want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=12626)|
| 3:30:27| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=12627)|
| 3:30:28| Motion on the floor is a substitute motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=12628)|
| 3:30:30| to pass it as it is originally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=12630)|
| 3:30:34| It makes it a second reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=12634)|
| 3:30:36| Everybody understand?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=12636)|
| 3:30:38| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=12638)|
| 3:30:39| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=12639)|
| 3:30:40| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=12640)|
| 3:30:41| Ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=12641)|
| 3:30:46| Turn around and around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=12646)|
| 3:31:02| We're on public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=12662)|
| 3:31:05| And we have our favorite guest, Brad Mays.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=12665)|
| 3:31:13| How you doing, everyone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=12673)|
| 3:31:14| And if you'll just give your name and address| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=12674)|
| 3:31:16| for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=12676)|
| 3:31:17| My name's Brad Mays.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=12677)|
| 3:31:18| I live at 1817 Plum Branch Road, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37932.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=12678)|
| 3:31:23| You all know what I'm here about every month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=12683)|
| 3:31:25| I'm just having a hard time getting documents still.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=12685)|
| 3:31:28| I finally, after a year, finally got 2003's green waste report| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=12688)|
| 3:31:33| that Knox County had the whole time and didn't turn over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=12693)|
| 3:31:36| And I got the 2007 real numbers, finally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=12696)|
| 3:31:40| Now, there's three last documents that I need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=12700)|
| 3:31:43| And they're the original John Evans biosolids reports.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=12703)|
| 3:31:46| They're EPA biosolids reports.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=12706)|
| 3:31:48| John done them for every year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=12708)|
| 3:31:50| Some of them are missing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=12710)|
| 3:31:53| A few of you commissioners know for a fact they exist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=12713)|
| 3:31:56| Mr. Salter admitted to Larry Vangilder of the Hall Shopper| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=12716)|
| 3:32:00| they exist, and even went into detail| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=12720)|
| 3:32:02| and told them what they said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=12722)|
| 3:32:04| I need copies of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=12724)|
| 3:32:05| They're public records.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=12725)|
| 3:32:06| And I'm going to reserve the remaining four minutes and 15| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=12726)|
| 3:32:09| seconds for rebuttal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=12729)|
| 3:32:18| Tom?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=12738)|
| 3:32:18| Mr. Salter, do you have anything you'd like to say?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=12738)|
| 3:32:22| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=12742)|
| 3:32:23| Tom, I'd like to ask you a question, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=12743)|
| 3:32:26| Why don't we do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=12746)|
| 3:32:32| This has come up before up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=12752)|
| 3:32:33| Did John file any EPA biosolids reports for three, four,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=12753)|
| 3:32:37| and five?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=12757)|
| 3:32:38| Not that I'm aware of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=12758)|
| 3:32:39| Not that you're aware of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=12759)|
| 3:32:42| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=12762)|
| 3:32:42| I got that from Rodney Rocket.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=12762)|
| 3:32:45| I mean, I wasn't there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=12765)|
| 3:32:47| I know you weren't there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=12767)|
| 3:32:48| And I've never seen any.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=12768)|
| 3:32:49| What did you get from Rodney Rocket?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=12769)|
| 3:32:51| Rodney said the first, they just weren't done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=12771)|
| 3:32:54| John didn't do them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=12774)|
| 3:32:57| Well, what did you tell Larry Van Gilder?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=12777)|
| 3:32:59| Nothing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=12779)|
| 3:33:00| I didn't talk to Larry Van Gilder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=12780)|
| 3:33:04| Sir, sir, we're not going to get into name callings, OK?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=12784)|
| 3:33:13| So Commissioner Pinkson, are you done?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=12793)|
| 3:33:19| Commissioner Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=12799)|
| 3:33:20| You know, I guess the question I have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=12800)|
| 3:33:22| do the documents exist?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=12802)|
| 3:33:27| And if they do exist, do we know where they are?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=12807)|
| 3:33:30| And if we don't know where they are, what happened to them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=12810)|
| 3:33:35| And then the question to the law director| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=12815)|
| 3:33:37| is, as it seems to me under the Open Meetings Act,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=12817)|
| 3:33:40| if they do exist and someone has them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=12820)|
| 3:33:41| they need to be turned over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=12821)|
| 3:33:44| That's a lot of questions, but.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=12824)|
| 3:33:47| I believe the gentleman just said that there weren't any.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=12827)|
| 3:33:53| Is that true?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=12833)|
| 3:33:56| When I came on board, that was the position of our department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=12836)|
| 3:34:01| Rodney Rocket was there with John.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=12841)|
| 3:34:03| He said John did not do them the first three years of the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=12843)|
| 3:34:08| And Rodney has asserted that under oath| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=12848)|
| 3:34:12| several times in depositions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=12852)|
| 3:34:16| So the answer to that is that they never existed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=12856)|
| 3:34:19| They never existed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=12859)|
| 3:34:20| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=12860)|
| 3:34:21| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=12861)|
| 3:34:24| Commissioner Briggs, are you done?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=12864)|
| 3:34:26| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=12866)|
| 3:34:26| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=12866)|
| 3:34:28| Well, you know, and Ms. Hawthorne, you can correct me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=12868)|
| 3:34:32| I worked for, well, I contracted to the US Department of Energy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=12872)|
| 3:34:39| And I would assume if anything was submitted to the EPA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=12879)|
| 3:34:43| the EPA would have copies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=12883)|
| 3:34:47| Does the EPA have copies, as you know of?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=12887)|
| 3:34:51| Not that I know of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=12891)|
| 3:34:54| I mean, because that Freedom of Information Act, all that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=12894)|
| 3:34:56| would be in the public record as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=12896)|
| 3:34:59| So I guess I'd challenge Mr. Mays to try| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=12899)|
| 3:35:02| to get them from the feds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=12902)|
| 3:35:05| I'm fairly confident if the Atlanta office or Nashville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=12905)|
| 3:35:10| office would ever receive that, that there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=12910)|
| 3:35:12| would be a chain to where we could get those records.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=12912)|
| 3:35:19| So I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=12919)|
| 3:35:23| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=12923)|
| 3:35:25| I'll give you one minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=12925)|
| 3:35:28| I personally witnessed Mr. Salter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=12928)|
| 3:35:30| talking to Larry Van Gilder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=12930)|
| 3:35:32| Larry Van Gilder can probably verify that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=12932)|
| 3:35:34| I asked him not to run the story because of the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=12934)|
| 3:35:37| But he was going to run a story about what Mr. Salter told him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=12937)|
| 3:35:40| I can verify these documents did exist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=12940)|
| 3:35:43| They were filed on file at the local TDEC office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=12943)|
| 3:35:46| They existed at least through May of 2007.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=12946)|
| 3:35:49| TDEC notified John Evans that he had worded them improperly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=12949)|
| 3:35:53| Because when I first saw them, the documents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=12953)|
| 3:35:55| said that the pathogen reduction requirements have not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=12955)|
| 3:35:58| been met at this facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=12958)|
| 3:36:00| I asked John Evans about them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=12960)|
| 3:36:02| And he said, oh, Rodney just worded them wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=12962)|
| 3:36:05| TDEC asked John Evans in writing to correct| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=12965)|
| 3:36:07| the wording of his EPA 503 certification statements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=12967)|
| 3:36:12| One week later, TDEC said they didn't exist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=12972)|
| 3:36:15| Now, how do you improperly word something that don't exist,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=12975)|
| 3:36:19| number one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=12979)|
| 3:36:20| And number two, how come Larry Van Gilder| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=12980)|
| 3:36:22| can tell you all for sure that Mr. Salter told him| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=12982)|
| 3:36:25| that John had done EPA biosolids reports,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=12985)|
| 3:36:28| that those reports said the pathogen requirements were not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=12988)|
| 3:36:31| met?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=12991)|
| 3:36:31| And Tom's explanation to Larry, the way I understood it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=12991)|
| 3:36:35| was that John Evans done them on the years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=12995)|
| 3:36:38| that they didn't sell material.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=12998)|
| 3:36:41| Now, I have a letter now from NRR| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=13001)|
| 3:36:44| saying they couldn't sell their material the first three years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=13004)|
| 3:36:48| And I promise you, there will be ironclad evidence of this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=13008)|
| 3:36:51| appear before long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=13011)|
| 3:36:53| But there are a few commissioners on this body| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=13013)|
| 3:36:56| that know for a fact those documents were filed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=13016)|
| 3:36:59| There are a few commissioners on this body| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=13019)|
| 3:37:01| that know exactly what they said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=13021)|
| 3:37:04| And I ask those commissioners, do you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=13024)|
| 3:37:06| see the deceit that has been told to me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=13026)|
| 3:37:09| for the past year and a half?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=13029)|
| 3:37:11| And you'll understand why I came here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=13031)|
| 3:37:13| This is withholding information concerning the public health.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=13033)|
| 3:37:18| We need these documents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=13038)|
| 3:37:19| And furthermore, why haven't the rest of the EPA?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=13039)|
| 3:37:23| These documents are required to be filed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=13043)|
| 3:37:24| Mr. Mays, I need you to wrap it up, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=13044)|
| 3:37:27| These documents are required to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=13047)|
| 3:37:28| filed by February the 19th of every year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=13048)|
| 3:37:31| for the preceding year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=13051)|
| 3:37:33| For the past two years, Mr. Salter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=13053)|
| 3:37:35| hasn't filed the remaining documents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=13055)|
| 3:37:38| We can get fined obscene amounts of money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=13058)|
| 3:37:41| for not having these documents on file for 07 and 08.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=13061)|
| 3:37:45| And he still hasn't certified whether or not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=13065)|
| 3:37:47| that material was safe to sell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=13067)|
| 3:37:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=13072)|
| 3:37:54| Mr. Smith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=13074)|
| 3:37:56| I just got something to just, I'm saying this as a citizen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=13076)|
| 3:38:00| and as a taxpayer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=13080)|
| 3:38:02| It's 9 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=13082)|
| 3:38:03| We started here at 2 o'clock or, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=13083)|
| 3:38:06| we've been meeting since 1130.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=13086)|
| 3:38:07| Well, we've been, but we hit the gavel down here at 2 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=13087)|
| 3:38:12| With billboard, 1230.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=13092)|
| 3:38:15| So we've been here seven hours, and I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=13095)|
| 3:38:17| see Mr. Salter's been here the whole time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=13097)|
| 3:38:20| That disturbs me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=13100)|
| 3:38:24| We haven't, Knox County hasn't got anything on Tom Salter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=13104)|
| 3:38:26| all day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=13106)|
| 3:38:27| He has sat in this audience all day long just, I guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=13107)|
| 3:38:31| to hear this or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=13111)|
| 3:38:33| You know, we as taxpayers, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=13113)|
| 3:38:36| Tom, I don't mean to be ragging on you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=13116)|
| 3:38:37| but Dad Jim, you've done nothing for Knox County all day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=13117)|
| 3:38:43| And every time we have these meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=13123)|
| 3:38:45| you're here to answer him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=13125)|
| 3:38:48| And if you're going to answer his, that's fine,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=13128)|
| 3:38:50| and we want you to answer those questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=13130)|
| 3:38:52| But get on a cell phone or something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=13132)|
| 3:38:54| and find out when you're supposed to be here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=13134)|
| 3:38:56| and let's get some production out of you for the day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=13136)|
| 3:38:59| I don't know if it's that month, but especially today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=13139)|
| 3:39:01| it's just sort of like, Tom, aren't you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=13141)|
| 3:39:03| going to do anything for us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=13143)|
| 3:39:05| I'm just, that's just a concern I've got.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=13145)|
| 3:39:07| I don't know who you work for or who your boss is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=13147)|
| 3:39:09| I'm assuming it's, you know, but anyway, it just disturbs me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=13149)|
| 3:39:12| I don't, I haven't seen anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=13152)|
| 3:39:15| I guess you've got an answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=13155)|
| 3:39:19| We finalized the selection of GPS tracking units| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=13159)|
| 3:39:24| this afternoon while I was here, and I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=13164)|
| 3:39:26| was involved in that decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=13166)|
| 3:39:28| So for our fleet of trucks with solid waste.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=13168)|
| 3:39:31| So I wasn't sitting here doing nothing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=13171)|
| 3:39:33| When was that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=13173)|
| 3:39:34| I mean, what, where did you do this at?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=13174)|
| 3:39:37| It was here in the hall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=13177)|
| 3:39:40| I mean, I went out and made a number of phone calls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=13180)|
| 3:39:43| So I mean, it happened during the day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=13183)|
| 3:39:45| I mean, I don't actually have to be in my office to work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=13185)|
| 3:39:51| Well, it's technology.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=13191)|
| 3:39:53| And I've been told I need to be here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=13193)|
| 3:39:56| if I have to answer a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=13196)|
| 3:39:58| Tonight there were questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=13198)|
| 3:39:59| And I was, I've been told that I need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=13199)|
| 3:40:01| to be here in the event a question comes up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=13201)|
| 3:40:04| And I know other department heads and whatnot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=13204)|
| 3:40:08| they're here, but I don't know, it just, it bothers me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=13208)|
| 3:40:14| I can understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=13214)|
| 3:40:15| Mr. Broyles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=13215)|
| 3:40:16| I can understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=13216)|
| 3:40:19| I can understand what you've done today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=13219)|
| 3:40:21| and that you can do a lot of your work by phone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=13221)|
| 3:40:23| I can understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=13223)|
| 3:40:25| I think it's late and everybody's blood sugar has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=13225)|
| 3:40:27| dropped and they're getting a little cranky.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=13227)|
| 3:40:29| And Tom, I appreciate all that you do for Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=13229)|
| 3:40:34| And I understand that you do a lot of work on your BlackBerry| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=13234)|
| 3:40:37| and via computer and all of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=13237)|
| 3:40:39| And maybe we should move public forum up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=13239)|
| 3:40:42| to the very beginning of our meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=13242)|
| 3:40:44| so that citizens don't have to sit around| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=13244)|
| 3:40:46| waiting for us either, you know?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=13246)|
| 3:40:49| Yeah, but I think it's hard for lots of department heads| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=13249)|
| 3:40:54| to have to sit here all day and endure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=13254)|
| 3:40:57| what we have voluntarily brought upon ourselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=13257)|
| 3:41:00| Mr. Broyles, I'm going to have to disagree with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=13260)|
| 3:41:02| I heard three apologies today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=13262)|
| 3:41:07| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=13267)|
| 3:41:08| I know everybody's anxious to go,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=13268)|
| 3:41:10| but we've got a whole page of discussion items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=13270)|
| 3:41:14| So y'all might as well just sit down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=13274)|
| 3:41:16| and let's go through these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=13276)|
| 3:41:19| First item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=13279)|
| 3:41:20| They're all on page 18.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=13280)|
| 3:41:22| The first one is discussion regarding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=13282)|
| 3:41:24| the terms of the members of the audit committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=13284)|
| 3:41:26| as it relates to ordinance 0-08-7-102.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=13286)|
| 3:41:30| Move to defer to the audit committee, which meets Thursday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=13290)|
| 3:41:35| Do I hear a second to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=13295)|
| 3:41:37| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=13297)|
| 3:41:40| Saunders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=13300)|
| 3:41:41| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=13301)|
| 3:41:42| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=13302)|
| 3:41:43| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=13303)|
| 3:41:43| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=13303)|
| 3:41:44| Ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=13304)|
| 3:41:45| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=13305)|
| 3:41:45| The next discussion item is regarding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=13305)|
| 3:41:47| the judicial commissioner appointment process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=13307)|
| 3:41:51| I believe we approved that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=13311)|
| 3:41:55| We did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=13315)|
| 3:41:56| Well, we approved the resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=13316)|
| 3:41:59| So Commissioner Norman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=13319)|
| 3:42:01| I don't have any discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=13321)|
| 3:42:04| Commissioner Norman, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=13324)|
| 3:42:06| Since there's no discussion, we're going to move on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=13326)|
| 3:42:09| Because there's nothing to vote on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=13329)|
| 3:42:11| Yeah, well, it's a discussion item, so there's nothing to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=13331)|
| 3:42:15| Mr. Lockett's made the recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=13335)|
| 3:42:17| We've accepted that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=13337)|
| 3:42:18| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=13338)|
| 3:42:19| You've got a light on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=13339)|
| 3:42:22| Mr. Brown, if you want to discuss it, go right ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=13342)|
| 3:42:30| By yourself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=13350)|
| 3:42:32| In this process for the judicial commissioners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=13352)|
| 3:42:34| I've had four or five already contact me regarding ones| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=13354)|
| 3:42:38| that will be coming up soon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=13358)|
| 3:42:40| I know what the resolution says about the judges giving us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=13360)|
| 3:42:46| at least four for each office that's open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=13366)|
| 3:42:50| But how do we get this word to all those that want to apply?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=13370)|
| 3:42:55| Rather than coming through us, now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=13375)|
| 3:42:57| they need to go through the judges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=13377)|
| 3:43:01| Joe Lee, did we put something out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=13381)|
| 3:43:03| We advertised.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=13383)|
| 3:43:06| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=13386)|
| 3:43:08| Commissioner Anders?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=13388)|
| 3:43:09| Yeah, in speaking with, spoke with the judge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=13389)|
| 3:43:13| the presiding judge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=13393)|
| 3:43:14| And the only question, when we passed the resolution today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=13394)|
| 3:43:17| on consent, that was my fault for not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=13397)|
| 3:43:20| asking the question then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=13400)|
| 3:43:21| But what if they don't have four qualified candidates?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=13401)|
| 3:43:25| Right now, they don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=13405)|
| 3:43:26| And so, I mean.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=13406)|
| 3:43:28| I guess they can only pass on the number that they have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=13408)|
| 3:43:31| What they're comfortable with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=13411)|
| 3:43:32| OK, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=13412)|
| 3:43:34| Thanks, Brad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=13414)|
| 3:43:34| That was my question, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=13414)|
| 3:43:36| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=13416)|
| 3:43:38| Two for one on that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=13418)|
| 3:43:40| Next discussion item is of recent charter amendments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=13420)|
| 3:43:42| and responsibilities of county officials| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=13422)|
| 3:43:44| regarding conflict of interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=13424)|
| 3:43:47| Mr. Chairman, I'd ask that this be put on because of the charter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=13427)|
| 3:43:49| amendment that was passed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=13429)|
| 3:43:50| I want to make sure that we fully understood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=13430)|
| 3:43:52| our duties and responsibilities under this charter amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=13432)|
| 3:43:54| so that we're not violating this charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=13434)|
| 3:43:57| And you told us that, well, let me let Mr. Lockett explain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=13437)|
| 3:44:00| There were two aspects to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=13440)|
| 3:44:04| On the amendment that passed, part of it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=13444)|
| 3:44:07| took effect immediately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=13447)|
| 3:44:08| Part of it, as far as reducing size of commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=13448)|
| 3:44:11| we know doesn't take effect until 2010.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=13451)|
| 3:44:14| The parts that took effect immediately upon passage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=13454)|
| 3:44:18| were the anti-nepotism policy and the conflict of interest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=13458)|
| 3:44:24| policy, which we discussed earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=13464)|
| 3:44:27| The conflict of interest policy has a definition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=13467)|
| 3:44:32| of personal interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=13472)|
| 3:44:34| And it applies, obviously, to someone who has a vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=13474)|
| 3:44:40| And if someone who has a vote, if their spouse or member| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=13480)|
| 3:44:47| of the immediate family is affected,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=13487)|
| 3:44:50| that falls within the definition of personal interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=13490)|
| 3:44:53| So in such an instance, not only must,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=13493)|
| 3:44:58| there is no discretion under the charter amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=13498)|
| 3:45:00| Under our ethics policy in the past,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=13500)|
| 3:45:04| when you had a conflict of interest that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=13504)|
| 3:45:09| keep in mind there are various conflicts of interest,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=13509)|
| 3:45:11| not just personal interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=13511)|
| 3:45:14| Someone had discretion as to whether they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=13514)|
| 3:45:17| could announce the conflict of interest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=13517)|
| 3:45:20| but still participate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=13520)|
| 3:45:22| But under the charter amendment, you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=13522)|
| 3:45:23| do not have that discretion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=13523)|
| 3:45:26| Someone must not only recuse themselves,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=13526)|
| 3:45:28| but as the example that took place earlier tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=13528)|
| 3:45:32| once they recuse themselves, if it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=13532)|
| 3:45:35| based on a personal interest conflict of interest,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=13535)|
| 3:45:39| cannot participate in debate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=13539)|
| 3:45:44| Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=13544)|
| 3:45:45| Mr. Lockett, when we get down to the budget, if it doesn't,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=13545)|
| 3:45:53| my wife is in the health department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=13553)|
| 3:45:56| can I not vote on the budget if it deals with a pay raise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=13556)|
| 3:45:58| or if it doesn't deal with her specifically?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=13558)|
| 3:46:02| Commissioner, to be safe, because really it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=13562)|
| 3:46:09| worded quite broadly, and I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=13569)|
| 3:46:12| that that would fall within the definition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=13572)|
| 3:46:15| of personal interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=13575)|
| 3:46:16| Well, I can't vote on the budget?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=13576)|
| 3:46:20| If it falls within the definition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=13580)|
| 3:46:23| of personal interest, then under the charter amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=13583)|
| 3:46:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=13589)|
| 3:46:31| Mr. Lockett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=13591)|
| 3:46:32| Mr. Lockett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=13592)|
| 3:46:34| Could we not take the budget department by department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=13594)|
| 3:46:37| though?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=13597)|
| 3:46:37| We don't have to vote on the budget as a whole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=13597)|
| 3:46:41| Because Commissioner Leuthold is going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=13601)|
| 3:46:43| to be in the same situation with the trustee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=13603)|
| 3:46:46| Commissioner Pinkson is going to be in the same situation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=13606)|
| 3:46:48| with the sheriff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=13608)|
| 3:46:49| I mean, can we not come in and take it department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=13609)|
| 3:46:51| by department rather than doing the budget as a whole?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=13611)|
| 3:46:54| And we may all be in under it, Commissioner Hammond,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=13614)|
| 3:46:57| if the mayor proposes a budget, I mean, a pay increase| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=13617)|
| 3:47:00| for all county employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=13620)|
| 3:47:01| Commissioner, we can't vote on our own budget if it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=13621)|
| 3:47:08| thank you charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=13628)|
| 3:47:09| Perhaps we've solved many problems with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=13629)|
| 3:47:12| Well, no, I mean, seriously, it looks to me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=13632)|
| 3:47:14| like we're creating problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=13634)|
| 3:47:16| Well, I didn't draft it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=13636)|
| 3:47:19| I understand, but what if the mayor proposes a budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=13639)|
| 3:47:22| increase for all county employees, say 1% or 2%,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=13642)|
| 3:47:26| whatever?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=13646)|
| 3:47:27| That affects everyone here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=13647)|
| 3:47:29| So that means we can't vote on the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=13649)|
| 3:47:31| I will not accept a pay raise so I can vote on the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=13651)|
| 3:47:34| Well, we did that last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=13654)|
| 3:47:37| And that doesn't necessarily mean that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=13657)|
| 3:47:39| I mean, well, hold on, hold on, let's go one at a time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=13659)|
| 3:47:43| You can't vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=13663)|
| 3:47:44| Let's go back to one at a time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=13664)|
| 3:47:46| Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=13666)|
| 3:47:48| Well, now, I would think even if there's not a pay increase,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=13668)|
| 3:47:57| if a person's pay comes from the Knox County budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=13677)|
| 3:48:01| that is the budget that will pay their salary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=13681)|
| 3:48:04| their spouse's salary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=13684)|
| 3:48:05| And as far as commissioners go, air commission salary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=13685)|
| 3:48:11| comes from Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=13691)|
| 3:48:12| I mean, I'm not challenging your opinion on this issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=13692)|
| 3:48:21| but let's just say, for instance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=13701)|
| 3:48:24| we take Craig out of the mix.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=13704)|
| 3:48:27| We take Mr. Pinkston out of the mix.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=13707)|
| 3:48:29| We take Brad out of the mix.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=13709)|
| 3:48:31| I don't know if anybody else here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=13711)|
| 3:48:32| has any family members that work for Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=13712)|
| 3:48:37| but an abstention counts as a no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=13717)|
| 3:48:40| You still have to have 10 positive votes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=13720)|
| 3:48:43| I could very easily see a situation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=13723)|
| 3:48:46| where this county could be thrown into complete gridlock| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=13726)|
| 3:48:52| because we have a budget that so few people are allowed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=13732)|
| 3:48:55| to vote on that it would take a unanimous vote of those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=13735)|
| 3:49:00| who were not conflicted to pass a budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=13740)|
| 3:49:03| That presents a real problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=13743)|
| 3:49:04| I get my cats fixed at the Young-Williams Animal Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=13744)|
| 3:49:09| Does that disqualify me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=13749)|
| 3:49:11| The cats may object.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=13751)|
| 3:49:12| You know, a tax increase affects all of us here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=13752)|
| 3:49:17| We can't vote for a tax increase if we need one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=13757)|
| 3:49:19| Amen to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=13759)|
| 3:49:22| All right, Commissioner Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=13762)|
| 3:49:25| You know, we can think of a lot of reasons| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=13765)|
| 3:49:26| why we can't do anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=13766)|
| 3:49:28| You know, one solution may be if it is to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=13768)|
| 3:49:31| is when we vote on the budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=13771)|
| 3:49:33| we can vote on the budget as a whole,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=13773)|
| 3:49:36| but pull out those departments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=13776)|
| 3:49:38| where there's a conflict of interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=13778)|
| 3:49:43| In other words, pull the health department out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=13783)|
| 3:49:45| and we vote on everything else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=13785)|
| 3:49:48| And then if there's a conflict there in the sheriff's office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=13788)|
| 3:49:51| we pull that out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=13791)|
| 3:49:52| And then everyone can vote on it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=13792)|
| 3:49:54| except for those that have the family member there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=13794)|
| 3:49:56| The only problem that I can foresee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=13796)|
| 3:49:58| Commissioner Briggs, is what if we have a very close vote| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=13798)|
| 3:50:03| where you're barely getting your 10 votes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=13803)|
| 3:50:07| and you can't complete the budget?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=13807)|
| 3:50:09| Let's say we needed Commissioner Anders| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=13809)|
| 3:50:13| to be able to vote in order to finish that part of it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=13813)|
| 3:50:18| to make it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=13818)|
| 3:50:19| I agree. I mean, I agree that's a problem,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=13819)|
| 3:50:21| but I'm trying to come up with the best solution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=13821)|
| 3:50:23| And I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=13823)|
| 3:50:24| I just, I'm foreseeing a possible flaw even within it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=13824)|
| 3:50:29| and I do appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=13829)|
| 3:50:30| You know, this also comes up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=13830)|
| 3:50:32| you start talking about a personal conflict of interest,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=13832)|
| 3:50:36| you know, we're talking about redistricting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=13836)|
| 3:50:39| You can't tell me that we all don't have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=13839)|
| 3:50:43| a possible personal interest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=13843)|
| 3:50:47| in the way these lines are drawn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=13847)|
| 3:50:50| So, Mr. Law Director, how do we get around that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=13850)|
| 3:50:57| I mean, I'm term-limited, and I don't feel like I have a,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=13857)|
| 3:51:01| you know, but there's only three of us that are term-limited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=13861)|
| 3:51:05| Let's slow down, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=13865)|
| 3:51:12| A suggestion, let's go back to the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=13872)|
| 3:51:16| In terms of, let's, we'll deal with your personal issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=13876)|
| 3:51:23| as commissioners in a moment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=13883)|
| 3:51:26| but let's deal with the one that has to do with spouses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=13886)|
| 3:51:30| Suggestion has been made that those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=13890)|
| 3:51:34| where there is a potential conflict of interest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=13894)|
| 3:51:37| in those areas, that they be discussed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=13897)|
| 3:51:42| and passed or not passed with those departments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=13902)|
| 3:51:47| which would allow individual commissioners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=13907)|
| 3:51:49| to recuse themselves| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=13909)|
| 3:51:53| if they do have a conflict of interest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=13913)|
| 3:51:56| based on personal interest, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=13916)|
| 3:51:59| So that takes care of that part| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=13919)|
| 3:52:01| of the potential conflict of interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=13921)|
| 3:52:05| In dealing with you individually,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=13925)|
| 3:52:08| we don't know what the budget is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=13928)|
| 3:52:09| we don't know if there's any increases, decreases, whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=13929)|
| 3:52:14| There's a doctrine in the law that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=13934)|
| 3:52:18| it is not to be interpreted if the result| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=13938)|
| 3:52:21| that would be accomplished is absurd,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=13941)|
| 3:52:26| if it has an absurd result.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=13946)|
| 3:52:30| And if the charter amendment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=13950)|
| 3:52:34| and I'll just tell you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=13954)|
| 3:52:36| it is drafted so broadly that there is no question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=13956)|
| 3:52:41| that it could, if it were literally imposed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=13961)|
| 3:52:45| and interpreted, cause you a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=13965)|
| 3:52:50| But if that result is absurd,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=13970)|
| 3:52:52| meaning that it would not allow you to pass a budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=13972)|
| 3:52:55| then the legal doctrine that I mentioned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=13975)|
| 3:52:57| would, I think, operate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=13977)|
| 3:53:00| and would allow you to do what it is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=13980)|
| 3:53:02| that you're charged by law to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=13982)|
| 3:53:04| and that's adopt and approve a budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=13984)|
| 3:53:11| Commissioner Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=13991)|
| 3:53:12| I'll just make one more comment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=13992)|
| 3:53:14| and I'm starting to talk this lawyer talk now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=13994)|
| 3:53:16| but when you talk about the intent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=13996)|
| 3:53:18| of the people that drew it up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=13998)|
| 3:53:20| and I don't think it was the intent of the charter amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=14000)|
| 3:53:25| when that was passed either by the commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=14005)|
| 3:53:28| or by the voters or by the petition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=14008)|
| 3:53:30| I guess it was all done by petition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=14010)|
| 3:53:33| to cause gridlock in county government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=14013)|
| 3:53:37| And I guess that goes along with what you're saying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=14017)|
| 3:53:40| on the absurdity question too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=14020)|
| 3:53:49| All right, next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=14029)|
| 3:53:52| The next item is discussion of Knott's County Schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=14032)|
| 3:53:55| fiscal year 09-10,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=14035)|
| 3:53:58| general purpose schools proposed budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=14038)|
| 3:54:00| by Dr. James P. McIntyre, Jr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=14040)|
| 3:54:02| He came to both committees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=14042)|
| 3:54:04| and he's not here, so we're moving on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=14044)|
| 3:54:08| Discussion regarding the transfer of...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=14048)|
| 3:54:09| That's already been taken care of with the vote we made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=14049)|
| 3:54:14| Yes, that was the resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=14054)|
| 3:54:16| Yeah, that was the resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=14056)|
| 3:54:18| 09-23.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=14058)|
| 3:54:19| 09-23, so that's been taken care of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=14059)|
| 3:54:21| Discussion regarding county government week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=14061)|
| 3:54:24| I'll make this really fast.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=14064)|
| 3:54:25| The first day of county government week is Sunday, May 3rd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=14065)|
| 3:54:29| Everyone is expected to be at Westtown Mall at 2 o'clock| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=14069)|
| 3:54:32| for a public interaction hour and a half or so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=14072)|
| 3:54:38| Where at Westtown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=14078)|
| 3:54:40| Where Santa Claus sets up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=14080)|
| 3:54:44| Ho, ho, ho.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=14084)|
| 3:54:47| On Tuesday, there will be 157th graders here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=14087)|
| 3:54:52| Each county department will have a booth set up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=14092)|
| 3:54:55| where they will be going around| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=14095)|
| 3:54:56| and getting their passport to county government stamped,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=14096)|
| 3:54:59| and we need commissioners to staff that booth during the day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=14099)|
| 3:55:06| How about the big softball challenge?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=14106)|
| 3:55:08| The softball thing is happening on Saturday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=14108)|
| 3:55:11| Doug Battelle is still in the process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=14111)|
| 3:55:13| of getting us a time and a place to play.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=14113)|
| 3:55:16| As soon as I have that, I'll send it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=14116)|
| 3:55:18| I know everybody's anxious to have that on their calendar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=14118)|
| 3:55:20| Everybody needs to email me what shirt size you wear| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=14120)|
| 3:55:24| and which position you want to play.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=14124)|
| 3:55:26| Otherwise, I will get you what I think will fit you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=14126)|
| 3:55:29| or I will put you where I think you're going to be best.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=14129)|
| 3:55:32| I only need one XL, not two, okay, just in case you were wondering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=14132)|
| 3:55:36| And I'm making really mean-looking T-shirts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=14136)|
| 3:55:38| because Michelle and I have decided that the only way we can win| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=14138)|
| 3:55:40| is by looking the best.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=14140)|
| 3:55:43| Well, we are the best.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=14143)|
| 3:55:44| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=14144)|
| 3:55:45| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=14145)|
| 3:55:47| Just a real quick show of hands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=14147)|
| 3:55:49| How many of us intend on playing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=14149)|
| 3:55:53| I've got to look at my calendar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=14153)|
| 3:55:54| One, two, three, four, five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=14154)|
| 3:55:57| Mine depends on the time because I'm going to not shift over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=14157)|
| 3:56:00| I make a motion that we add the law director to our team| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=14160)|
| 3:56:04| since he's on our team anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=14164)|
| 3:56:07| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=14167)|
| 3:56:08| He wishes to show up and wear our T-shirt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=14168)|
| 3:56:10| And his assistant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=14170)|
| 3:56:13| Ms. Chairman, I'd like nothing more than to come| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=14173)|
| 3:56:15| and show off my legs at this event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=14175)|
| 3:56:16| However, I'm going to be in Seattle, Washington then,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=14176)|
| 3:56:18| so I wish you all well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=14178)|
| 3:56:20| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=14180)|
| 3:56:21| Last item, except, well, that's been deferred.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=14181)|
| 3:56:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=14184)|
| 3:56:27| We've got in a little bit to the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=14187)|
| 3:56:30| I asked Jolie to come up with some times when this room is available| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=14190)|
| 3:56:35| if we wish to have some budget hearings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=14195)|
| 3:56:39| If we wish to discuss that right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=14199)|
| 3:56:45| I was thinking sometime mid-May would be about the earliest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=14205)|
| 3:56:52| They'd give us a couple of weeks after tomorrow to digest it a little bit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=14212)|
| 3:56:56| and maybe have some questions by then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=14216)|
| 3:57:00| Starting May the 11th, this room is available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=14220)|
| 3:57:05| That's a Monday, by the way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=14225)|
| 3:57:07| From 8 to 3, Tuesday the 12th, from 8 to 5,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=14227)|
| 3:57:13| Wednesday from 8 to 3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=14233)|
| 3:57:17| We're staying away from Fridays.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=14237)|
| 3:57:19| That Thursday is already booked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=14239)|
| 3:57:21| Come back the following week, we have committees Monday and Tuesday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=14241)|
| 3:57:29| And we could come in on Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=14249)|
| 3:57:35| After finance, we could have the remainder of the day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=14255)|
| 3:57:39| Tuesday, there are some intergovernmental.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=14259)|
| 3:57:45| It's at 8.30.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=14265)|
| 3:57:46| The city of Knoxville has.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=14266)|
| 3:57:49| So we could have it from intergovernmental| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=14269)|
| 3:57:51| until the city of Knoxville needs it at 5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=14271)|
| 3:57:53| So we could go until about 4.30.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=14273)|
| 3:57:55| But we have to leave here at 4.30.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=14275)|
| 3:57:57| Can we have any evening times in that first week?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=14277)|
| 3:58:01| Is that possible?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=14281)|
| 3:58:02| Yeah, I mean, I agree with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=14282)|
| 3:58:04| I think we need to have a blend, some days and then some evenings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=14284)|
| 3:58:07| Well, this is what she's, I'm just going by what the hour she gave me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=14287)|
| 3:58:12| How many days do you have?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=14292)|
| 3:58:13| Do we know if any of these evenings are open?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=14293)|
| 3:58:21| It appears.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=14301)|
| 3:58:23| She'll have anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=14303)|
| 3:58:25| They start at 3.30.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=14305)|
| 3:58:27| Who knows when they'll be open?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=14307)|
| 3:58:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=14311)|
| 3:58:34| On the 11th, you've got TTCDA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=14314)|
| 3:58:37| They meet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=14317)|
| 3:58:38| You've got 3.30, but I thought they met at 4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=14318)|
| 3:58:41| They go in at 3.30.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=14321)|
| 3:58:42| But they go in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=14322)|
| 3:58:43| They'll need it from 3.30 on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=14323)|
| 3:58:44| That's why we have to stop by 3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=14324)|
| 3:58:47| I would say the 12th, there's nothing down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=14327)|
| 3:58:49| We could have that probably the entire day, if we so wish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=14329)|
| 3:58:53| Correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=14333)|
| 3:58:55| There is a conflict at 3.45 on Wednesday the 13th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=14335)|
| 3:59:01| You've got Thursday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=14341)|
| 3:59:02| You've got NPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=14342)|
| 3:59:03| That pretty well takes out that whole day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=14343)|
| 3:59:06| Monday the 18th, you've got finance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=14346)|
| 3:59:10| And then we have the remainder of the day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=14350)|
| 3:59:15| The 19th, you've got intergovernmental at 8.30.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=14355)|
| 3:59:19| And then we could have it until 4.30, because that's when City of Knoxville needs it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=14359)|
| 3:59:27| Wednesday the 20th is out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=14367)|
| 3:59:30| And then Thursday the 21st, 8 until 3, because the City of Knoxville needs it at 3.30.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=14370)|
| 3:59:39| It looks like if you really just want to have it open-ended, use it for whatever times we wish to have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=14379)|
| 3:59:47| Start in the morning, go as late as we wish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=14387)|
| 3:59:49| May the 12th, which is a Tuesday, appears to be the best.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=14389)|
| 3:59:57| Any ideas?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=14397)|
| 4:00:00| I'm open May the 12th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=14400)|
| 4:00:02| Do we want to go ahead and take a motion so we can set this up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=14402)|
| 4:00:06| Mr. Law Director, would that be proper?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=14406)|
| 4:00:11| Schedule a budget hearing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=14411)|
| 4:00:12| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=14412)|
| 4:00:13| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=14413)|
| 4:00:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=14414)|
| 4:00:15| Do I hear a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=14415)|
| 4:00:16| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=14416)|
| 4:00:17| And the motion is to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=14417)|
| 4:00:19| May 12th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=14419)|
| 4:00:20| May 12th, starting at what time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=14420)|
| 4:00:22| At what time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=14422)|
| 4:00:23| 8.30.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=14423)|
| 4:00:26| And we will go until we're done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=14426)|
| 4:00:30| Commissioner Luthor, we are going to have department heads come down, aren't we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=14430)|
| 4:00:34| Well, now that was the second part of what I was going to get to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=14434)|
| 4:00:39| Do we want to have department heads that day?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=14439)|
| 4:00:43| And do we want to have a separate day for community grants?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=14443)|
| 4:00:47| Craig, I'm sorry to interrupt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=14447)|
| 4:00:49| But on May 12th, those of you who have checked your mailbox may notice I gave you a book| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=14449)|
| 4:00:55| and a ticket to a luncheon, and the luncheon is that day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=14455)|
| 4:00:59| So I would ask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=14459)|
| 4:01:00| Well, we could break for lunch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=14460)|
| 4:01:01| I would ask that we break and go to that luncheon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=14461)|
| 4:01:04| I think it's going to be very entertaining.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=14464)|
| 4:01:06| Where's the luncheon at?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=14466)|
| 4:01:07| It's at the convention center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=14467)|
| 4:01:09| Just across the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=14469)|
| 4:01:11| It's walking distance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=14471)|
| 4:01:12| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=14472)|
| 4:01:13| So if we were to start at 8.30, break by?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=14473)|
| 4:01:16| 11.30.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=14476)|
| 4:01:17| 11.30, we could come back by?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=14477)|
| 4:01:20| 1.30.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=14480)|
| 4:01:21| 1.30.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=14481)|
| 4:01:22| So we could break it into those two segments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=14482)|
| 4:01:25| We will be needing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=14485)|
| 4:01:26| We could do department heads in the morning as far as we can schedule them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=14486)|
| 4:01:32| And then whether or not we want to get into community grants or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=14492)|
| 4:01:37| I don't think we need to get into those the same day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=14497)|
| 4:01:39| That's too much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=14499)|
| 4:01:41| For right now, what we'll do is do Tuesday, May the 12th, starting at 8.30.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=14501)|
| 4:01:53| We'll break at 11.30 for lunch, come back at 1.30 and finish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=14513)|
| 4:01:57| And that will be for department heads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=14517)|
| 4:02:00| Can you give us a list, like, who's coming at 9?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=14520)|
| 4:02:05| What we'll do is we'll have the commission office schedule that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=14525)|
| 4:02:10| I think if we could start out with schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=14530)|
| 4:02:14| and then maybe the sheriff, the bigger, give them more time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=14534)|
| 4:02:18| and then come back with some of the others with smaller blocks of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=14538)|
| 4:02:24| And what I'll do is I'll get with Joe Lee and see if we can get a schedule put together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=14544)|
| 4:02:29| We will get that out ahead of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=14549)|
| 4:02:32| You know, depending on this budget, the department heads may not need to talk very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=14552)|
| 4:02:36| They may come in and say, I agree with the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=14556)|
| 4:02:40| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=14560)|
| 4:02:41| It might be that quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=14561)|
| 4:02:42| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=14562)|
| 4:02:43| Mr. Chairman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=14563)|
| 4:02:45| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=14565)|
| 4:02:46| Can we have, and I don't know how everybody else feels about this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=14566)|
| 4:02:49| but I'd like to have an evening sometime where the public can come and express their views.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=14569)|
| 4:02:57| I would imagine that something will be on our regular meeting possibly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=14577)|
| 4:03:06| I mean, I'm all for having this all-day meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=14586)|
| 4:03:09| I just want to make sure that we have an opportunity for the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=14589)|
| 4:03:14| I guess they can come during the debate of one of our commission meetings when we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=14594)|
| 4:03:17| I'm sure we'll have it on our regular agenda| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=14597)|
| 4:03:20| so that we will probably have some discussion at finance and intergovernmental.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=14600)|
| 4:03:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=14606)|
| 4:03:27| I know that's morning time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=14607)|
| 4:03:28| And then on the, let's see, May, it will actually have to be Tuesday the 19th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=14608)|
| 4:03:41| Yeah, it will have to be Tuesday the 26th because we have Memorial Day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=14621)|
| 4:03:47| So that can be the evening time where the public can come and express.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=14627)|
| 4:03:52| They could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=14632)|
| 4:03:55| We could set that up in the first week of June.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=14635)|
| 4:03:58| We could set it sometime up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=14638)|
| 4:03:59| We could discuss that later on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=14639)|
| 4:04:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=14641)|
| 4:04:02| I just want to make sure it gets covered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=14642)|
| 4:04:05| That's a good idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=14645)|
| 4:04:06| But, you know, maybe once we see what the budget is and we get into it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=14646)|
| 4:04:12| it might be more clear than what it is right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=14652)|
| 4:04:15| But what we'll do is go ahead and set this up for the 12th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=14655)|
| 4:04:21| And so is that the motion on the floor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=14661)|
| 4:04:25| Mr. Chairman, I would like to see us have another day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=14665)|
| 4:04:28| Since I've been on commission, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=14668)|
| 4:04:30| we have come in and we have given department heads five minutes, ten minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=14670)|
| 4:04:34| I don't think that's enough time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=14674)|
| 4:04:36| I mean, if we're going to just rubber stamp the budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=14676)|
| 4:04:38| and just say, all right, whatever the mayor is proposing we're good with, let's go home,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=14678)|
| 4:04:42| I don't think that's what our citizens want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=14682)|
| 4:04:44| I think they want us to really look at this budget and ask questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=14684)|
| 4:04:47| And with the schools, if we're just going to give them 30 minutes, as we have in the past,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=14687)|
| 4:04:51| I don't think that's enough time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=14691)|
| 4:04:53| I mean, I really think our citizens want us to scrutinize this and ask questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=14693)|
| 4:04:56| So I would just ask that I'm not going to be here the 12th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=14696)|
| 4:04:59| but I'm just saying that I think that we need to spend a little bit more time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=14699)|
| 4:05:02| than just five or ten minutes with these departments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=14702)|
| 4:05:04| Well, and I agree, I'm just trying to get a start on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=14704)|
| 4:05:08| And I think this is a good start.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=14708)|
| 4:05:10| And then once we see what's going on with the budget on the 12th, maybe at that time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=14710)|
| 4:05:17| if we can make that part of our, since it's a special called meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=14717)|
| 4:05:21| make that part of the agenda to set another time if need be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=14721)|
| 4:05:28| If that can be on the agenda, then that leaves it to where at that time we can schedule more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=14728)|
| 4:05:34| Well, you said the 13th was open there, too, Craig.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=14734)|
| 4:05:37| The 13th is open from 8 to 3, but that's not an evening time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=14737)|
| 4:05:41| It's from the evening time on is taken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=14741)|
| 4:05:44| But as for using it as a second day to get all these department heads in, it might be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=14744)|
| 4:05:52| Did we use the small assembly room?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=14752)|
| 4:05:56| Well, we typically have not used the small assembly room for something as important as a budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=14756)|
| 4:06:01| They're better recording, they put it on TV.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=14761)|
| 4:06:04| Not that they can't put that on TV, but it's just easier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=14764)|
| 4:06:10| You need a motion, Chairman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=14770)|
| 4:06:13| We have a motion, and I'm just clarifying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=14773)|
| 4:06:16| Does the maker of the motion agree to the 12th and under those terms?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=14776)|
| 4:06:20| And does the second agree to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=14780)|
| 4:06:22| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=14782)|
| 4:06:23| Commissioner Anders?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=14783)|
| 4:06:24| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=14784)|
| 4:06:25| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=14785)|
| 4:06:26| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=14786)|
| 4:06:27| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=14787)|
| 4:06:28| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=14788)|
| 4:06:29| Ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=14789)|
| 4:06:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=14790)|
| 4:06:31| It's a good thing, obviously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=14791)|
| 4:06:33| Craig, you did a good job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part2?start=14793)|
