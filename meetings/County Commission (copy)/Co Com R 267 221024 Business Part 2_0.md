| 0:08:40| This year we're going to pay about $6,400 in property tax for our leasehold improvements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=520)|
| 0:08:45| We're going to pay probably $8,500 in sales tax that we pay, and that will increase over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=525)|
| 0:08:53| the years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=533)|
| 0:08:55| We have leasehold improvements on lease community land that have been paid for by CYC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=535)|
| 0:09:01| So when we got the land, it was a piece of land that had a ramp for seaplanes because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=541)|
| 0:09:07| it was a seaplane train thing with a Quonset hut, nothing else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=547)|
| 0:09:11| Since then, we've probably put several million dollars in putting blacktop roads in it, railway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=551)|
| 0:09:16| hoists to bring boats up, clubhouse, pavilions, you name it, we put it in to support the programs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=556)|
| 0:09:24| we have, which are basically not only for our members, but for the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=564)|
| 0:09:30| And before I left home, I said, let me just do some rough numbers here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=570)|
| 0:09:36| We have a sail camp program every June.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=576)|
| 0:09:38| Four weeks in June, kids 8 to 18 come and go to sail camp.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=578)|
| 0:09:44| Not that expensive, but somebody mentions it's cheaper than sending them to other kind| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=584)|
| 0:09:47| of camps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=587)|
| 0:09:48| But they come there, spend a day for a week, and they learn different skills in sailing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=588)|
| 0:09:53| They have games, they do stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=593)|
| 0:09:55| It's a wonderful experience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=595)|
| 0:09:56| And we have certified instructors that are from the US sailing things, which are our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=596)|
| 0:09:59| members, have trained these people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=599)|
| 0:10:03| So that's about 180 to 200 students in sail camp every year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=603)|
| 0:10:07| Then you take the adult learn to sail program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=607)|
| 0:10:10| People say, well, yeah, I pass by it all the time, I see the signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=610)|
| 0:10:14| But on an annual basis, we offer about now four adult learn to sail programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=614)|
| 0:10:19| That means that somebody says, I'd like to learn how to sail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=619)|
| 0:10:22| And we have facilities, either on a keelboat or a dinghy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=622)|
| 0:10:26| And it's not that expensive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=626)|
| 0:10:27| They come and they do some classroom training on the water training, and then they get a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=627)|
| 0:10:31| test and get certified under US sailing as a type one certified sailor for that type| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=631)|
| 0:10:36| of boat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=636)|
| 0:10:38| We had probably, and we can only hold about 12 people in a class.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=638)|
| 0:10:41| So we probably do, in a non-COVID period of time, the adult learn to sail program is probably| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=641)|
| 0:10:47| about 40 students a year, 40 to 50 students a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=647)|
| 0:10:52| UT sailing, UT has a sailing club.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=652)|
| 0:10:54| And most colleges that are in this region, most colleges all the way, have sailing clubs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=654)|
| 0:11:00| And they compete, intercollegiate, just like they do with tennis and golf and other things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=660)|
| 0:11:04| Well, UT uses our facilities to come and train, and we hold intercollegiate regattas at our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=664)|
| 0:11:11| yacht club.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=671)|
| 0:11:12| Again, they pay dues to be in the sailing club, but anyway, it's another outreach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=672)|
| 0:11:18| Ship 300, we are the chartering organization for, it's a sea scout, which is similar to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=678)|
| 0:11:24| a boy scout organization, and we charter them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=684)|
| 0:11:27| So we're the executive organization for Ship 300.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=687)|
| 0:11:31| And they range depending on 10 to 20 members that, they're out sailing just about every| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=691)|
| 0:11:37| Sunday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=697)|
| 0:11:38| They do events at the club.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=698)|
| 0:11:40| They have training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=700)|
| 0:11:41| So it's a wonderful program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=701)|
| 0:11:44| Then we have, we said, well, we need to reach out to do other training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=704)|
| 0:11:47| So we go to a company called True Course Captain School, and they're out of Florida.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=707)|
| 0:11:53| We provide the facilities for them to come and teach as many as 25 people for over a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=713)|
| 0:11:58| couple of weeks period of time, so they get certified in different skills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=718)|
| 0:12:02| The big one that they like is called a six pack, which means that you can be certified| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=722)|
| 0:12:06| as a skipper of a boat and have six people on board, max six people, and if they're paying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=726)|
| 0:12:12| for the service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=732)|
| 0:12:13| Then there are other things like navigation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=733)|
| 0:12:15| I've talked to the people in this class.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=735)|
| 0:12:18| Most of them don't sail, but their career on the marine part of the river and events,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=738)|
| 0:12:24| they need to have certification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=744)|
| 0:12:25| So they come and get this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=745)|
| 0:12:26| They may have to travel four or five states to get to it, but we provide that service| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=746)|
| 0:12:30| here at no cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=750)|
| 0:12:31| Now, the school that comes here and does it has a fee, but we let them use our facilities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=751)|
| 0:12:36| for free.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=756)|
| 0:12:37| There are multiple examples of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=757)|
| 0:12:39| So I just did the numbers and said, what does that look like?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=759)|
| 0:12:42| That looks like 320 to say 375 people a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=762)|
| 0:12:46| If you did that for 10 years, that's about 3,200 to 3,750 people in the Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=766)|
| 0:12:53| mostly Knox County, and most of those, 90% of them are not members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=773)|
| 0:13:00| Again, that's the kick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=780)|
| 0:13:02| You don't have to be a club member to participate in these programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=782)|
| 0:13:07| So we offer that service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=787)|
| 0:13:09| It's not offered by anyone else in the community, and that's the value that we provide back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=789)|
| 0:13:16| to Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=796)|
| 0:13:17| Yeah, we pay sales tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=797)|
| 0:13:18| Yeah, we pay property tax, you know, but that's not the real thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=798)|
| 0:13:23| The thing is we're providing the mission statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=803)|
| 0:13:26| Mission statement says recreational activities for the park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=806)|
| 0:13:30| That's what we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=810)|
| 0:13:31| The park is not interested, as I understand, with providing these services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=811)|
| 0:13:34| They don't have the people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=814)|
| 0:13:35| They don't have the certified teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=815)|
| 0:13:36| They don't have the things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=816)|
| 0:13:38| And we've done all this without taking one cent from the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=818)|
| 0:13:44| Everything you see at our club, and some people have come to visit our club, is substantial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=824)|
| 0:13:48| that we've put in there over years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=828)|
| 0:13:49| We have a totally volunteer club, which means that our members do 20 work hours a year to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=829)|
| 0:13:55| help do the maintenance and do things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=835)|
| 0:13:56| But like this year, we're going to spend $119,000 on deferred maintenance things for docks and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=836)|
| 0:14:02| different things that need to be worked on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=842)|
| 0:14:05| So again, we're a nonprofit, a 501c3 for the sailing part of it, for the sailing CSC, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=845)|
| 0:14:13| a 501c7 for the club.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=853)|
| 0:14:16| One's recreation, one's education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=856)|
| 0:14:19| So we're not a commercial operation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=859)|
| 0:14:22| And it's not for the benefit of the CYC members, because they can sail their boats and take| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=862)|
| 0:14:27| their boats to Blue Springs or someplace else, or someplace else to find a place to put their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=867)|
| 0:14:31| boats.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=871)|
| 0:14:32| This is something that benefits the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=872)|
| 0:14:35| I think we have a strong outreach program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=875)|
| 0:14:38| It's impactful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=878)|
| 0:14:39| And it's a service that we provide to the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=879)|
| 0:14:42| So when I hear people say, well, it's a yacht club, you know, and basically, you know, it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=882)|
| 0:14:46| for the members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=886)|
| 0:14:47| You're not doing this for the members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=887)|
| 0:14:49| You're doing this for the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=889)|
| 0:14:50| And why we would like to have a 10-year lease with a 10-year option?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=890)|
| 0:14:55| Because since 63, we've always had that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=895)|
| 0:14:58| It gives us a level of confidence and surety in our staying at the park so we can make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=898)|
| 0:15:04| the decisions to spend the money for deferred maintenance, for the docks, for the leasehold| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=904)|
| 0:15:09| improvements, for the boats, for the programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=909)|
| 0:15:12| All of that's paid for by what you would call membership dues and stuff, some fees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=912)|
| 0:15:17| So, you know, again, we would ask the commission to consider this as, you know, we've been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=917)|
| 0:15:23| there seven years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=923)|
| 0:15:24| So we don't want to see ourselves as a five-year term, and then after the five-year term, we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=924)|
| 0:15:29| don't know what's going to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=929)|
| 0:15:30| It makes it very difficult for us to sit down and program the expenses that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=930)|
| 0:15:36| And as you get closer to the five years, people are saying, well, they're going to cancel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=936)|
| 0:15:39| our lease.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=939)|
| 0:15:40| So, again, we come here in good faith and hope that you understand what we do and how| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=940)|
| 0:15:46| we do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=946)|
| 0:15:47| And some of you have the booklets, I think, the digitized forms that I've sent around| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=947)|
| 0:15:51| that has a lot of information about what we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=951)|
| 0:15:56| And all we're asking to do is to be a part of the community and serve it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=956)|
| 0:15:59| We go away, then all of those outreach programs go away, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=959)|
| 0:16:04| So, Mike, I conclude.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=964)|
| 0:16:05| Dana, you want to say something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=965)|
| 0:16:07| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=967)|
| 0:16:08| You've covered it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=968)|
| 0:16:09| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=969)|
| 0:16:10| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=970)|
| 0:16:11| So that's kind of our way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=971)|
| 0:16:13| That's where we are with the $5,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=973)|
| 0:16:18| Talking to Joe Mack, the parks director, has an organization, two organizations, but one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=978)|
| 0:16:22| particular, it's a group that trains and does training inside the park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=982)|
| 0:16:29| And they lock up all their stuff so nobody can get to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=989)|
| 0:16:31| And there's a fee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=991)|
| 0:16:32| They pay the park $5,000 a year to do just what we do, to train people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=992)|
| 0:16:39| So there's your comparable right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=999)|
| 0:16:42| It's already being administered by the park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=1002)|
| 0:16:44| He said that's $5,000 is their annual fee for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=1004)|
| 0:16:47| So, again, we're willing to work with you on the rental part of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=1007)|
| 0:16:51| But the term of the lease seems to be, it's onerous in terms of our park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=1011)|
| 0:16:57| You all make the decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=1017)|
| 0:16:58| We're thankful for being there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=1018)|
| 0:17:00| But a 10-10 is not that big of a deal if you consider us a neighbor in the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=1020)|
| 0:17:08| that serves it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=1028)|
| 0:17:10| And that's my case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=1030)|
| 0:17:11| So with that, I turn it over to you guys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=1031)|
| 0:17:15| We're happy to answer any questions that you have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=1035)|

| 0:17:32| And first, just so you both understand, this body has a fiduciary responsibility to protect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=1052)|
| 0:17:38| the citizens and taxpayers of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=1058)|

| 0:17:55| Currently, you have 230 members, member families, I should say, memberships, OK, that's basically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=1075)|

| 0:18:12| It's a closed facility to the general public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=1092)|
| 0:18:14| No, it's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=1094)|
| 0:18:15| In other words, you cannot just drive down there tomorrow at 10 o'clock in the morning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=1095)|
| 0:18:18| and use that facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=1098)|
| 0:18:20| It's locked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=1100)|
| 0:18:21| Let me pose the answer to your question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=1101)|
| 0:18:24| We have a gate that's coded, and that's because we have millions of dollars worth of boats| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=1104)|
| 0:18:29| on the land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=1109)|
| 0:18:30| Sir, please use your, will you please use the microphone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=1110)|
| 0:18:32| We have a coded gate that our members have an access card to, and when the gate was broken| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=1112)|
| 0:18:38| by an electrical storm, oh, about a couple of years ago, I had it replaced, and it was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=1118)|
| 0:18:42| over six months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=1122)|
| 0:18:43| We had motorboats taken, we had, not motorboats, engines taken, parts taken, some boats taken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=1123)|
| 0:18:50| We had, so it's no different, it's no different than the Concord Marina, which is right across| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=1130)|
| 0:18:57| the street in LLC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=1137)|
| 0:18:59| You can't walk onto their docks and get onto the people's boats that they pay to keep there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=1139)|
| 0:19:05| So we're in the same category.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=1145)|
| 0:19:09| But if they want to be a member, they can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=1149)|
| 0:19:11| The property that you have, in my estimation, is one of the top five Knox County assets| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=1151)|
| 0:19:17| that we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=1157)|
| 0:19:18| My goodness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=1158)|
| 0:19:19| And it's not open to the general public on a daily basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=1159)|
| 0:19:23| And your current rent, and it has been set for 25 consecutive years, is $1,000 to rent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=1163)|
| 0:19:30| that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=1170)|
| 0:19:31| And I'm glad you brought up some of the information that you mentioned in your packet here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=1171)|
| 0:19:37| In June, you have four weeks of sail camp for 180 to 200 campers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=1177)|

| 0:20:16| Yeah, it's not a camp.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=1216)|
| 0:20:17| It's just a...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=1217)|
| 0:20:18| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=1218)|
| 0:20:19| And it costs them $500 each to go to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=1219)|
| 0:20:23| There's nothing that's provided to a Knox County citizen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=1223)|
| 0:20:29| You also said that the Sea Scouts use that facility, but each of the Sea Scouts families| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=1229)|
| 0:20:35| have to pay $100 a year for a boat usage fee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=1235)|
| 0:20:39| They don't pay us anything for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=1239)|
| 0:20:43| That's their fees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=1243)|
| 0:20:44| Think of it as a Boy Scout troop or a Girl Scout troop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=1244)|
| 0:20:46| They have fees that belong to the troop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=1246)|
| 0:20:48| They don't pay us anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=1248)|
| 0:20:49| As a matter of fact, we own all of the boats that...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=1249)|
| 0:20:52| Okay, it says a user fee that goes to the club, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=1252)|
| 0:20:56| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=1256)|
| 0:20:57| The $100 doesn't go to the club for a boat user fee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=1257)|

| 0:21:02| And besides that, while you're on the Sea Scouts, we own all of the boats because the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=1262)|

| 0:21:13| We insure them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=1273)|

| 0:22:29| I see your point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=1349)|
| 0:22:32| Let's go back to the UT Sailing Club.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=1352)|
| 0:22:35| It says in your document here that you contribute $2,500 to the UT Sailing Club, but yet you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=1355)|
| 0:22:44| only want to spend $1,000 with Knox County for all that wonderful property right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=1364)|
| 0:22:51| And then you keep going on about this non-profit and all that, but yet according to the documents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=1371)|
| 0:22:57| you just sent us, you've got over $420,000 in the bank.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=1377)|
| 0:23:01| And we're going to spend over $120,000 just to...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=1381)|
| 0:23:04| And do you know that just down the road at Jefferson Park, do you know where that is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=1384)|
| 0:23:09| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=1389)|
| 0:23:10| Do you know where Montgomery Cove is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=1390)|
| 0:23:11| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=1391)|

| 0:23:16| Do you know where Choteau Road is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=1396)|
| 0:23:17| Jefferson Park Subdivision, do you know where that is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=1397)|
| 0:23:18| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=1398)|
| 0:23:19| Jefferson Park, for a single boat slip, if you want to buy it, it's $100,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=1399)|
| 0:23:26| At Bayou Bend, almost diagonally across the street, a single boat slip sells between $30,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=1406)|
| 0:23:32| and $50,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=1412)|
| 0:23:34| We've got one of the nicest pieces of property in Knox County that's being used by 230 members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=1414)|
| 0:23:44| where they're paying $70 a month to moor their boat, or a slip fee, where if that individual| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=1424)|
| 0:23:51| had to go down the road to 10-mile, they'd be paying in the $225 range.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=1431)|
| 0:23:56| Yeah, maybe $300.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=1436)|
| 0:23:57| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=1437)|
| 0:23:58| You're correct about that, but you're not counting for volunteers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=1438)|
| 0:23:59| So you guys are getting a sweetheart deal on this property for $1,000 a year, but I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=1439)|
| 0:24:04| don't think you guys realize how, for the past 25 years, what you guys have had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=1444)|
| 0:24:11| And now you want to continue that on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=1451)|
| 0:24:14| It makes absolutely no sense to me that one of the premier pieces of property on North| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=1454)|
| 0:24:20| Shore Drive is being rented for $1,000 a year to 230 members for exclusive use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=1460)|
| 0:24:28| And basically, nobody in Knox County can use that unless you join a membership or you pay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=1468)|
| 0:24:34| $500 to go to adult camp.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=1474)|
| 0:24:36| Well, is $5,000 acceptable?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=1476)|
| 0:24:37| I mean, we've had this conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=1477)|
| 0:24:41| Not at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=1481)|
| 0:24:42| There is no amount that you would consider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=1482)|
| 0:24:46| If you want to base it on a commercial marina, go to LLC next door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=1486)|
| 0:24:51| What this body may want to consider is, because this is prime real estate and it's supposed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=1491)|
| 0:24:56| to be used for recreation for the citizens of Knox County, we may want to look at an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=1496)|
| 0:25:01| RFP to how to use this property to best serve all of Knox County instead of having it as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=1501)|
| 0:25:07| a private club for 230 members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=1507)|
| 0:25:11| And I'll yield.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=1511)|
| 0:25:12| Thank you, Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=1512)|
| 0:25:15| Commissioner Frazier, I saw your light on next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=1515)|
| 0:25:17| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=1517)|
| 0:25:18| I just want to thank you all for showing me around the other day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=1518)|
| 0:25:22| I really enjoyed seeing the property and talking with you all and learning more about the programs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=1522)|
| 0:25:26| and the services that you do provide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=1526)|
| 0:25:29| And personally, I do see great value in what you do and I just wanted to say that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=1529)|
| 0:25:34| I do also see the perspective of Commissioner Schoonmaker and what I really wanted to say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=1534)|
| 0:25:39| to you is I don't want you to feel like we're singling you out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=1539)|
| 0:25:44| This is a review of several different agreements that we have that are similar to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=1544)|
| 0:25:49| Yours just kind of came up and it has been 25 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=1549)|
| 0:25:54| And so we in no way want to cause any hardship upon you or any of the services that you provide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=1554)|
| 0:26:00| because we do value you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=1560)|
| 0:26:03| I appreciate the community partnership with you and the services you provide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=1563)|
| 0:26:09| I do see a value.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=1569)|
| 0:26:11| Please use the microphone, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=1571)|
| 0:26:16| It sounds like the Commissioner would like to see what else they could do with that to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=1576)|
| 0:26:21| provide more service to the community and or to raise more funds in a recreational format.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=1581)|
| 0:26:28| And I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=1588)|
| 0:26:30| So if that's the direction that the Commission is going in, then basically our home is gone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=1590)|
| 0:26:35| It's not going to be there and we're not going to provide any of the programs, not that anybody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=1595)|
| 0:26:39| else couldn't, but that's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=1599)|
| 0:26:41| I have just a few more, maybe a question or comment, maybe that Director Mack or Mr. Vanderbeek| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=1601)|
| 0:26:48| could answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=1608)|
| 0:26:50| Just speaking to their concerns about the five and five, and when I was out there they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=1610)|
| 0:26:54| talked about a lot of the capital improvements that they have made that have become fixed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=1614)|
| 0:27:00| assets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=1620)|
| 0:27:01| And I know that kind of puts us in a tricky situation or an agreement owning the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=1621)|
| 0:27:05| and the fixed assets then belonging to the club.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=1625)|
| 0:27:09| And one thing they mentioned was a lot of times when their board makes decisions for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=1629)|
| 0:27:12| capital improvements, those are pretty substantial based on their budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=1632)|
| 0:27:18| And sometimes it may take three, four years because they're all volunteer-based.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=1638)|
| 0:27:23| And they had a concern about what if our lease comes up in the middle of a project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=1643)|
| 0:27:27| And one question I had is, it's my understanding having worked on other non-profit boards that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=1647)|
| 0:27:33| if there is a lease agreement like that and we do have a capital project coming up that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=1653)|
| 0:27:38| we can actually go to the county and say I'd like to renew early, is that a possibility?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=1658)|
| 0:27:46| It certainly is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=1666)|
| 0:27:48| And I would know this commission wants to be respectful both of the balance between| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=1668)|
| 0:27:52| the public interest and managing or allowing the non-profit partner to manage their risk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=1672)|
| 0:28:00| I should say too, I appreciate Commissioner Lee's substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=1680)|
| 0:28:06| We are very comfortable both with those terms financially.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=1686)|
| 0:28:09| We think that reflects some of the relationships we have with some of our other non-profit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=1689)|
| 0:28:13| partners, youth soccer organizations, youth sports organizations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=1693)|
| 0:28:18| And one of the points we would make about those is they provide a service so in effect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=1698)|
| 0:28:23| we don't have to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=1703)|
| 0:28:24| So Director Mack does not have a youth soccer program of Knox County employees that are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=1704)|
| 0:28:29| going out and providing the service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=1709)|
| 0:28:31| Our non-profit partners do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=1711)|
| 0:28:34| We do charge them $5,000 a year for the use of our facilities and it strikes me as a reasonable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=1714)|
| 0:28:39| figure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=1719)|
| 0:28:40| So to your question, Commissioner Frazier, they could certainly come back if they were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=1720)|
| 0:28:45| looking at a large scale capital investment and ask to open the lease back up and renegotiate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=1725)|
| 0:28:51| it at that time and ask for an extension based on the investment that they propose to make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=1731)|
| 0:28:56| Again that's a matter of balancing risk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=1736)|
| 0:28:59| They have to take some of those risks and of course the county takes some of those risks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=1739)|
| 0:29:04| So we certainly wouldn't be averse to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=1744)|
| 0:29:07| I think the five and five works and this board could come back, the CYC board could come| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=1747)|
| 0:29:13| back to us if it was an impediment to larger capital investments and approach commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=1753)|
| 0:29:19| this is a reasonable body, approach commission at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=1759)|
| 0:29:22| So I don't know if that is direct to your question but I hope it helps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=1762)|
| 0:29:25| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=1765)|
| 0:29:26| I have a follow-up question or actually it was just an observation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=1766)|
| 0:29:28| I found it odd that the University of Tennessee really doesn't provide any sort of financial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=1768)|
| 0:29:34| gift to the Yacht Club.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=1774)|
| 0:29:36| Let me answer your question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=1776)|
| 0:29:38| We're working on a new agreement with UT and in the contract it says notwithstanding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=1778)|
| 0:29:48| UT's payment to CYC for all of the assets, the maintenance of the boats and all that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=1788)|
| 0:29:54| kind of stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=1794)|
| 0:29:55| So part of the new agreement, which is going to supersede or make the old agreement that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=1795)|
| 0:30:01| is really, really old go away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=1801)|
| 0:30:03| So instead of us giving them $2,600, $2,500, they are going to be providing us with funds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=1803)|
| 0:30:08| because we provide docks, we provide boats.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=1808)|
| 0:30:11| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=1811)|
| 0:30:12| That's what I was kind of getting at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=1812)|
| 0:30:13| So we are moving in that direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=1813)|
| 0:30:14| And I encourage you to get with Director Mack because I think the county had a great community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=1814)|
| 0:30:19| partnership with Beverly Park and we were able to accomplish some mutual goals and maybe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=1819)|
| 0:30:25| you could kind of help guide them on that process and how to optimize that relationship.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=1825)|
| 0:30:31| If you would just kind of reach out to them and do that, I think they would very much| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=1831)|
| 0:30:34| appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=1834)|
| 0:30:35| Thank you very much for your comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=1835)|
| 0:30:40| Commissioner Hill, I saw your light on next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=1840)|
| 0:30:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=1844)|
| 0:30:47| My history with your club and the reason I didn't go out to tour your club was because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=1847)|
| 0:30:52| I've actually had my kids and my grandkids out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=1852)|
| 0:30:57| I live in the Carnes, Hardin Valley area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=1857)|
| 0:31:00| I think one of the issues is that I know some other commissioners, again, the CYC thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=1860)|
| 0:31:10| sounds very, you know, exclusive, however, because of where you are located, which is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=1870)|
| 0:31:20| nothing you can do anything about, but, you know, you're pretty deep west and not convenient| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=1880)|
| 0:31:26| to a big part of the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=1886)|
| 0:31:28| So I can absolutely understand why other parts of the county may not have even heard anything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=1888)|
| 0:31:34| about you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=1894)|
| 0:31:35| I'm not real sure what to do about that, you know, if you need advertising or, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=1895)|
| 0:31:41| I don't know what the answer is to that, but the fact of the matter is that you have always| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=1901)|
| 0:31:48| been there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=1908)|
| 0:31:49| You have always been a part of the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=1909)|
| 0:31:51| I've not known a lot about some of the outreach that you've done with certain groups, but...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=1911)|
| 0:31:58| We do a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=1918)|
| 0:31:59| I'm sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=1919)|
| 0:32:00| Yeah, oh, and I saw, I read what you brought, but I mean, prior to this...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=1920)|
| 0:32:03| Hardin Valley School, high school, is, before COVID, we had four high schools that participated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=1923)|
| 0:32:10| in that and it was extracurricular activity from the students and they come out and train| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=1930)|
| 0:32:15| there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=1935)|
| 0:32:16| They sailed in teams and stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=1936)|
| 0:32:17| So we have a volunteer, Andrea Fry, Andrea Terry, and she is starting to get to resurrect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=1937)|
| 0:32:25| that program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=1945)|
| 0:32:26| Hardin Valley is the first one, if you've seen the pictures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=1946)|
| 0:32:29| Well, listen, I'm on your side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=1949)|
| 0:32:30| Yeah, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=1950)|
| 0:32:31| I'm on your side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=1951)|
| 0:32:32| So we're reaching out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=1952)|
| 0:32:33| We go 11 years to the reading fair that's down and things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=1953)|
| 0:32:37| So our CSC, our Concord Sailing Center subsidiary, is out in the community and they're doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=1957)|
| 0:32:43| stuff and that's how we get people to know about us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=1963)|
| 0:32:46| And usually it's with the kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=1966)|
| 0:32:48| Yeah, and I trust that you are doing all that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=1968)|
| 0:32:51| My point was that if, I can speak personally, if you've ever been in the boat business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=1971)|
| 0:32:59| so to speak, even a sailboat, I'm telling you, it is a chunk of change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=1979)|
| 0:33:04| It isn't something you can do lightly or cheaply at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=1984)|
| 0:33:09| And the fact that you all have been able to offer the service that you do for the price| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=1989)|
| 0:33:14| that you do is remarkable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=1994)|
| 0:33:16| I mean, it's remarkable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=1996)|
| 0:33:18| It's important for the non-boat ownership because a lot of clubs say, oh, you want to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=1998)|
| 0:33:23| be a sailor, you've got to bring your boat and we only take in sailors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=2003)|
| 0:33:26| We bring in people that have never sailed and they want to join the club and learn things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=2006)|
| 0:33:30| about it and we have a fleet of boats that the club owns and basically they become members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=2010)|
| 0:33:36| of the sailing club or the sailing fleet and they pay $100 and it's just for the maintenance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=2016)|
| 0:33:41| of our boats and they can reserve their boats and go out and sail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=2021)|
| 0:33:44| So you don't even have to own a sailboat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=2024)|
| 0:33:47| Right, right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=2027)|
| 0:33:48| And that's all what I think is so good about Charles, that you don't have to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=2028)|
| 0:33:54| Joe Mack, do we want to be in the marina business?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=2034)|
| 0:33:57| No, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=2037)|
| 0:34:00| I didn't think we did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=2040)|
| 0:34:01| We don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=2041)|
| 0:34:02| And I think a part of this is exactly what Mr. Ballantyne was talking about and what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=2042)|
| 0:34:09| you were talking about with regards to people knowing what's available at the club.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=2049)|
| 0:34:14| So one of the things that Mr. Ballantyne and I have been talking about is partnering with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=2054)|
| 0:34:19| organizations like the Boys and Girls Club and the McNabb Center to bring those kids| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=2059)|
| 0:34:23| that wouldn't otherwise have an opportunity to learn how to sail and give them the opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=2063)|
| 0:34:29| to do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=2069)|
| 0:34:30| I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=2070)|
| 0:34:31| At no cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=2071)|
| 0:34:32| So I think from a, and that would increase the county participation and the number of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=2072)|
| 0:34:37| kids from the different areas outside of West Knox County to give them an opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=2077)|
| 0:34:45| to participate and learn how to sail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=2085)|
| 0:34:47| So there's opportunity for growth in the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=2087)|
| 0:34:52| I think it's a great service that we absolutely could not provide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=2092)|
| 0:34:56| We couldn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=2096)|
| 0:34:57| And the property is there and it's there for, and it was deeded to Knox County for recreational| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=2097)|
| 0:35:03| purposes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=2103)|
| 0:35:04| I do have some concerns about the proposal, Commissioner Lee, on the limited time frame| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=2104)|
| 0:35:13| though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=2113)|
| 0:35:14| Just, and of course this is a massive deal, but I know in my own district we've got a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=2114)|
| 0:35:20| couple of those situations with community clubs and all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=2120)|
| 0:35:23| And it's very difficult to get the membership to buy into improvements, to buy into investing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=2123)|
| 0:35:33| money in the clubs when there's always this hanging over you that, you know, maybe in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=2133)|
| 0:35:38| a year or two you might lose it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=2138)|
| 0:35:42| And so I'm just thinking that might, in my view, that might need a little more thought| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=2142)|
| 0:35:49| as far as having it quite so time limited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=2149)|
| 0:35:53| But I'm certainly open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=2153)|
| 0:35:56| Thank you, Commissioner Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=2156)|
| 0:36:01| Commissioner Lee, I saw your light on next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=2161)|
| 0:36:03| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=2163)|
| 0:36:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=2164)|
| 0:36:10| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=2170)|
| 0:36:12| I would echo what Mr. Schoonmaker said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=2172)|
| 0:36:17| I feel like this is very exclusive to just West Knox County part of the district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=2177)|
| 0:36:23| Twenty-five years you've been paying $1,000 a year for prime real estate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=2183)|
| 0:36:31| I have an issue with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=2191)|
| 0:36:32| I just think that that's not fair to the rest of the county's children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=2192)|
| 0:36:36| I have six kids that grew up in this county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=2196)|
| 0:36:38| I never heard of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=2198)|
| 0:36:41| I doubt if anybody in Powell Halls High School knew of this program or had the opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=2201)|
| 0:36:47| to go in this program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=2207)|
| 0:36:49| And I do not think this is a very balanced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=2209)|
| 0:36:51| I do not think it's fiscally responsible to let UT be floated and not have to contribute| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=2211)|
| 0:36:59| to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=2219)|
| 0:37:01| You can increase your cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=2221)|
| 0:37:04| You can have fundraisers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=2224)|
| 0:37:05| You can charge UT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=2225)|
| 0:37:07| I think $5,000 a year is very reasonable for prime real estate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=2227)|
| 0:37:11| And five years, I think, is reasonable with inflation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=2231)|
| 0:37:15| You know, we can't project what that cost is going to be five years from now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=2235)|
| 0:37:18| I just think for the county that we need to look at for all the whole county and all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=2238)|
| 0:37:24| the kids in Knox County, not just limited to West Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=2244)|
| 0:37:29| Commissioner Lee or Madam Chair, could I speak to that briefly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=2249)|
| 0:37:31| Because it also speaks to Commissioner Schoonmaker's point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=2251)|
| 0:37:36| It shouldn't be lost in this discussion, and I think we all agree that the rate is far| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=2256)|
| 0:37:40| below where it should be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=2260)|
| 0:37:42| The one thing I would say is that the county, and I'll take responsibility for this as the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=2262)|
| 0:37:47| administration, since we're the current custodians of the office, owns a share of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=2267)|
| 0:37:53| Because what the Concord Yacht Club has been paying is what they were asked to pay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=2273)|
| 0:37:58| And so clearly, it's both appropriate from a public policy and a fiscal standpoint, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=2278)|
| 0:38:06| just from a fairness and equity standpoint, to ask them to pay more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=2286)|
| 0:38:10| And I think they're receptive to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=2290)|
| 0:38:12| But the rate that has been paid is the rate that they were asked to pay negotiated some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=2292)|
| 0:38:16| years back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=2296)|
| 0:38:17| So I wouldn't want that to be lost in the discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=2297)|
| 0:38:20| Clearly it needs to go up, and I think that both the club is receptive to that, and obviously| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=2300)|
| 0:38:26| it's important to commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=2306)|
| 0:38:28| But the rate that has been paid, it is what they were asked to pay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=2308)|
| 0:38:33| We did ask, as a consequence of this procurement, to look through all of the leases, with Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=2313)|
| 0:38:43| Benshoof looking over it, that the county has engaged in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=2323)|
| 0:38:47| Because like this one, there are lots of them tucked away out there that we may not even| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=2327)|
| 0:38:52| be aware of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=2332)|
| 0:38:53| So we asked them to look through, just to see if there are any others out there that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=2333)|
| 0:38:56| ought to be of concern, that we need to have insight to, and that we may want to renegotiate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=2336)|
| 0:39:02| to more favorable terms when they come up, so that they don't just continue to roll along| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=2342)|
| 0:39:07| on autopilot, which is, I suspect, what's happened here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=2347)|
| 0:39:11| So Perry Benshoof, the controller, and Matt Myers are working through that process, looking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=2351)|
| 0:39:16| at lease agreements that are non-GASB regulated, GASB 87, I think, but that's getting above| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=2356)|
| 0:39:23| my financial literacy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=2363)|
| 0:39:24| But we are looking through our lease inventory to make sure that we don't have any others| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=2364)|
| 0:39:29| where, as time has gone by, the terms are so unfavorable to the county as to be unacceptable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=2369)|
| 0:39:37| The other thing that came out of this discussion, and actually this is really just late last| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=2377)|
| 0:39:42| week, Director Mack is not even aware of this, and I'll make his day, the mayor has asked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=2382)|
| 0:39:47| Mr. Caldwell to look at the possibility on all of these leases with youth sports organizations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=2387)|
| 0:39:51| and youth recreational organizations at creating an object code, or a revenue code, where those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=2391)|
| 0:39:58| funds will go into an account where they'll be redirected back into park improvements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=2398)|
| 0:40:05| Usually they just go to the general fund and wash out however they wash out in a budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=2405)|
| 0:40:10| our size.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=2410)|
| 0:40:11| But parks is not funded as well as we would like, so these revenue opportunities give| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=2411)|
| 0:40:16| us a chance to invest more money back into youth sports and recreation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=2416)|
| 0:40:21| So I wanted just to mention both of those, because Commissioner Schoonmaker and Commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=2421)|
| 0:40:26| Leah, I know the rate has been a sensitive issue for both of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=2426)|

| 0:40:36| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=2436)|
| 0:40:37| Mr. VandeVeet, what is the property and the operations cost to Knox County taxpayers currently?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=2437)|
| 0:40:47| Would you repeat the question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=2447)|
| 0:40:48| I'm not sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=2448)|
| 0:40:49| How much money does it cost the Knox County taxpayers to operate the Concord Yacht Club| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=2449)|
| 0:40:54| currently?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=2454)|
| 0:40:55| It doesn't cost us anything to the best of my knowledge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=2455)|
| 0:40:59| You said that you were an all-volunteer organization?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=2459)|
| 0:41:05| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=2465)|
| 0:41:08| We can't hear anything up here unless you're talking to the mic, so we've got to bug you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=2468)|
| 0:41:12| about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=2472)|
| 0:41:13| CYC, the parent organization, is a 501C7, which is a non-profit, and 7 stands for recreational| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=2473)|
| 0:41:21| designation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=2481)|
| 0:41:22| CSC, which is our subsidiary, is a 501C3, which is education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=2482)|
| 0:41:28| So those are two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=2488)|
| 0:41:30| SHIP 300, basically, we're the chartering organization, so there's no funds there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=2490)|
| 0:41:35| UT, there's been some contributing money to UT to help with their sailing program, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=2495)|
| 0:41:41| we don't get anything from UT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=2501)|
| 0:41:43| While you may hire counselors for summer camps and things like that, you don't have a staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=2503)|
| 0:41:48| of 5 or 10 or 15 people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=2508)|
| 0:41:51| There are no people that are on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=2511)|
| 0:41:52| I'm looking at your budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=2512)|
| 0:41:53| I'm not seeing a salary line item under this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=2513)|
| 0:41:55| We have no employees to the company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=2515)|
| 0:41:57| It's all volunteer effort by the members, and for, like, sail camps, a good idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=2517)|
| 0:42:02| Those are usually summer jobs for kids, counselors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=2522)|
| 0:42:05| They get paid for coming to sail camps, and it's part of the program cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=2525)|
| 0:42:09| So their costs, we provide them food.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=2529)|
| 0:42:12| We provide different things for the sail camps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=2532)|
| 0:42:16| I guess my bigger point in here is sort of like, why are we beating up on a non-profit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=2536)|
| 0:42:22| This is an organization that's been there for 70 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=2542)|
| 0:42:26| It's a non-profit organization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=2546)|
| 0:42:27| Nobody's getting rich over this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=2547)|
| 0:42:29| Now, you can argue that the rate is not high enough, arguably.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=2549)|
| 0:42:33| You could even argue that the slips aren't at market rate, which is a programming decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=2553)|
| 0:42:39| But let's take kids from the North Shore Concord area and ask them if they ever, ever knew| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=2559)|
| 0:42:47| a thing about Three Ridges Golf Course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=2567)|
| 0:42:49| Alternatively, they've never been to the other side of the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=2569)|
| 0:42:52| This is a piece of county land that arguably should have a much bigger value, and with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=2572)|
| 0:42:57| the exception of the year of COVID where everybody went golfing, we lose hundreds of thousands| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=2577)|
| 0:43:01| of dollars every year on Three Ridges Golf Course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=2581)|
| 0:43:05| And you can't just walk up and use it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=2585)|
| 0:43:06| You got to pay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=2586)|
| 0:43:07| So nobody complains about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=2587)|
| 0:43:09| I mean, sometimes we have park use for the general, you know, civic furniture of our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=2589)|
| 0:43:15| community, and it may be a golf course in East Knoxville, or it may be a sailboat place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=2595)|
| 0:43:20| in West Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=2600)|
| 0:43:22| I'm trying to figure out why we're, you know, harping on a non-profit organization that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=2602)|
| 0:43:30| is just trying to exist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=2610)|
| 0:43:32| Now, I believe that the market rate should be higher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=2612)|
| 0:43:35| I think everybody's in agreement with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=2615)|
| 0:43:37| But if we go down this precedence, then we ought to put out an RFP on every single piece| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=2617)|
| 0:43:41| of land that Knox County owns and say, is this the highest and best use, can we get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=2621)|
| 0:43:45| the most money out of it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=2625)|
| 0:43:46| And if we start doing that, boy, God, we're going to get, it is going to be ugly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=2626)|
| 0:43:52| Should we do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=2632)|
| 0:43:53| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=2633)|
| 0:43:54| We'll have that debate later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=2634)|
| 0:43:55| But I'd offer a substitute motion at $5,000 a year lease rate with five years initial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=2635)|
| 0:44:04| term and five years renewal, because any, I know what it costs for capital projects| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=2644)|
| 0:44:09| and the planning and the time it takes to raise money as a non-profit organization and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=2649)|
| 0:44:14| the bank rates, and if you don't have enough runway, you're essentially going to stop maintaining| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=2654)|
| 0:44:20| the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=2660)|
| 0:44:21| It's going to live and survive, and then it's going to go into disrepair, and we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=2661)|
| 0:44:24| going to be right back here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=2664)|
| 0:44:25| So I'm going to offer a substitute motion, $5,000 a year, five-year initial term with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=2665)|
| 0:44:29| five-year renewal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=2669)|
| 0:44:31| There are lots of things in the contract that says if they're not doing what they're supposed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=2671)|
| 0:44:35| to be doing, then we can, you know, renegotiate this and pull the plug.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=2675)|
| 0:44:40| But if they do what they're saying they're doing, we ought to give them, like every other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=2680)|
| 0:44:43| non-profit in this community and other marinas, an opportunity to thrive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=2683)|
| 0:44:48| So that's my substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=2688)|
| 0:44:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=2689)|

| 0:45:26| If I park my car across the street at the ball field and I go down and jump that fence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=2726)|
| 0:45:33| to go fishing, what will happen to me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=2733)|
| 0:45:37| So, and I wanted to really talk to this point with regards to the fencing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=2737)|
| 0:45:43| So we have a number of properties that we lease, and essentially to community parks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=2743)|
| 0:45:50| and then AYSO soccer properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=2750)|
| 0:45:53| And all those properties have gates on them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=2753)|
| 0:45:56| And they have gates because if they didn't have gates, people would drive through and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=2756)|
| 0:46:00| they'd make donuts and things on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=2760)|
| 0:46:02| But that doesn't mean that the property is necessarily closed to the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=2762)|
| 0:46:08| We always try to make a means for any citizen in Knox County to have access to those properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=2768)|
| 0:46:16| So this is something that we try to work towards with all of our leases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=2776)|
| 0:46:20| So with regards to that, it's the same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=2780)|
| 0:46:24| If you wander onto that property and vandalize something, there's consequences to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=2784)|
| 0:46:30| Well, I'm not going to wander on it to vandalize it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=2790)|
| 0:46:32| I'm going to wander on it to go fishing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=2792)|
| 0:46:34| I'm a Knox County citizen, but I can't go across that gate unless I pay $25 initiation fee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=2794)|
| 0:46:41| and $300 and some odd dollars a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=2801)|
| 0:46:44| Oh, no, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=2804)|
| 0:46:45| You can go on the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=2805)|
| 0:46:47| It's not – the gate's there really for protection and security purposes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=2807)|
| 0:46:52| But any Knox County citizen can go on that property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=2812)|
| 0:46:55| Mr. Ballentine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=2815)|
| 0:46:57| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=2817)|
| 0:46:59| Microphone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=2819)|
| 0:47:02| Who invented microphones anyway?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=2822)|
| 0:47:05| Basically, I can tell you the story, short story.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=2825)|
| 0:47:08| When our gate went out by lightning strike and it was out for nine months,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=2828)|
| 0:47:13| we had people trying to launch boats there, which they abandoned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=2833)|
| 0:47:17| We had motorcycle gangs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=2837)|
| 0:47:19| We had outboards stolen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=2839)|
| 0:47:20| We had boats stolen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=2840)|
| 0:47:22| A lot of stuff because we're just sitting there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=2842)|
| 0:47:24| People see it's a page fence, and the gate was open for nine months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=2844)|
| 0:47:29| And we said we have to get the gate fixed because we need to protect the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=2849)|
| 0:47:34| that our members have there at the club, and we need to keep –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=2854)|
| 0:47:37| so if someone wants to come on the property and it's not a member, they can do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=2857)|
| 0:47:41| but they do it usually as a guest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=2861)|
| 0:47:44| That's the normal way that they come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=2864)|
| 0:47:46| Now, when the gate was open, people would walk the new greenway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=2866)|
| 0:47:50| and come in and use our bathrooms and sit down and talk to us and everything else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=2870)|
| 0:47:53| That was okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=2873)|
| 0:47:55| It's the bad actors that did damage and harm to the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=2875)|
| 0:48:00| that the gate is supposed to protect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=2880)|
| 0:48:02| When we have certain events on weekends, the gate's open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=2882)|
| 0:48:05| When we have other events – but again, if you wanted to come and do that as my guest,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=2885)|
| 0:48:11| and you wanted to come over there and fish, you could,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=2891)|
| 0:48:14| albeit there's a lot of places where you can go fish without a gate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=2894)|
| 0:48:19| But if you wanted to, you could come as a guest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=2899)|
| 0:48:22| But we just can't open it up to the public because we're –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=2902)|
| 0:48:25| and it's no different than the Concord Marina LLC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=2905)|
| 0:48:29| You can't walk on those sides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=2909)|
| 0:48:30| I don't care about Concord LLC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=2910)|
| 0:48:32| Well, it's in the park. It's a tenant, just like us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=2912)|
| 0:48:34| So you're not allowed to go there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=2914)|
| 0:48:36| You just said what we all know, that it's a private club,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=2916)|
| 0:48:40| and the only way I can get on your private club is as a guest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=2920)|
| 0:48:44| That is not Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=2924)|
| 0:48:47| Mr. Mack, Mr. Mendevate, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=2927)|
| 0:48:50| It's not right for a Knox County taxpayer not to be able to use that park| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=2930)|
| 0:48:56| and have to pay a $25 fee and initiation fee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=2936)|
| 0:49:01| and $300 and soon-to-be, as Mr. Ballantyne told me, $500 a month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=2941)|
| 0:49:07| It's not right that a taxpayer has to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=2947)|
| 0:49:10| It's just there's no way you can convince me that it's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=2950)|
| 0:49:14| It's not right. They need –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=2954)|
| 0:49:19| Let me speak while Joe is looking at the lease to that, Mr. Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=2959)|
| 0:49:24| A concern, and these are good questions to explore,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=2964)|
| 0:49:26| and we've been discussing them all week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=2966)|
| 0:49:28| but we do want to be mindful about what precedent we set with this organization| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=2968)|
| 0:49:36| because we also do have Concord Marina, and it is as well locked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=2976)|
| 0:49:42| So what I would submit to this body is whatever the standard is for one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=2982)|
| 0:49:46| will need to be the standard for the other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=2986)|
| 0:49:49| because I'm not aware of any basis upon which we might draw a distinction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=2989)|
| 0:49:53| So if that is pedestrian access or that sort of thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=2993)|
| 0:49:58| I think it does need to be consistent between the two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=2998)|
| 0:50:01| The other consideration that I just throw before the body, and I don't disagree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=3001)|
| 0:50:07| I think that having public access to the facilities is vitally important,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=3007)|
| 0:50:13| but both of these organizations will purchase general liability coverage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=3013)|
| 0:50:17| and those insurers will have some expectation as to what controls they have in place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=3017)|
| 0:50:23| in order to prevent potential losses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=3023)|
| 0:50:27| and I think one of those is going to be how do you manage your access.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=3027)|
| 0:50:30| So those are the questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=3030)|
| 0:50:32| I do not have the answers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=3032)|
| 0:50:34| but I do think those are questions that ought to be on the mind of commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=3034)|
| 0:50:37| as we consider this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=3037)|
| 0:50:42| Mr. Ballentine, I ask you for your three years of IRS returns,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=3042)|
| 0:50:51| and you said you would get them to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=3051)|
| 0:50:53| I have not received them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=3053)|
| 0:50:54| Have you sent them, and they just went to my junk mail?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=3054)|
| 0:50:56| I sent the year end 2001 and January through October 2002.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=3056)|
| 0:51:02| That's your income and expense report that I asked our treasurer to produce,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=3062)|
| 0:51:06| and it got emailed and shared,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=3066)|
| 0:51:09| and I also included our bank accounts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=3069)|
| 0:51:13| and I put down there an explanation, if you got the email on that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=3073)|
| 0:51:16| an explanation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=3076)|
| 0:51:17| We have money, but $60,000 of it belongs to the members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=3077)|
| 0:51:22| because they had to buy a bond when they came on board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=3082)|
| 0:51:25| It's the old thing about you buy a bond when you join a club,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=3085)|
| 0:51:28| and that gives you some connection to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=3088)|
| 0:51:30| So we can't touch that money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=3090)|
| 0:51:31| Then there's money in another brokerage account,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=3091)|
| 0:51:36| which is the auxiliary fleet money, which is $107,000, $108,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=3096)|
| 0:51:41| because when we go to fix a dock, I'll give you an example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=3101)|
| 0:51:45| The West dock, which is the furthest one going into the cove, was done 2010.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=3105)|
| 0:51:51| It's got 46 slips on it, and we paid $135,000 to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=3111)|
| 0:51:56| I understand that, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=3116)|
| 0:51:58| My question is, will you send the IRS returns for the last three years, yes or no?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=3118)|
| 0:52:04| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=3124)|
| 0:52:07| I mean, you know, we have other issues that need to be resolved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=3127)|
| 0:52:12| What are you looking for?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=3132)|
| 0:52:14| I'm looking for those returns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=3134)|
| 0:52:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=3136)|
| 0:52:17| I mean, your financials, you sent one financials,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=3137)|
| 0:52:20| but then two days, three days later,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=3140)|
| 0:52:23| you sent your bank statements after we come out and visited you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=3143)|
| 0:52:27| No, I changed some of the things, like the sales tax was not the one I changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=3147)|
| 0:52:32| I changed the property tax because we made a miscalculation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=3152)|
| 0:52:35| So I made some adjustments to what I sent out before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=3155)|
| 0:52:39| You know, like you and I talked that morning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=3159)|
| 0:52:40| it's easier for your accountant to push the button and get those returns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=3160)|
| 0:52:44| So if I provide you the thing, again, tell me what you're looking for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=3164)|
| 0:52:48| more expenditure or less expenditure?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=3168)|
| 0:52:50| No, I'm just looking for your three-year IRS returns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=3170)|
| 0:52:55| It shows all your liabilities, your statements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=3175)|
| 0:52:59| It shows everything on that form.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=3179)|
| 0:53:01| It's just the same thing that the fire departments, the nonprofits in the fire department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=3181)|
| 0:53:06| the rescue squads got to send in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=3186)|
| 0:53:08| We see them all the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=3188)|
| 0:53:10| I don't think that, actually, I don't even think $5,000 is enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=3190)|
| 0:53:17| You know, it should be $2,000 a month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=3197)|
| 0:53:21| How many open slips have you got there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=3201)|
| 0:53:24| How many what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=3204)|
| 0:53:25| How many open slips have you got today?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=3205)|
| 0:53:27| We probably have a couple, two or three or something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=3207)|
| 0:53:30| Out of the 110 wet slips, and we have moorings for 17 boats to be on mooring,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=3210)|
| 0:53:36| and I think there are a couple of mooring things that are available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=3216)|
| 0:53:39| So because it's cheap, and we make it cheap for our members, it's a convenience,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=3219)|
| 0:53:45| that they can keep their boats there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=3225)|
| 0:53:46| So there's usually a waiting list to get the wet slips in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=3226)|
| 0:53:49| So we may not have any available out of the 110 wet slips, only because they're popular.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=3229)|
| 0:53:54| You get to get on the waiting list when your rotation comes around by member's date of activity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=3234)|
| 0:54:01| Mr. Mayor, you got something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=3241)|
| 0:54:04| Al, you're on the floor for E.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=3244)|
| 0:54:07| Actually, I would like to make a suggestion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=3247)|
| 0:54:11| So we're dealing with some things that have been going on here in Knox County for many, many years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=3251)|
| 0:54:15| And it's not only this property, as we've all said, it's some other properties as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=3255)|
| 0:54:19| And we, as I think Commissioner Jenkins and others have alluded to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=3259)|
| 0:54:25| we need to look at a policy which we're talking about ad hoc issues with this particular organization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=3265)|
| 0:54:32| And I think that we need to look at a policy which would address all these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=3272)|
| 0:54:36| So it would be my suggestion that we defer this for probably a few months so that we can better address not only these issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=3276)|
| 0:54:47| but as Commissioner Frazier said, there's going to be others that are coming up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=3287)|
| 0:54:52| so that we have a better idea of being fair to everybody, including Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=3292)|
| 0:54:57| I agree with you, Mr. Mayor, that we've got to vote on an amended motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=3297)|
| 0:55:04| We can't do that until that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=3304)|
| 0:55:07| I would have made the motion to defer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=3307)|
| 0:55:09| So there's a lot of questions we need to answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=3309)|
| 0:55:13| And there will be more with some others as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=3313)|
| 0:55:16| The maker of the motion would be happy to amend it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=3316)|
| 0:55:19| I'm happy to second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=3319)|
| 0:55:21| I would be happy to amend it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=3321)|
| 0:55:23| Defer for 60 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=3323)|
| 0:55:25| Is that okay with the second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=3325)|
| 0:55:27| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=3327)|
| 0:55:28| January meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=3328)|
| 0:55:32| That would be 90 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=3332)|
| 0:55:36| Then I'll defer for 90 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=3336)|
| 0:55:38| Perfect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=3338)|
| 0:55:39| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=3339)|
| 0:55:40| You okay with that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=3340)|
| 0:55:41| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=3341)|
| 0:55:42| We would prefer 90 as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=3342)|
| 0:55:43| So if it's an option, we'd certainly appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=3343)|
| 0:55:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=3345)|
| 0:55:49| So the motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=3349)|
| 0:55:52| Substitute motion on the floor is to defer to our January meeting by Commissioner Jay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-2?start=3352)|
