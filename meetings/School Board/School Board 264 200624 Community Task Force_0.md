| 0:00:00| All right, we'll go ahead and get started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=0)|
| 0:00:01| I want to be mindful and respectful of everyone's time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=1)|
| 0:00:04| So, first of all, good afternoon, and thank you for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=4)|
| 0:00:08| Welcome to our task force meeting, and I'm so thankful for members of our task force| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=8)|
| 0:00:13| for volunteering their time, and Dr. Eskew for being a leader of our task force.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=13)|
| 0:00:20| So, before we begin, and I won't talk very long,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=20)|
| 0:00:23| we've got a commission meeting going on this afternoon, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=23)|
| 0:00:25| So, there's a little item on there about Knox County budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=25)|
| 0:00:28| So, I probably need to get over there just to make sure we get our money this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=28)|
| 0:00:34| So, I may leave before, but I'll stay as long as I can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=34)|
| 0:00:38| We've got staff over there right now answering questions from the finance committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=38)|
| 0:00:42| and then I think full commission's going to vote on budget a little bit later this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=42)|
| 0:00:47| So, I'll try to split my time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=47)|
| 0:00:49| But before we go any further, I just wanted to talk about, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=49)|
| 0:00:51| there are people that might be viewing the meeting and our agenda this afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=51)|
| 0:00:56| In a moment, Dr. Eskew's going to be introducing task force and giving members an opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=56)|
| 0:01:02| to make a few brief comments, and after that, our board chair, Mrs. Susan Horne,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=62)|
| 0:01:08| is going to be talking about the task force and what the role of the task force will be in terms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=68)|
| 0:01:14| of our preparations for opening school in the fall, and then we've got members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=74)|
| 0:01:19| of our research team here to talk about some of the things we've been discussing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=79)|
| 0:01:25| some of the options in terms of reopening, as well as the survey that was sent out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=85)|
| 0:01:31| And let me just say about the survey, wow, a lot of respondents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=91)|
| 0:01:35| I think over 30,000 respondents to the survey, so phenomenal, and we appreciate all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=95)|
| 0:01:42| of our stakeholders for participating in the survey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=102)|
| 0:01:46| I want to thank them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=106)|
| 0:01:48| Also, I want to thank our focus groups, and I've been involved in meeting with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=108)|
| 0:01:53| I have met with our teacher focus group and our principal focus groups.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=113)|
| 0:01:57| I will be meeting with our student focus group and our parent focus group before the end| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=117)|
| 0:02:02| of the week's over, and then our research department also had an interview with the focus group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=122)|
| 0:02:08| So I want to thank our focus group members for their participation in a couple of meetings with us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=128)|
| 0:02:15| and then also again, Dr. Eskew, I want to thank you for leading the task force| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=135)|
| 0:02:22| and the task force members for providing your time, and we're looking forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=142)|
| 0:02:27| to what your insights and perspectives will be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=147)|
| 0:02:31| Also, let me just say thank you to our board of education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=151)|
| 0:02:36| We've got, and I like to say this because it's a true statement, we've got a great board of education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=156)|
| 0:02:40| They spend hundreds of hours a year just dedicating their time to serving our students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=160)|
| 0:02:49| of Knox County and our community and our staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=169)|
| 0:02:52| So just to say thank you to our board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=172)|
| 0:02:53| I know I've got Ms. Horne, she'll be presenting in a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=173)|
| 0:02:56| Also, Ms. Christy, Ms. Christy Christy represents the ninth district is here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=176)|
| 0:03:01| so I want to make sure I introduce you, Ms. Christy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=181)|
| 0:03:06| So I don't know if any other board members are here or not, but to those that are watching,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=186)|
| 0:03:12| I appreciate you watching this afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=192)|
| 0:03:17| And I think I can speak on behalf of the board that we do value, appreciate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=197)|
| 0:03:21| and value all the input we're getting from our stakeholders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=201)|
| 0:03:24| We're talking to lots of people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=204)|
| 0:03:26| I say lots of people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=206)|
| 0:03:27| We're talking to the health department, also talking with the mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=207)|
| 0:03:31| We're talking with the Department of Education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=211)|
| 0:03:35| So we're talking, of course, the governor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=215)|
| 0:03:38| The governor is the main person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=218)|
| 0:03:40| If he says you're not going to school, we wouldn't go to school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=220)|
| 0:03:42| That's not going to happen, I don't believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=222)|
| 0:03:44| But all of our focus right now is reopening schools in the fall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=224)|
| 0:03:49| And we just, we want to make sure when we do that, that we're considering the health| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=229)|
| 0:03:54| and welfare of our students, our staff and the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=234)|
| 0:03:58| So open schools, but do it in a way so that it's a safe opening for everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=238)|
| 0:04:05| So that's the primary goal for us, to be in school this fall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=245)|
| 0:04:11| And unless somebody tells us with the authority to do so that you're not going to be in school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=251)|
| 0:04:16| that's the plan right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=256)|
| 0:04:18| So what we want to talk about is how does that look.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=258)|
| 0:04:21| It's going to be different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=261)|
| 0:04:22| We're going to need parents to understand, and we'll get the guidelines out, but to understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=262)|
| 0:04:28| the guidelines and to work with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=268)|
| 0:04:30| It's going to be different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=270)|
| 0:04:31| You know, just as all of our lives have been different the last few months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=271)|
| 0:04:37| We know our kids need to be, and our students need to be back in school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=277)|
| 0:04:41| And that's what, with learning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=281)|
| 0:04:43| So that's what we're shooting for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=283)|
| 0:04:45| The backup plan, if something were to happen, we're now, we'll be a one-to-one school district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=285)|
| 0:04:51| this fall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=291)|
| 0:04:52| So we'll be able to introduce new learning through remote learning, if you will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=292)|
| 0:04:58| We're providing some training opportunities for teachers and so forth this summer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=298)|
| 0:05:02| So that's kind of a backup plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=302)|
| 0:05:06| And even if we do, when we do open, one-to-one is still a good, is really good for our school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=306)|
| 0:05:11| district because it introduces technology to kids at an earlier age.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=311)|
| 0:05:15| It will also give us some opportunities for extending the school day, if you will, or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=315)|
| 0:05:22| extending the school year for students to take some online courses, which is going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=322)|
| 0:05:26| be something we haven't been able to offer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=326)|
| 0:05:29| But I'd like to say this, too, because our teachers, the very best learning takes place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=329)|
| 0:05:33| with the teacher in the classroom with his or her students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=333)|
| 0:05:37| So that's the primary way we want to provide the educational opportunities to our students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=337)|
| 0:05:44| So again, the task force is representing the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=344)|
| 0:05:50| As I said, we're listening to all kinds of stakeholders, students, parents, teachers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=350)|
| 0:05:54| principals, the other organizations that I mentioned, and then the community input where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=354)|
| 0:06:00| the task force comes in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=360)|
| 0:06:01| So again, just looking forward to working with you all and hearing what comes in terms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=361)|
| 0:06:08| of insights and perspectives from the task force.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=368)|
| 0:06:11| So having said all that, I'll get out of the way here, but I wanted to introduce Dr. Eskews,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=371)|
| 0:06:16| president of the Alliance for Better Nonprofits, previously served in a top leadership role| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=376)|
| 0:06:20| with the University of Tennessee and the East Tennessee Foundation and St. Mary's and Mercy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=380)|
| 0:06:25| Health System.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=385)|
| 0:06:26| So please join me in a round of applause for welcoming Dr. Eskews.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=386)|
| 0:06:30| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=390)|
| 0:06:31| Thank you, Superintendent Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=391)|
| 0:06:36| We really appreciate your even being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=396)|
| 0:06:38| When your budget's on the line, that's a really big priority, and all the teachers in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=398)|
| 0:06:43| room are really happy you're going to leave here and go fight for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=403)|
| 0:06:46| So we're all grateful that you're here, and thank you for those kind words.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=406)|
| 0:06:51| The first thing I want to do tonight is have everybody have the opportunity to introduce| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=411)|
| 0:06:56| themselves, and I'm going to ask you to answer one question as we go around the table, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=416)|
| 0:07:02| that question is, why in the world did you say yes when you were asked to be on this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=422)|
| 0:07:07| task force?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=427)|
| 0:07:08| So Mr. Gillenwater, why don't we start with you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=428)|
| 0:07:13| My name is Brandon Gillenwater.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=433)|
| 0:07:15| I represent, I guess, the 9th District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=435)|
| 0:07:18| I've had two children go through Knox County Schools and have a third in 7th grade at South| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=438)|
| 0:07:23| Doyle Middle School, and so I come from a family of educators.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=443)|
| 0:07:27| I'm in the business world, but certainly love educators.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=447)|
| 0:07:31| I was talking to a friend the other day, and he said the industry he was in, they said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=451)|
| 0:07:36| he thought that was the 8th one in the world.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=456)|
| 0:07:37| I was just telling Dr. Eskew, I think education is the 8th one in the world.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=457)|
| 0:07:41| How you all process everybody, and busing, I mean, it's unreal, and so how much we appreciate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=461)|
| 0:07:46| you, but a chance to be involved in helping maybe shape what it looks like is an exciting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=466)|
| 0:07:51| opportunity in such a strange time, but I think we need to look at it with a positive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=471)|
| 0:07:56| light, and we can figure it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=476)|
| 0:07:58| That's why I did that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=478)|
| 0:07:59| Good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=479)|
| 0:08:00| And we're going to give you a chance for one shameless promotion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=480)|
| 0:08:01| What's your business?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=481)|

| 0:17:56| leaders who give additional insight about the reopening process and serve as one more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=1076)|

| 0:18:11| Each of these task members brings a unique perspective to the table and a wealth of feedback,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=1091)|
| 0:18:17| questions, and concerns that have been raised with the people in their spheres of influence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=1097)|
| 0:18:24| These data points will be of great benefit as KCS finalizes decisions, and as a school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=1104)|
| 0:18:31| board member, one of the biggest things that I've learned is how difficult it is to make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=1111)|
| 0:18:36| decisions that affect so many people, so we appreciate you helping in this process, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=1116)|
| 0:18:43| I'm grateful to Dr. Askew for leading us, and the task members for saying yes, and I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=1123)|
| 0:18:49| thankful that you have those relationships with your board members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=1129)|
| 0:18:53| We certainly want to get our students back in school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=1133)|
| 0:18:57| What we've seen, as Superintendent Thomas said, students learn when they're in their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=1137)|
| 0:19:03| classrooms with their teachers, and so our teachers, I think, you know, we already knew| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=1143)|
| 0:19:07| our teachers were vitally important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=1147)|
| 0:19:10| Our teachers are so, so important to our students, and so that's why we're glad you're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=1150)|
| 0:19:17| here, so we can get our students back in a safe manner, and keep in mind, we're not asking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=1157)|
| 0:19:23| that this group make a formal presentation to the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=1163)|
| 0:19:27| It's the superintendent's job at the end of the day to make those determinations on how| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=1167)|
| 0:19:32| we will go back to school, but as you review the data and the surveys and the focus groups,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=1172)|
| 0:19:40| he would welcome your suggestions, your insights, the community insight you've had from the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=1180)|
| 0:19:47| people that are in your circles, and so we really value your feedback, and we're glad| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=1187)|
| 0:19:52| you're here, so with that, let's get started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=1192)|
| 0:19:55| Thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=1195)|
| 0:19:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=1196)|
| 0:19:57| Yes, I'm thankful that, well, first of all, Ms. Horn, the fact that you're on the school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=1197)|
| 0:20:03| board and willing to chair that makes you a hero in most of our minds, so thank you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=1203)|
| 0:20:08| for doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=1208)|
| 0:20:09| I also wanted to just reiterate that the school board has not asked us to come up with a series| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=1209)|
| 0:20:18| of formal recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=1218)|
| 0:20:21| That's been a little bit of a misunderstanding for some folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=1221)|
| 0:20:25| They have asked us, however, to give them our insights, our observations, whatever we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=1225)|
| 0:20:29| can bring as a result of our reviewing the data that is about to be presented to us and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=1229)|
| 0:20:36| that you received this afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=1236)|
| 0:20:39| One thing that we might want to consider doing is perhaps coming up with a series of questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=1239)|
| 0:20:46| that would be essential to be able to be answered before a decision is made, and that's one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=1246)|
| 0:20:54| way that I've kind of approached the data when I looked at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=1254)|
| 0:20:57| What do I need to know?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=1257)|
| 0:20:59| What would the school superintendent need to know?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=1259)|
| 0:21:01| What would the board need to know as they start to consider the decisions they make?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=1261)|
| 0:21:06| I'll also have to say I've spent a lot of time teaching developmental psychology and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=1266)|
| 0:21:11| we all crave black and white answers and there aren't, so we're all just going to do the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=1271)|
| 0:21:16| best we can and get our hearts right and give them the best observations we can give them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=1276)|
| 0:21:22| With that, I'm pleased to recognize the Knox County Schools Director of Research Evaluation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=1282)|
| 0:21:28| and Assessment, Steve Rutter, who will present us with a presentation related to opening| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=1288)|
| 0:21:35| scenarios and then we'll go into the presentation of survey results, both quantitative and qualitative results.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=1295)|
| 0:21:44| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=1304)|
| 0:21:48| The person that was supposed to do this little segment is my boss, John Roswick, but he's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=1308)|
| 0:21:52| out of town this week, so he asked me if I would step in and talk about the three reopening| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=1312)|
| 0:21:57| scenarios that are on the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=1317)|
| 0:22:02| The first one is the traditional return to school, with some additional safety measures| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=1322)|
| 0:22:07| implemented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=1327)|
| 0:22:08| So we're talking about things like wearing masks, temperature checks, social distancing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=1328)|
| 0:22:13| as much as we can inside of the buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=1333)|
| 0:22:15| So that's kind of the primary option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=1335)|
| 0:22:18| So sort of the contingency plans to that are, the second option is to be fully online.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=1338)|
| 0:22:28| That is that KCS, we're going to deploy one-to-one devices and teachers teach in an online format| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=1348)|
| 0:22:35| and students work 100% from home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=1355)|
| 0:22:38| So the third option on the table is a hybrid of those two, and that is where essentially| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=1358)|
| 0:22:45| half the students are physically present in the school building one day, or on the day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=1365)|
| 0:22:50| and then half of them are at home working, and then the next day they switch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=1370)|
| 0:22:56| So I will say this, on the traditional return to school, we do plan to have a virtual model| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=1376)|
| 0:23:01| for people who don't feel comfortable sending their students to school physically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=1381)|
| 0:23:08| So are there any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=1388)|
| 0:23:10| I know that's kind of a really high-level view of what we're talking about, but that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=1390)|
| 0:23:15| pretty much it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=1395)|
| 0:23:16| I do have a question just on the hybrid model.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=1396)|
| 0:23:21| I've expressed this before, and I think a number of people share this concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=1401)|
| 0:23:26| The pedagogy involved in teaching in-person and teaching online are so dramatically different| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=1406)|
| 0:23:34| that I would love to hear at some point, whether it's right now or at some point, I would love| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=1414)|
| 0:23:40| to hear if we plan to ask teachers in that model to be managing an in-person classroom| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=1420)|
| 0:23:49| and an online, or whether there will be dedicated teachers who will just do the online versus| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=1429)|
| 0:23:55| in-person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=1435)|
| 0:23:56| That's just a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=1436)|
| 0:23:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=1437)|
| 0:23:58| Rene, can you write that down, because I think that's a question for the Assistant Superintendent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=1438)|
| 0:24:03| of Curriculum and Instruction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=1443)|
| 0:24:05| And he should be back in town by the next meeting, so he could answer it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=1445)|
| 0:24:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=1448)|
| 0:24:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=1449)|
| 0:24:10| So I'm going to step into the survey results, and I'm going to apologize to a lot of people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=1450)|
| 0:24:14| in the room here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=1454)|
| 0:24:16| This screen is going to be difficult to see in a lot of cases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=1456)|
| 0:24:20| So all the things that we're looking at are already online.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=1460)|
| 0:24:23| If you have a device with you, you can go ahead and pull that up if you want to right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=1463)|
| 0:24:26| now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=1466)|
| 0:24:27| You can find them at knoxschools.org forward slash connect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=1467)|
| 0:24:32| So there should be several documents there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=1472)|
| 0:24:35| One is part of the survey results that we're looking at here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=1475)|
| 0:24:41| There should be a copy of the survey items there, and then a full release.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=1481)|
| 0:24:45| The full release is an extensive document that's out there, and it is a complete disaggregation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=1485)|
| 0:24:51| of the data.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=1491)|
| 0:24:52| So it is like well over 150 pages long, and there's a lot to dig through there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=1492)|
| 0:24:58| So I just wanted to point that out for everyone else in the room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=1498)|
| 0:25:02| So this project was a little bit unique for my department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=1502)|
| 0:25:07| Normally, I was telling Mr. Hunley, we're involved in the research design on the front| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=1507)|
| 0:25:13| end, and then we do a lot of data analysis on the back end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=1513)|
| 0:25:20| So because of a lot of reasons, this project was sort of brought to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=1520)|
| 0:25:26| We were presented with the survey subjects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=1526)|
| 0:25:27| We helped them refine the questions a little bit, and of course, we kind of govern the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=1527)|
| 0:25:34| platform that serves those surveys out to the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=1534)|
| 0:25:39| So the hard part is they ask us to keep our analysis of the data to a minimum so that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=1539)|
| 0:25:46| we're trying not to influence your perception of what you see here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=1546)|
| 0:25:50| So that's difficult for me to turn off, so I'm probably going to step over that line| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=1550)|
| 0:25:54| a couple times, and if you don't agree, you can just ignore what I say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=1554)|
| 0:26:02| So like I said, this survey was out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=1562)|
| 0:26:05| It was a very short timeline to get it done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=1565)|
| 0:26:08| We started talking about it in the last part of May, and it was made active on June 1st,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=1568)|
| 0:26:14| and it ran through June 19th, which was Friday evening, right, this past Friday evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=1574)|
| 0:26:21| So like you've heard a couple times already, there was just over 30,000 responses, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=1581)|
| 0:26:27| a large portion of those were people identified as parents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=1587)|
| 0:26:33| So that's about 82% of the responses were parents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=1593)|
| 0:26:36| So because of that, that's one of the reasons why you have the data in front of you today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=1596)|
| 0:26:41| disaggregated the way it is, is because the parent voice is so loud in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=1601)|
| 0:26:47| When you look at overall aggregated results, mostly what you're looking at is the parent voice, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=1607)|
| 0:26:52| So we disaggregated it by the groups you see behind me, parent, students, teachers, administrators.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=1612)|
| 0:27:00| And then there's another column out there that's other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=1620)|
| 0:27:04| So that was kind of a decision we made to, we combined a couple of small groups together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=1624)|
| 0:27:09| What, the other?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=1629)|
| 0:27:12| So the other, it would be anyone who responded, none of the other groups fit me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=1632)|
| 0:27:18| or they were central office employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=1638)|
| 0:27:21| Those two groups are combined.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=1641)|
| 0:27:23| And the survey was available to anyone who wanted to go on the website and fill it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=1643)|
| 0:27:27| So there were community people who filled it out that didn't fit in any of those categories.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=1647)|
| 0:27:32| Right. So, yeah, like that question you just said, it was, the way we administered the survey,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=1652)|
| 0:27:38| it was just a public web link.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=1658)|
| 0:27:41| We emailed it out to about 80,000 people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=1661)|
| 0:27:43| That was to primary parent email addresses that we had in our database.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=1663)|
| 0:27:49| It was to all Knox County employees, to students in grades 9 through 11.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=1669)|
| 0:27:56| We had, we can't send it to really young, it's against the law to send it to really young people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=1676)|
| 0:28:01| And then we also advertised, Mr. Thomas sent it out a couple of times on some of his missives that he sends out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=1681)|
| 0:28:10| And then we advertise it on our website and via social media.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=1690)|
| 0:28:14| So just to give you some perspective, like when we're talking about 30,000 responses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=1694)|
| 0:28:18| that is, generally when we do a parent survey, we get about 6,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=1698)|
| 0:28:22| So this is like five times what we normally receive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=1702)|
| 0:28:24| So people have opinions about this, and they care about it a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=1704)|
| 0:28:29| Was there a way to know if someone took it twice, multiple times?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=1709)|
| 0:28:33| Yeah, so that's what was my next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=1713)|
| 0:28:35| I was going to say, because of the way we did this, there's some limitations to this data.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=1715)|
| 0:28:39| One of them is that like somebody could have responded multiple times to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=1719)|
| 0:28:43| The other thing is, it's the problem with all voluntary surveys, right, like the response bias, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=1723)|
| 0:28:49| So there's a chance that the people who decide not to respond or the people who can't respond for some reason,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=1729)|
| 0:28:56| like if those people hold a significantly different viewpoint than what's presented here, we don't know that, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=1736)|
| 0:29:03| So that's something to keep in the back of your mind when you're looking at this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=1743)|
| 0:29:11| Okay, so I'm just going to step through some of these items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=1751)|
| 0:29:17| So the first item on the survey was asking people about the three options that we just talked about a minute ago, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=1757)|
| 0:29:27| Option A is physically in the school building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=1767)|
| 0:29:32| Option B is fully online.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=1772)|
| 0:29:35| And option C is the hybrid model.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=1775)|
| 0:29:38| So the blue – so these are stack bar charts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=1778)|
| 0:29:41| So each column represents one group of people, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=1781)|
| 0:29:45| So the blue segments represent the proportion of that group that responded,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=1785)|
| 0:29:52| like the group that responded they would prefer to be physically in the building, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=1792)|
| 0:29:58| The purple segments are people who responded they would prefer to be in the hybrid model.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=1798)|
| 0:30:07| And the teal one is all online.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=1807)|
| 0:30:11| So you can see across there, like roughly 50 to 54 percent of people prefer to be physically in the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=1811)|
| 0:30:21| And then the hybrid model was the second most selected choice, and it was, you know, in the 30s across the groups.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=1821)|
| 0:30:31| So you can see that the administrators are a little less certain about being physically in the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=1831)|
| 0:30:39| So I'm about to break my promise right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=1839)|
| 0:30:44| So I'm going to interject some of the things that were discussed in the focus groups that I was in along the way, if that's all right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=1844)|
| 0:30:52| So, you know, the reticence of administrators and teachers to be physically back in the building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=1852)|
| 0:30:59| like that was – it's not that they don't want to be back in the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=1859)|
| 0:31:03| What they have – they have angst – there's a lot of angst over not knowing right now what we're going to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=1863)|
| 0:31:08| because they feel like they should be planning for what we're going to do right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=1868)|
| 0:31:12| And there's also a lot of stress on their part because they don't know what – to what level –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=1872)|
| 0:31:22| if we're physically in the building and we have these safety measures in place, like to what level are we going to have to adhere to those?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=1882)|
| 0:31:29| So essentially, am I going to be expected to adhere to something that I can't physically do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=1889)|
| 0:31:35| So that may be why that response is a little bit lower.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=1895)|
| 0:31:39| Do you mean making five-year-olds keep a face mask on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=1899)|
| 0:31:42| Or stay six feet apart, right? Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=1902)|
| 0:31:45| So, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=1905)|
| 0:31:49| All right, so the second item on the survey was one where people could select more than one choice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=1909)|
| 0:31:56| So they could select as many of these as they wanted to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=1916)|
| 0:31:59| What it's asking is, what if any of these factors would make you more comfortable sending your kid to school in the fall, physically?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=1919)|
| 0:32:08| So you can see, like, this is sectioned off by respondent type.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=1928)|
| 0:32:13| So the top section there is for parents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=1933)|
| 0:32:16| And so if you notice, if you add up the percentages across the top, those add up to way more than 100 percent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=1936)|
| 0:32:22| and that's because they could select all of them if they wanted to, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=1942)|
| 0:32:27| So the way you would interpret, like, that blue bar in the parent section is that 48.8 percent of the parents who responded to this item selected choice A,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=1947)|
| 0:32:38| which, in this case, is the number of COVID infections in Knox County is decreasing, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=1958)|
| 0:32:46| So by far, the most frequently selected choice across the groups are A, C, and F.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=1966)|
| 0:32:54| So C was a proven virus treatment becomes available, and F is a consensus among the medical community that it's safe to go back, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=1974)|
| 0:33:04| So another way to look at this chart is that if you look vertically down, if you compare the height of the bars, you can see differences between the groups.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=1984)|
| 0:33:16| Does that make sense?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=1996)|
| 0:33:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=1998)|
| 0:33:21| The next item is a similar kind of question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=2001)|
| 0:33:24| Again, they could choose as many as they wanted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=2004)|
| 0:33:27| So this one, they were asking folks to talk about what, assuming we're going to be physically back in the building in August,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=2007)|
| 0:33:35| like, what kind of safety measures would you like to see in place?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=2015)|
| 0:33:39| So, you know, it doesn't take a statistician.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=2019)|
| 0:33:42| Like, E is by far the most selected choice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=2022)|
| 0:33:45| So that was regular disinfection of common areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=2025)|
| 0:33:51| I have a question about earlier when you said they could choose more than one section.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=2031)|
| 0:33:58| So how can you know if that percentage is accurate if people could choose more than one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=2038)|
| 0:34:04| Did you disaggregate that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=2044)|
| 0:34:07| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=2047)|
| 0:34:09| I mean, say that again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=2049)|
| 0:34:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=2052)|
| 0:34:13| So you have people that could choose more than one option, right, for opening?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=2053)|
| 0:34:18| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=2058)|
| 0:34:19| So you said they could choose more than one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=2059)|
| 0:34:21| But when we see the data, I mean, we're not going to know if that percentage is accurate if people chose more than one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=2061)|
| 0:34:30| and that piece isn't disaggregated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=2070)|
| 0:34:34| I mean, you could have teachers crossing over and selecting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=2074)|
| 0:34:38| They would be counted in both categories.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=2078)|
| 0:34:40| So they would be in the parent category and the teacher category.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=2080)|
| 0:34:43| Is that what you were saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=2083)|
| 0:34:44| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=2084)|
| 0:34:45| So you disaggregated that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=2085)|
| 0:34:46| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=2086)|
| 0:34:48| Does that make sense?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=2088)|
| 0:34:50| What she's asking is if somebody is a parent and a teacher, where are they represented in this chart?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=2090)|
| 0:34:56| They're represented in two places.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=2096)|
| 0:34:58| They're represented in the parent section and the teacher section.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=2098)|
| 0:35:00| Was there another question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=2100)|
| 0:35:02| No, that was me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=2102)|
| 0:35:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=2104)|
| 0:35:05| Very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=2105)|
| 0:35:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=2106)|
| 0:35:07| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=2107)|
| 0:35:08| Could you go back to page five and explain?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=2108)|
| 0:35:10| Because I'm really, really interested in the teachers' response| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=2110)|
| 0:35:17| to the survey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=2117)|
| 0:35:19| Go back to page five and explain the 59.2%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=2119)|
| 0:35:25| So what that means is like if all the people, all the teachers that answered this item, 59.2% of them said that, yeah, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=2125)|
| 0:35:37| Other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=2137)|
| 0:35:41| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=2141)|
| 0:35:42| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=2142)|
| 0:35:43| I'm curious about the response, I, on page five, I, the one about other surrounding counties are in session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=2143)|
| 0:35:52| I think the majority of the messages and kind of comments I've gotten from people in my social circle, it's always, well, look what Blount County is doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=2152)|
| 0:36:00| It's every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=2160)|
| 0:36:02| This is who's announced what they're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=2162)|
| 0:36:03| So I'm surprised.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=2163)|
| 0:36:05| Maybe that's so low because no one had really announced yet, and maybe no one else is getting that information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=2165)|
| 0:36:10| But I feel like every day someone else announces, I get kind of a new flood of messages of like, look, they've already announced what they're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=2170)|
| 0:36:16| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=2176)|
| 0:36:18| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=2178)|
| 0:36:19| The one I'm, to be honest, like, again, this is Steve Rutter's opinion, like opinion here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=2179)|
| 0:36:25| But the one I was kind of shocked at was Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=2185)|
| 0:36:28| Like the parents, Jay, like 29% of parents said no new measures are necessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=2188)|
| 0:36:33| We're okay doing what we've been doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=2193)|
| 0:36:36| That was a big shock to me, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=2196)|
| 0:36:38| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=2198)|
| 0:36:39| I was real surprised at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=2199)|
| 0:36:43| Well, I mean, it's not surprising given the way the question was phrased.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=2203)|
| 0:36:51| So, I mean, that's, I mean, that's, you know, just 33%, which seems to be a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=2211)|
| 0:37:00| But with a question that doesn't, you know, that kind of phrases it in that form, I can see why they would think that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=2220)|
| 0:37:06| So it's kind of a logical response, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=2226)|
| 0:37:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=2231)|
| 0:37:12| Yeah, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=2232)|
| 0:37:13| I mean, it's phrased here if the number of new infections of COVID decrease.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=2233)|
| 0:37:17| So parents would perceive there would be less.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=2237)|
| 0:37:19| No, we're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=2239)|
| 0:37:20| We're talking about question five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=2240)|
| 0:37:21| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=2241)|
| 0:37:22| Which is no new measures are necessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=2242)|
| 0:37:24| I'm comfortable sending my student to school under current conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=2244)|
| 0:37:27| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=2247)|
| 0:37:28| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=2248)|
| 0:37:29| We went backwards for a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=2249)|
| 0:37:30| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=2250)|
| 0:37:32| What I've had to do is write the letters across the top just so that I can keep up with the questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=2252)|
| 0:37:38| So that might be helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=2258)|
| 0:37:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=2261)|
| 0:37:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=2263)|
| 0:37:44| Good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=2264)|
| 0:37:45| Please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=2265)|
| 0:37:46| Carry on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=2266)|
| 0:37:47| Oh, we're good?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=2267)|
| 0:37:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=2268)|
| 0:37:49| So the next question, question six, we already looked at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=2269)|
| 0:37:53| So you can see that by far the most popular choice there is regular.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=2273)|
| 0:37:57| What we're asking again is that like what safety measures do you want to see in place if we're physically back in the school building?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=2277)|
| 0:38:04| And so regular disinfection of common areas was the most by far the most selected answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=2284)|
| 0:38:11| And then the second one, it was students or temperature check before they come into the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=2291)|
| 0:38:20| And a close third was no sharing of school supplies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=2300)|
| 0:38:24| And yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=2304)|
| 0:38:26| I'll just do the top five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=2306)|
| 0:38:28| So the fourth one was limit on nonessential visitors to school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=2308)|
| 0:38:33| And then the fifth one was social distancing inside the classroom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=2313)|
| 0:38:42| I have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=2322)|
| 0:38:43| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=2323)|
| 0:38:44| Is there a reason that was phrased as students, temperatures are checked and not everybody coming into the building?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=2324)|
| 0:38:52| I don't think there was a reason for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=2332)|
| 0:38:54| Oh, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=2334)|
| 0:38:55| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=2335)|
| 0:39:00| That's certainly a policy question that we would have to ask new teachers get their temperature checked,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=2340)|
| 0:39:04| the custodians get their temperature checked, all of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=2344)|
| 0:39:07| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=2347)|
| 0:39:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=2351)|
| 0:39:12| So kind of most of the rest of the items are Likert scale items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=2352)|
| 0:39:18| So if you're not familiar with those, that is where you're asking people to rate an item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=2358)|
| 0:39:25| In this case, it's from like how much they favor it to oppose it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=2365)|
| 0:39:29| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=2369)|
| 0:39:30| So when we're looking at these charts, the blue sections are favorable responses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=2370)|
| 0:39:35| And the red sections are people in opposition of whatever we're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=2375)|
| 0:39:42| And then the yellow is a neutral.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=2382)|
| 0:39:43| So they really don't either they don't know enough or don't have an opinion on that item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=2383)|
| 0:39:48| So this one is asking people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=2388)|
| 0:39:52| The next couple of items are asking people about how do you think is the best way to make up for the stuff that for the content that we missed in the spring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=2392)|
| 0:40:00| So the first couple kind of go with these first this item and the next item kind of go with each other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=2400)|
| 0:40:06| So this one's asking people, how do you how do you feel about like instead of how do you feel about assessing and adapting as we go?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=2406)|
| 0:40:14| In other words, teachers start the year like they normally start.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=2414)|
| 0:40:17| They assess the knowledge and skill gaps in the students that they have, and they they make that up as they go along.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=2417)|
| 0:40:24| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=2424)|
| 0:40:26| So so you can see that for parents, if you add those two blue sections together, that's about that's right around 75 percent favor that approach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=2426)|
| 0:40:37| And the other the other groups are pretty close to that, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=2437)|
| 0:40:41| So there's there's a that's a pretty favorable response.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=2441)|
| 0:40:47| The next item is I'm asking the same question that I said instead of this time and saying, well, what if we what if we front load?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=2447)|
| 0:40:55| In other words, what if we set aside a block of time at the beginning of the year and teach?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=2455)|
| 0:40:59| Like if I'm a fourth grade teacher, I teach what they missed in third grade and have make it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=2459)|
| 0:41:04| So you can see like there's less blue on the screen right across all the groups.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=2464)|
| 0:41:09| So people aren't aren't as in favor of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=2469)|
| 0:41:12| And there's a lot more red.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=2472)|
| 0:41:13| So there's a lot of people, a lot of people who feel more strongly and opposed to this way of doing things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=2473)|
| 0:41:18| It's interesting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=2478)|
| 0:41:22| The students were most adamant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=2482)|
| 0:41:24| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=2484)|
| 0:41:25| They didn't want to go back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=2485)|
| 0:41:27| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=2487)|
| 0:41:28| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=2488)|
| 0:41:29| And there's there's there's actually like on these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=2489)|
| 0:41:30| There's a lot of yellow, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=2490)|
| 0:41:31| So I don't know if that means people don't don't feel like they have enough knowledge to answer that or or they just don't have don't carry their way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=2491)|
| 0:41:40| Good point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=2500)|
| 0:41:42| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=2502)|
| 0:41:43| So the next three items are are not surprising to me, but they're kind of interesting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=2503)|
| 0:41:50| So this is this is about addressing the missing content through changing of the schedules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=2510)|
| 0:41:56| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=2516)|
| 0:41:57| So this one, this one said, like, to what extent do you favor extending the school year into June?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=2517)|
| 0:42:04| So there's a lot of red here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=2524)|
| 0:42:06| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=2526)|
| 0:42:07| So the parents, the parents are a little over 50 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=2527)|
| 0:42:09| But students, teachers and administrators really do not like this idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=2529)|
| 0:42:13| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=2533)|
| 0:42:17| So this this item is asking the same same sort of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=2537)|
| 0:42:20| But it's asking, OK, if we don't extend the school year, how about we extend the school day?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=2540)|
| 0:42:25| This is even worse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=2545)|
| 0:42:26| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=2546)|
| 0:42:28| This seems like like, you know, as a former teacher, I think I would probably answer to post strongly oppose also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=2548)|
| 0:42:39| All right. And so this is the third option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=2559)|
| 0:42:42| So instead of changing the schedule, we're going to compress everything into the currently scheduled time frame for this coming school year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=2562)|
| 0:42:51| And so you can see that there's a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=2571)|
| 0:42:53| There's a lot more blue. People are a lot more in support of this idea than the other two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=2573)|
| 0:43:00| They might have any questions before I feel like I'm moving right along here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=2580)|
| 0:43:08| OK. So so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=2588)|
| 0:43:26| Thank you for that observation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=2606)|
| 0:43:30| We actually have we had several people with masks that once they took their seat, they they felt like they were safe to take it off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=2610)|
| 0:43:39| But I appreciate that. We're going to limit the conversation to the task force right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=2619)|
| 0:43:45| And afterwards, if you'd like to come and ask me something, I'm happy to relay that on to the task force.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=2625)|
| 0:43:53| OK. So most of the last few items have to do with online learning in the virtual environment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=2633)|
| 0:44:01| So this one, this particular item is asking people. Notice we took the neutral response out on these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=2641)|
| 0:44:06| So we didn't let people ride the fence on these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=2646)|
| 0:44:09| So we're asking, how concerned are you with your lack of experience with specific computer programs like Canvas or Aspen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=2649)|
| 0:44:16| If you don't know what those are, Canvas is our learning management system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=2656)|
| 0:44:20| So that's what teachers would use to interact with students in the virtual environment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=2660)|
| 0:44:25| And Aspen is that our student information system. So that's where parents and students go to check grades.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=2665)|
| 0:44:31| That's what holds our attendance and schedules and things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=2671)|
| 0:44:35| So you can see here that that's about half of the parents are somewhat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=2675)|
| 0:44:43| Someone are very concerned about about that. And then teachers and administrators are more concerned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=2683)|
| 0:44:50| Students are less concerned. It doesn't surprise me because they think they can figure it out. Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=2690)|
| 0:44:56| So I will stop on a stop here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=2696)|
| 0:44:59| Stop here. So this is something that came up in a lot of the focus groups that we talked about and talked to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=2699)|
| 0:45:06| One of them was kind of in general with the focus group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=2706)|
| 0:45:10| What one of the main themes was first, the first thing we want to do, like we want to make students safe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=2710)|
| 0:45:17| Right. So we want to make sure that that the building is safe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=2717)|
| 0:45:20| If they're going to be in the building, want to make sure it's safe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=2720)|
| 0:45:23| But there was a lot of concern behind that from principals in terms of logistical kind of like if we're going to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=2723)|
| 0:45:30| If I'm if I'm at Hardin Valley High School and I have to temperature check 2000 kids a day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=2730)|
| 0:45:37| like I'm not sure how logistically that's that's feasible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=2737)|
| 0:45:42| So. So there was that goes back to what I was talking about, like the expectations of what what teachers and principals are going to be asked to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=2742)|
| 0:45:52| So. So the next thing right behind that is, OK, it was kind of in my mind like, OK, once people are safe, then how are we going to teach them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=2752)|
| 0:46:01| And so there was a lot of concern among administrators and teachers about the online environment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=2761)|
| 0:46:07| Like they don't like a lot of the some of the teachers that we talked to kind of voice opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=2767)|
| 0:46:12| They didn't feel equipped quite yet because this is new for a lot of schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=2772)|
| 0:46:17| So. So they they feel like they needed more training in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=2777)|
| 0:46:24| They also were concerned about compliance. Right. So how do I how do I if I'm a fifth grade teacher,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=2784)|
| 0:46:31| how do I make the kid on the other side of the screen engage and comply?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=2791)|
| 0:46:36| If I if I might not even be able to see them. Right. And there may be things going on in the background.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=2796)|
| 0:46:41| So there's lots of concern just in general around virtual learning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=2801)|
| 0:46:46| So. And you'll see it kind of plays out in these in these survey results.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=2806)|
| 0:46:52| So the next item was asking about access to content specific support when you have questions like in math or science.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=2812)|
| 0:46:58| So you can see that's across the board. People are concerned about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=2818)|
| 0:47:03| I'm not trying to be funny on this. I do think it is very telling that the students are all a lot more comfortable than all the rest of us with online learning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=2823)|
| 0:47:12| Because, you know, if you have a problem with it, you can ask an eight year old and they'll figure they'll tell you what to do with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=2832)|
| 0:47:20| And so. So this one is about students being held accountable. This is what I was alluding to before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=2840)|
| 0:47:26| So you can see, you know, what is that? Eighty, 90 percent of teachers are concerned about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=2846)|
| 0:47:32| And a little bit less than the administrators are. So that's that's a very big concern for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=2852)|
| 0:47:43| And then the communication piece between teachers, students and parents like it may look different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=2863)|
| 0:47:48| So people are concerned what that might look like in a virtual environment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=2868)|
| 0:47:55| And reliable and consistent access to online services is a concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=2875)|
| 0:48:02| So more so among teachers and administrators. And I think, you know, I don't know this, but I think it might be the compliance piece.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=2882)|
| 0:48:09| Right. If I had to hold a kid accountable, you can't access this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=2889)|
| 0:48:13| So I think that's an important distinction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=2893)|
| 0:48:24| When I first read this, it was like, how do I hold a student accountable for for paying attention, for being present, for doing the homework?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=2904)|
| 0:48:35| That that's not what you just said. I think that's a good insight that it's really if if if the floor is not level,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=2915)|
| 0:48:42| how do you hold different people accountable, different students accountable when they don't have equal access to just right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=2922)|
| 0:48:50| Right. And some of them home environment may be more difficult environment to do that in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=2930)|
| 0:48:56| Absolutely. Yes. Add something. Having been teaching at UT online since March, I can tell you that Zoom, which is the platform we use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=2936)|
| 0:49:07| you can students can turn their video off and an avatar will come up and you really have no idea whether they're there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=2947)|
| 0:49:15| And you can't completely require them to be there because they're in their homes. Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=2955)|
| 0:49:19| So if you've got if we're using a platform where anybody can turn off the video,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=2959)|
| 0:49:26| there's really no way to know if they're actually there paying attention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=2966)|
| 0:49:30| So and it's super easy in a home environment just to get distracted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=2970)|
| 0:49:35| And these are adults. So I'm just saying that it's even more of an issue for younger kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=2975)|
| 0:49:43| So we when we talked, our student focus group was pretty small.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=2983)|
| 0:49:47| We could only get four. We only got four of them to meet with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=2987)|
| 0:49:51| But like one of the things they brought up was that and like she was very politic and how she how they said it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=2991)|
| 0:49:58| It was like she says, you know, I have several AP classes. That's her letting us know she's a good student. Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=2998)|
| 0:50:03| So I have several AP classes and it was hard for me to engage for five, six hours a day like at home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=3003)|
| 0:50:10| Like it was like she gets to tell you university students are probably checking out after an hour and a half just online screen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=3010)|
| 0:50:17| And that's through Zoom, which really wasn't designed for classrooms anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=3017)|
| 0:50:21| It was designed for business meetings. Yeah. About an hour and a half is pretty much all an adult who's motivated and focused can kind of tolerate with an on screen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=3021)|
| 0:50:34| Right. Yeah. Good. The other the other point of view is another another one of our focus group students that said, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=3034)|
| 0:50:42| a lot of students come to school for socialization like that's the motivation for them to show up and do things like if you take that away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=3042)|
| 0:50:49| I'm not sure what that's going to look like. That was a pretty good insight from him, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=3049)|
| 0:50:54| And that's kind of what this item is asking about. Right. Like how concerned are you with missing students?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=3054)|
| 0:50:59| Student social interactions. And so there's a lot of concern about that across the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=3059)|
| 0:51:06| And then same sort of thing. Missing hands on learning opportunities. So we're talking about things like like fine arts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=3066)|
| 0:51:14| like choir band, science labs, things like that. So people are very concerned about that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=3074)|
| 0:51:24| So this one, I'm not sure how much it will inform you guys, but I think we added it because somebody was curious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=3084)|
| 0:51:30| So with this one, we're asking folks to we this is one they can only choose one answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=3090)|
| 0:51:36| We're asking them essentially, what do you think your work situation is going to be like in August?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=3096)|
| 0:51:41| And so you can see that that a very small percentage of people think that all the caregivers are going to be working from home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=3101)|
| 0:51:49| So essentially, like they're saying, I don't think we're going to be quarantined at that point anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=3109)|
| 0:51:54| And then B, the light blue is all caregivers working outside the home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=3114)|
| 0:51:59| So so that the pretty good 40, about 45 percent of parents feel like they're going to be working outside of home at that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=3119)|
| 0:52:06| And then C is caregivers inside the home and outside the home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=3126)|
| 0:52:12| So one of maybe one of each. And then D is the caregivers are home anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=3132)|
| 0:52:18| Right. They're homemakers or whatever. All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=3138)|
| 0:52:24| So this this is kind of one of the last items that I want to talk about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=3144)|
| 0:52:31| But this is about the school buses. So this one's asking folks that if we're going back to school in August,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=3151)|
| 0:52:37| are you going to be planning on using busing services?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=3157)|
| 0:52:41| So about 30, 38 percent, 38.4 percent of parents said they they plan on using buses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=3161)|
| 0:52:49| And that that I think that our director of transportation said that's about what it usually is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=3169)|
| 0:52:58| So that's not higher or lower than. No, he was he wasn't surprised by that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=3178)|
| 0:53:03| OK, good. OK, so I'm not going to go over the last 10 pages of this, but I want to explain why they're there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=3183)|
| 0:53:12| So we're so if you look online at the full release, like it is an intimidating document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=3192)|
| 0:53:18| Right. Like it's it's there's a lot there. So it's disaggregated in every way that we could think to disaggregate things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=3198)|
| 0:53:25| So these items, these last 10 pages are the 10 items with the most variation across the groups.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=3205)|
| 0:53:32| So let me so you can kind of see. So one of the ways we disaggregated it was by zip code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=3212)|
| 0:53:38| And so so you can see one of those don't does not look like the others. Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=3218)|
| 0:53:44| Right. So we thought you all might be interested in since you were selected by board members,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=3224)|
| 0:53:49| you might be interested in specific zip codes. And we added an addendum to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=3229)|
| 0:53:54| There's the zip codes are listed on the back of your page, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=3234)|
| 0:53:57| So with a map showing the last page in the handout is a zip code map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=3237)|
| 0:54:06| So let me. So the other thing I'm going to stop there with this, do you have any questions about the survey results?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=3246)|
| 0:54:19| So, yes. Yeah. I'm sorry. I don't have my glasses on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=3259)|
| 0:54:24| I totally get it. It's all right. I'm not. I'm curious as to were there any questions about parents who have children with disabilities and health health involvement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=3264)|
| 0:54:39| There were not. There was only one item that was on the survey that isn't represented here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=3279)|
| 0:54:45| And that one had we left it off just because it really didn't have to do with opening a school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=3285)|
| 0:54:50| It was asking about how people prefer to communicate with the district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=3290)|
| 0:54:54| So that was like email, social media or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=3294)|
| 0:54:58| We have a significant I know Knox County is a significant number of students with disabilities who also have concomitant health and health impairments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=3298)|
| 0:55:07| And so they are at risk and their staff and teachers could be at risk without some kind of pretty significant procedures in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=3307)|
| 0:55:18| So I'm just that's why I'm just wondering why that's not on the survey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=3318)|
| 0:55:23| It's clearly something, though, that we would want to ask the administration to attend to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=3323)|
| 0:55:33| Thank you. We are we now have you're finished.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=3333)|
| 0:55:38| Pretty, pretty much. I was just going to say about the focus groups I've covered a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=3338)|
| 0:55:42| So I would definitely encourage you to read the summary that we provided.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=3342)|
| 0:55:46| And, you know, if I'm if I'm being super critical from a data point of view, like one of the one of the limitations of the focus groups are that they were fairly small groups.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=3346)|
| 0:55:58| And, you know, if we were doing this, if we had the time to do it like that was a big limiting factor in this whole process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=3358)|
| 0:56:05| If we had the time to do it, we would talk to a lot more focus groups to make sure that they were representative of every every group that we talked to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=3365)|
| 0:56:13| And if I had if I understood correctly, there's one more focus group that's meeting tomorrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=3373)|
| 0:56:18| And that's our partners who do child care and after school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=3378)|
| 0:56:23| That's right. OK, so we'll have those results by Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=3383)|
| 0:56:28| Yes. Well, possibly that was that discussion is kind of happening outside our office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=3388)|
| 0:56:35| So, yeah, I think it would be good to hear what they have to say because they do play such a fundamental role in a child's daily life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=3395)|
| 0:56:44| So good. But thank you for adding that group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=3404)|
| 0:56:49| They were very concerned. And so I appreciate your answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=3409)|
| 0:56:53| We have been given a whole lot of data and not a lot of time to review the data.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=3413)|
| 0:57:03| You got it all this afternoon. I got it late last night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=3423)|
| 0:57:07| And so one of the things I hope that we'll spend time doing between tonight and Monday is going through this and getting a list of questions we can ask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=3427)|
| 0:57:21| But as it relates to the rest of this evening, I'm I'm interested in hearing if there are any questions about the data or any other things that are kind of burning that you want to make sure we deal with as a group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=3441)|
| 0:57:35| As you as you we've all had several weeks. Well, we've all had a couple of weeks to contemplate what we wanted out of this group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=3455)|
| 0:57:42| So now as we've kind of got an open forum here, it's here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=3462)|
| 0:57:47| I just wanted to say I meant to mention this earlier. Like this. This survey was administered in English and Spanish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=3467)|
| 0:57:52| So it was in multiple multiple languages. So Steve's here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=3472)|
| 0:57:57| We can ask him any questions. We have key members of the administration here who can ask answer questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=3477)|
| 0:58:04| So do you have it? Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=3484)|
| 0:58:13| Can somebody talk about the recent approval from the Board of Education to become a one to one district and the appropriation of funds for computers on a one to one basis?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=3493)|
| 0:58:28| Could someone give us a little bit of information on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=3508)|
| 0:58:32| And also, I believe the dollar amount. I can't remember exactly. I think it was six to eight million dollars somewhere in that neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=3512)|
| 0:58:38| And give us a little bit of a status report on that, because I think I'd like to have some of that information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=3518)|
| 0:58:44| There's a lot to digest here. As you said, Dr. Askey, there's a whole lot to digest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=3524)|
| 0:58:49| So I think if we could get some of these other things, I think it can it can help us in the for the next meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=3529)|
| 0:58:56| Mr. Thomas, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=3536)|
| 0:59:02| Okay, is that better? Thank you. I appreciate the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=3542)|
| 0:59:06| Yes, the state, of course, received some CARES Act money, federal dollars, and Knox County received 12 to 13 million dollars was our share.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=3546)|
| 0:59:18| So we are we'll be leasing to purchase 60,000 computers, laptops, tablets and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=3558)|
| 0:59:28| Not all at one time, but our board was very concerned because we already had devices and to make sure that we get the use out of those devices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=3568)|
| 0:59:36| Let's let's do that before we purchase devices for students who who again have have usage left on those or service left on those laptops.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=3576)|
| 0:59:46| So I believe it's going to run somewhere I think in the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=3586)|
| 0:59:52| Latest number I had was about three and a half million, four million dollars, I guess, this first year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=3592)|
| 0:59:57| So we've set aside seven million dollars that CARES Act money to pay for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=3597)|
| 1:00:03| And it's five years, I believe, on this length of service on those tablets and laptops.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=3603)|
| 1:00:10| So I don't know if that answers the question or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=3610)|
| 1:00:13| But again, CARES Act money was providing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=3613)|
| 1:00:17| Without that, we just would not have had the resources to be one to one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=3617)|
| 1:00:22| And certainly we're appreciative of those funds to allow us to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=3622)|
| 1:00:27| And I think the technology piece, of course, we saw survey results about online learning and I've read articles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=3627)|
| 1:00:34| People have written articles, not just people, but research has been done and it doesn't work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=3634)|
| 1:00:40| So we know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=3640)|
| 1:00:42| We know, again, the best the best way that learning takes place is with the teacher and student in the classroom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=3642)|
| 1:00:47| So but we can't be in the situation that we're in in March either when OK, school is closed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=3647)|
| 1:00:54| What do you do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=3654)|
| 1:00:56| So we've been talking a long time about becoming one to one school district and again, just haven't had those resources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=3656)|
| 1:01:02| So even if we're not closed, as I mentioned earlier, I think it's going to really be beneficial to our students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=3662)|
| 1:01:09| and our school district to be one to one just because of those additional opportunities for online or remote learning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=3669)|
| 1:01:15| and courses you can take and things of that nature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=3675)|
| 1:01:18| So really proud of our Board of Education for supporting that and our county commission for supporting that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=3678)|
| 1:01:25| the use of those funds to get us to one to one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=3685)|
| 1:01:28| So I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=3688)|
| 1:01:31| I have a related question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=3691)|
| 1:01:34| Do we feel confident that we have the time between now and the beginning of school to get our teachers fully prepared to to to deliver the product over the computers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=3694)|
| 1:01:50| That's a that's a great question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=3710)|
| 1:01:52| And I talked with teachers yesterday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=3712)|
| 1:01:55| I guess it was met with teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=3715)|
| 1:01:57| And that's that's a concern because there's a big difference between teaching students in the classroom environment and then doing online.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=3717)|
| 1:02:05| We we're offering some training to our teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=3725)|
| 1:02:08| We've asked our teachers that they are responsible for getting twelve, twelve and a half hours of unscheduled in service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=3728)|
| 1:02:15| We've got a training program for the to provide remote learning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=3735)|
| 1:02:20| It's about seven.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=3740)|
| 1:02:21| It's worth seven and a half hours of those unscheduled insert in service hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=3741)|
| 1:02:25| So, again, we've asked teachers, if you would, to please complete that course between now and the time school starts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=3745)|
| 1:02:33| But is it ideal?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=3753)|
| 1:02:35| No, I don't think so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=3755)|
| 1:02:37| May I had been a teacher if I was all of a sudden asked to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=3757)|
| 1:02:41| OK, you're going to teach your class and then you're going to do online teaching as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=3761)|
| 1:02:45| That's a difficult task.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=3765)|
| 1:02:47| And it's it's somebody mentioned today in the press meeting said, you know, I put I put I put a class together myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=3767)|
| 1:02:53| And it took me three hours, three or four hours just to put a forty five minute online course together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=3773)|
| 1:03:01| So, you know, to ask teachers, we've got great teachers, let me tell you, and great administrators in our school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=3781)|
| 1:03:09| But, you know, you can only you can only work so hard for so long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=3789)|
| 1:03:13| And one of our administrators said another example, just like on online learning, you know, got a teacher said, hey,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=3793)|
| 1:03:20| I'm working 12 hours a day with online learning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=3800)|
| 1:03:23| So some of my students are not up at eight o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=3803)|
| 1:03:26| So, you know, guess what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=3806)|
| 1:03:27| I got to I got to teach them in the afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=3807)|
| 1:03:29| I got to teach them in the evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=3809)|
| 1:03:30| And we're spending like 12 hours, you know, trying to provide the online to to to the class.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=3810)|
| 1:03:38| So it's it's it's challenging.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=3818)|
| 1:03:41| It's difficult. It's not ideal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=3821)|
| 1:03:43| I'm just praying for a vaccine to be developed soon and get us back to normal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=3823)|
| 1:03:50| If it's ever back to normal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=3830)|
| 1:03:53| Just to bolster your report there, we've UT has been counting up the number of hours instructors take just to prepare for one class.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=3833)|
| 1:04:03| And they've come up with 250 hours just for one class.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=3843)|
| 1:04:07| That's just for preparation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=3847)|
| 1:04:09| That's not monitoring and teaching it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=3849)|
| 1:04:12| And the teaching and the responding online goes on for many hours throughout the day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=3852)|
| 1:04:18| So, yeah, lots of that's an average.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=3858)|
| 1:04:21| Right. Lots of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=3861)|
| 1:04:22| Look, there are lots of challenges with with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=3862)|
| 1:04:25| Yeah. And I guess one of the questions I think I would have is and this is something that you all are working on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=3865)|
| 1:04:30| Obviously, if you're going to the commission meeting, you know, your budget looks like you have some money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=3870)|
| 1:04:34| But I know it's a shoestring at the end of the day with all that you have to spend on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=3874)|
| 1:04:38| I would worry about resources to trying to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=3878)|
| 1:04:42| I don't know how you work out to do in both.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=3882)|
| 1:04:44| So there's questions, I think, that we're asked on the survey that we can just pop a little yes or no or maybe or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=3884)|
| 1:04:51| But trying for you to decide, do I have the financial resources to do in school splitting it both ways?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=3891)|
| 1:04:59| Do we have the resources financially?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=3899)|
| 1:05:00| So I don't covet your position, but we certainly will try to look at that some.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=3900)|
| 1:05:05| But I know because limited resources now with less money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=3905)|
| 1:05:08| So what does that look like?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=3908)|
| 1:05:10| That's a great point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=3910)|
| 1:05:11| And I don't want to take advantage of too much time here, but just to just because we've just gone through the budget process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=3911)|
| 1:05:17| And in March, you know, we were looking at a budget that was going to grow by 20 million dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=3917)|
| 1:05:23| And from from the time COVID-19 hit until till now, it evaporated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=3923)|
| 1:05:32| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=3932)|
| 1:05:33| And we ended up cutting 10 million dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=3933)|
| 1:05:35| If we have to spend in our fund balance, you know, we'll have to budget money back into fund balance to get us to 3 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=3935)|
| 1:05:42| So it's great resources, sales taxes and so forth down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=3942)|
| 1:05:48| So that's additional resources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=3948)|
| 1:05:50| So it's always a challenge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=3950)|
| 1:05:52| I wanted to piggyback quickly on Mr. Hundley's comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=3952)|
| 1:05:57| One of the questions that I have and has been brought to me out of some of the areas and halls and Copper Ridge in that area is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=3957)|
| 1:06:05| if we go one to one as we're planning to, what what are we doing to improve connectivity?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=3965)|
| 1:06:10| Are there negotiations in place with some of the providers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=3970)|
| 1:06:13| Those kind of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=3973)|
| 1:06:15| Very, very good question as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=3975)|
| 1:06:17| We did a survey just on the Internet access and it was kind of surprising.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=3977)|
| 1:06:21| About 92 percent of the folks that were surveyed indicated they had that was a plus or minus 5 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=3981)|
| 1:06:26| I think, Steve, is that right on on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=3986)|
| 1:06:29| So, again, looking at breaking it out by district where folks didn't have access.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=3989)|
| 1:06:35| So what what the plan is, is for us to this is a temporary plan, short term solution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=3995)|
| 1:06:40| Internet access would be hotspots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=4000)|
| 1:06:43| Of course, there's there's Internet connectivity around our schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=4003)|
| 1:06:47| That's a possibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=4007)|
| 1:06:48| But but again, we'd like for students to have that connection in the home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=4008)|
| 1:06:52| So so hotspots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=4012)|
| 1:06:53| Also, the chamber is working when we've got two folks on this task force, they're looking at a at it more broadly and more long term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=4013)|
| 1:07:02| Like what could it what would it take to provide Internet access to to the community?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=4022)|
| 1:07:07| So that that work is ongoing right now, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=4027)|
| 1:07:10| But but for us, the immediate solution would be be a hotspot for for our students and families.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=4030)|
| 1:07:15| Did we purchase hotspots with any of the cares money? Additional hotspots?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=4035)|
| 1:07:19| Yes. Yes. Yes, we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=4039)|
| 1:07:23| We can purchase hotspots with with cares money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=4043)|
| 1:07:27| Mr. Brown. Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=4047)|
| 1:07:29| Superintendent Thomas, if just looking at the data that we have received today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=4049)|
| 1:07:34| and thank you all from the central office for providing us with this information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=4054)|
| 1:07:39| Just from what I see on the front end, it looks as if the best way for us to service all of our kids would be to go ahead and look towards a model for going back into the classroom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=4059)|
| 1:07:51| I'm the same token with us being a one to one school district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=4071)|
| 1:07:55| Has there been any concern given to those supplies in the classroom?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=4075)|
| 1:07:59| I saw that was a response on one of the survey questions with the supplies being kept separate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=4079)|
| 1:08:06| And some of our students may have the resources to have their own supplies and keep them separate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=4086)|
| 1:08:11| So is there any consideration being given by your office to put a line item in the budget to maybe make that a more robust fund for students that may not have those resources?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=4091)|
| 1:08:21| Yes, we're looking at that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=4101)|
| 1:08:23| It's a good point because, again, touching supplies, sharing supplies, materials, making sure that we minimize that as much as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=4103)|
| 1:08:31| And also with disinfecting, cleaning and things of that nature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=4111)|
| 1:08:36| So we are looking looking at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=4116)|
| 1:08:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=4119)|
| 1:08:42| Other questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=4122)|
| 1:08:44| Can I ask one additional question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=4124)|
| 1:08:47| One of the things I know we've gotten a lot of recommendations from the state about how the reopening process should look.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=4127)|
| 1:08:54| Is there a timeline or have you heard any discussion about actual hard directives from the state as far as what the future will look like?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=4134)|
| 1:09:04| Because there is a possibility, and I think we all recognize this, that we could be transitioning from in-person school to virtual school to back to in-person school as the year progresses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=4144)|
| 1:09:16| So I'm just looking to see if there's been any discussion from the state level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=4156)|
| 1:09:21| Most of the conversation right now has been trying to make sure we can get kids back in school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=4161)|
| 1:09:26| So what does that process look like and what are the hows?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=4166)|
| 1:09:30| We talked about it a little bit with temperature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=4170)|
| 1:09:32| You've got 2,000 students coming in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=4172)|
| 1:09:34| Also, you've got staff coming in, temperature checks, the social distancing and how we're going to manage that with changing classes in the hallways and cafeterias, lunch rooms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=4174)|
| 1:09:45| We eat in the classroom. Teachers have to have duty-free lunch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=4185)|
| 1:09:48| So if students are eating in the classroom, how can we work around that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=4188)|
| 1:09:54| Maybe stretching lunch period out over a longer period of time so we could get all kids in the lunch room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=4194)|
| 1:09:59| So there's all kinds of conversations taking place with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=4199)|
| 1:10:03| But I think the state, for the most part, they've given us guidelines, followed the guidelines, talked to the health department, things that we're currently doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=4203)|
| 1:10:12| It looks like things are really geared up to get back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=4212)|
| 1:10:15| Now, you're right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=4215)|
| 1:10:16| Something could change overnight, and that's what we have to be prepared for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=4216)|
| 1:10:20| But we're asking folks to, you know, here's our best thinking at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=4220)|
| 1:10:25| Please, we know you as parents want your kids back in school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=4225)|
| 1:10:29| Our teachers want our kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=4229)|
| 1:10:30| I want our kids back in school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=4230)|
| 1:10:33| So just be prepared to do whatever we come up with in those guidelines to make sure that we get the help from parents, too, to get our kids safely back in school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=4233)|
| 1:10:44| and also make sure that we're keeping our staff safe, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=4244)|
| 1:10:49| Because there's concerns with teachers with maybe they have some type of underlying health condition that we have to be more careful there with staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=4249)|
| 1:11:01| As I sit in these focus groups, meetings, and I tell folks on the front end, hey, you've got a lot more questions than I have answers for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=4261)|
| 1:11:11| But at least knowing what those questions are helps us because we can try to work on what the answers need to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=4271)|
| 1:11:19| And that's why I appreciate so much the work you all are doing and all of our stakeholders are doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=4279)|
| 1:11:24| because that helps me and us to determine what that needs to look like when we go back to school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=4284)|
| 1:11:31| But it's a change overnight, so people need to realize that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=4291)|
| 1:11:35| Mr. Hundley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=4295)|
| 1:11:37| I was going to save this for the next time because I look forward to talking to Mr. Reiswick if he's able to be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=4297)|
| 1:11:43| But Mr. Superintendent and Mr. Chairman, I don't think anybody could have anticipated the COVID-19.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=4303)|
| 1:11:50| And like I said, no one could have been completely prepared for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=4310)|
| 1:11:55| I mean, they really couldn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=4315)|
| 1:11:57| I mean, it's just out of its dues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=4317)|
| 1:11:59| That's why they call it an awful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=4319)|
| 1:12:02| Yeah, I really believe the local, state, and federal governments have performed about as well as we could expect them to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=4322)|
| 1:12:10| I mean, we really have with what hand they've been dealt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=4330)|
| 1:12:14| I believe the Knox County Health Department has done an extraordinary job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=4334)|
| 1:12:19| Dr. Buchanan and her folks have done a great job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=4339)|
| 1:12:23| And I'm pleased with your administration that you've included a whole lot of diverse focus groups| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=4343)|
| 1:12:31| and getting a lot of opinions from a lot of folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=4351)|
| 1:12:36| But, you know, what we're talking about right now with this group, and like I said, the board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=4356)|
| 1:12:41| you're going to make a recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=4361)|
| 1:12:43| That's how it works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=4363)|
| 1:12:44| And the board is going to, you know, that's the way it should be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=4364)|
| 1:12:47| But what we're talking about right now is reopening school and how we're going to go about reopening that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=4367)|
| 1:12:53| But also I would encourage, and I know that you are working hard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=4373)|
| 1:12:57| I know you are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=4377)|
| 1:12:58| And I know you care a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=4378)|
| 1:13:01| We also need to have a plan in place if schools close down again for an extended period of time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=4381)|
| 1:13:10| that we can continue teaching our children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=4390)|
| 1:13:13| I don't believe our children, we don't need to have that lapse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=4393)|
| 1:13:18| I don't know exactly what, I don't remember what the lapse was, two months, whatever it was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=4398)|
| 1:13:23| We cannot afford to have that kind of lapse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=4403)|
| 1:13:26| And I think a lot of folks are going to have to adapt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=4406)|
| 1:13:29| And it is, you know, we are in unprecedented times now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=4409)|
| 1:13:33| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=4413)|
| 1:13:34| I mean, we just started dealing with an unprecedented pandemic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=4414)|
| 1:13:39| If you hadn't seen this in 100 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=4419)|
| 1:13:42| So I would hope that we would really look at everything, and I'm glad to see,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=4422)|
| 1:13:47| and nobody is ever going to replace a teacher in a classroom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=4427)|
| 1:13:51| That is just never going to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=4431)|
| 1:13:53| And that is the absolute best case scenario is to have a teacher teaching their children,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=4433)|
| 1:13:59| teaching their students in a classroom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=4439)|
| 1:14:02| But even spaceships have backup systems, and backup systems for backup systems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=4442)|
| 1:14:08| So I would encourage the next meeting that we have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=4448)|
| 1:14:14| I don't think anybody looks at this distance learning thing as a replacement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=4454)|
| 1:14:19| What we ought to be looking at, though, is a stopgap if we have to go through this again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=4459)|
| 1:14:25| And I wanted to get that out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=4465)|
| 1:14:27| Yeah, and I agree with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=4467)|
| 1:14:29| And just to support that, Mr. Henley, I was thinking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=4469)|
| 1:14:35| the first person to ever cross the ocean in my family was a school teacher,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=4475)|
| 1:14:38| and everybody in my family, that's the dominant profession.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=4478)|
| 1:14:41| So I am as sensitive as anybody can be who hasn't been an elementary or secondary school teacher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=4481)|
| 1:14:46| But we're asking a lot of them already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=4486)|
| 1:14:49| But I think we're going to have to put in place some kind of program that allows them to get,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=4489)|
| 1:14:58| even if we decide to go back in person in the fall,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=4498)|
| 1:15:01| that we continue the process to get them ready in case we have to stop going to school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=4501)|
| 1:15:08| And that's just an ongoing cost of doing business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=4508)|
| 1:15:12| And one other thing we need to really do, go above and beyond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=4512)|
| 1:15:16| We need to go above and beyond to make sure that all children, regardless of socioeconomic status,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=4516)|
| 1:15:24| that all children have access, equal access, okay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=4524)|
| 1:15:29| to anything that we're doing in the classroom or outside the classroom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=4529)|
| 1:15:34| And if that means providing Internet, then we need to go and ask for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=4534)|
| 1:15:38| We need to ask for those things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=4538)|
| 1:15:39| We have to have the tools if you're going to be able to have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=4539)|
| 1:15:42| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=4542)|
| 1:15:43| Ms. Craig?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=4543)|
| 1:15:45| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=4545)|
| 1:15:46| I hope I can word this the way I want this to come out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=4546)|
| 1:15:51| So it's, you know, with the survey, we ask all the questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=4551)|
| 1:15:54| Everyone shows their concern about Internet availability, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=4554)|
| 1:16:01| just with all the concerns of getting laptops and online learning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=4561)|
| 1:16:05| However, we had no option this past semester.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=4565)|
| 1:16:10| And if we would have been a one-on-one school, the teachers would have stepped up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=4570)|
| 1:16:14| It would have happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=4574)|
| 1:16:16| And my kids are fortunate enough to be at a one-to-one school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=4576)|
| 1:16:20| The grants that came out eight years ago, Bearden and West Valley were, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=4580)|
| 1:16:24| one of the West Knoxville schools that got one-to-one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=4584)|
| 1:16:27| So we sat at home with the laptops, with the teachers who have already done all the online working,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=4587)|
| 1:16:32| and our kids couldn't learn because the teachers weren't allowed to teach our kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=4592)|
| 1:16:36| And we had the access.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=4596)|
| 1:16:39| And I understand that we couldn't, you know, I understand why they couldn't do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=4599)|
| 1:16:44| However, when it happens again, and it just, we don't have a clue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=4604)|
| 1:16:50| but we're getting the laptops.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=4610)|
| 1:16:52| We're going to have them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=4612)|
| 1:16:54| So I think it's inevitable that even for snow days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=4614)|
| 1:16:58| our kids used to learn during snow days and sick days because we were one-to-one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=4618)|
| 1:17:03| So I just think that we need, you know, this information is wonderful,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=4623)|
| 1:17:07| but right now we need to go with this is what's happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=4627)|
| 1:17:10| We're getting, everyone's getting a device.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=4630)|
| 1:17:13| Now we need to, everybody needs to learn how to use it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=4633)|
| 1:17:16| Like it needs to just go from there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=4636)|
| 1:17:18| Does this make sense, what I'm saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=4638)|
| 1:17:20| It's not a matter of let's plan, let's wait and see if our kids aren't going to be in school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=4640)|
| 1:17:25| Then we'll decide what we're going to do with our laptops or our devices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=4645)|
| 1:17:28| We're getting them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=4648)|
| 1:17:29| So let's go ahead and plan that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=4649)|
| 1:17:30| So when your kids are out sick, they can continue learning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=4650)|
| 1:17:34| Great point, and yes, to all that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=4654)|
| 1:17:38| Now my concern, and I heard it a lot too, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=4658)|
| 1:17:43| my child's ready for new learning, introduced new learning, and you're not doing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=4663)|
| 1:17:46| Well, you know, one of the platforms that I actually went, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=4666)|
| 1:17:50| when I applied for superintendent, I said I want to eliminate disparities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=4670)|
| 1:17:54| And we would have been creating disparities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=4674)|
| 1:17:57| And I accept the blame.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=4677)|
| 1:18:00| You know, we should have had technology if we just had any way, form, or fashion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=4680)|
| 1:18:04| And a previous superintendent tried to do that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=4684)|
| 1:18:07| and of course funding wasn't the issue to do it at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=4687)|
| 1:18:12| But I agree with you wholeheartedly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=4692)|
| 1:18:14| I mean, we've got to provide, it's got to be accessible to all children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=4694)|
| 1:18:18| You know, the state looks at and the federal government looks at, they call them subgroups.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=4698)|
| 1:18:23| They're underrepresented groups.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=4703)|
| 1:18:24| You've got students with economic disabilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=4704)|
| 1:18:27| You've got English language learners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=4707)|
| 1:18:29| You've got students with disabilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=4709)|
| 1:18:31| You've got African American, Hispanic, Native American students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=4711)|
| 1:18:34| And when we look at our disparities, there are academic disparities there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=4714)|
| 1:18:39| They don't graduate at the same rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=4719)|
| 1:18:41| They're not reading proficiently at the same rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=4721)|
| 1:18:44| Discipline is administered in a different way too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=4724)|
| 1:18:47| So looking at all that, but to your point, when we get to be one-to-one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=4727)|
| 1:18:52| yeah, all groups, and you're right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=4732)|
| 1:18:54| I mean, if it's a snow day, a flood day, or flu, whatever the case may be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=4734)|
| 1:19:00| a way for us to provide, you know, instruction for students who are out and schools are closed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=4740)|
| 1:19:05| I think that's a whole piece of this technology and being one-to-one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=4745)|
| 1:19:08| that we can do a much better job at, you know, in the future, once we even get past the pandemic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=4748)|
| 1:19:15| So the great question, and yes, that's my concern too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=4755)|
| 1:19:19| that we make sure that all of our students have the access| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=4759)|
| 1:19:24| and the opportunities for new learning to be introduced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=4764)|
| 1:19:29| So, you know, great point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=4769)|
| 1:19:31| And that's our direction too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=4771)|
| 1:19:34| Ms. Pickler?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=4774)|
| 1:19:36| Mr. Brown, I've got some questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=4776)|
| 1:19:37| Oh, Ms. Brown, did you have a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=4777)|
| 1:19:38| Just one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=4778)|
| 1:19:39| Please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=4779)|
| 1:19:40| And thank you for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=4780)|
| 1:19:41| And just to build upon what she said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=4781)|
| 1:19:42| if we could at one of our subsequent meetings, superintendent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=4782)|
| 1:19:46| have whatever plan is in place to make sure our ELL students are serviced once we get to the one-to-one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=4786)|
| 1:19:54| I would really like to have that information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=4794)|
| 1:19:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=4796)|
| 1:19:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=4797)|
| 1:19:59| Ms. Pickler?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=4799)|
| 1:20:01| Just two questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=4801)|
| 1:20:02| Are there other options that the county is looking at for online access other than Zoom?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=4802)|
| 1:20:09| Other than what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=4809)|
| 1:20:10| Zoom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=4810)|
| 1:20:11| Other than using the Zoom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=4811)|
| 1:20:12| Oh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=4812)|
| 1:20:13| Are there other options?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=4813)|
| 1:20:15| There's Microsoft Team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=4815)|
| 1:20:17| I know that we use that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=4817)|
| 1:20:19| I think that's an option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=4819)|
| 1:20:21| I think it works probably a little better than Zoom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=4821)|
| 1:20:24| So Microsoft Team is, you know, is an option as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=4824)|
| 1:20:29| So we're trying to look at everything and see what's best, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=4829)|
| 1:20:32| and get back to resources, what we can afford and what works best.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=4832)|
| 1:20:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=4837)|
| 1:20:38| My question is, are you looking to have a normal start date for school at this point?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=4838)|
| 1:20:45| That would be my goal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=4845)|
| 1:20:48| That date is August 10th, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=4848)|
| 1:20:51| So that's what we're shooting for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=4851)|
| 1:20:57| So when July 15th, I think my recommendation to the board is due on July 15th, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=4857)|
| 1:21:04| But August 10th is what's on the calendar right now, and that has not been changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=4864)|
| 1:21:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=4869)|
| 1:21:12| Ms. Carr, did you have a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=4872)|
| 1:21:14| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=4874)|
| 1:21:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=4875)|
| 1:21:16| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=4876)|
| 1:21:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=4877)|
| 1:21:19| Thank you for being there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=4879)|
| 1:21:20| I would not want to be in your shoes right now, but I appreciate your answers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=4880)|
| 1:21:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=4884)|
| 1:21:25| I'm going to throw in my special ed question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=4885)|
| 1:21:28| There are many students who are in special education and not who can't learn online.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=4888)|
| 1:21:34| And I understand that, I mean, online is just not a preferred method.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=4894)|
| 1:21:39| There's lots of attention problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=4899)|
| 1:21:42| And the other issue is that many of our students already have medical issues, not just medical problems,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=4902)|
| 1:21:51| but the staff as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=4911)|
| 1:21:53| We're talking, like, children who need hand-over-hand assistance and more direct instruction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=4913)|
| 1:21:59| And I just think that I just wonder, like, what are the plans for those children to, one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=4919)|
| 1:22:09| have the health and safety issues in place day one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=4929)|
| 1:22:15| and be able to communicate very explicitly to parents what those health and safety issues are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=4935)|
| 1:22:20| not just for those students, but for all students and staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=4940)|
| 1:22:23| And two, I mean, what are the plans for our students with significant disabilities?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=4943)|
| 1:22:29| When we talk about equity, we also talk about students that are in the three to four percent of that population| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=4949)|
| 1:22:37| who are not learning online who we are obligated to educate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=4957)|
| 1:22:41| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=4961)|
| 1:22:42| And we're having those conversations, and maybe it would be good to get Jason Myers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=4962)|
| 1:22:47| Jason's over at our special education department, to come talk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=4967)|
| 1:22:51| But you're right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=4971)|
| 1:22:52| Again, when we talk about all children, I'm talking about all children and disabilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=4972)|
| 1:22:58| And there are going to be some cases where there's going to have to be that contact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=4978)|
| 1:23:03| because the technology is just not going to work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=4983)|
| 1:23:06| So how do we do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=4986)|
| 1:23:07| And we're having those conversations, and maybe we'll get Jason, Mr. Myers, to come and talk about that a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=4987)|
| 1:23:15| And our board, you know, our board, the three goals are increase student achievement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=4995)|
| 1:23:20| eliminate disparities, and build a positive culture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=5000)|
| 1:23:23| So, you know, that's what I get up every morning thinking about and think about all day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=5003)|
| 1:23:28| That's what our board's thinking about and our staff, our team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=5008)|
| 1:23:33| So when I say all children, I'm not talking about leaving out any child.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=5013)|
| 1:23:38| So I appreciate the comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=5018)|
| 1:23:44| I do have one question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=5024)|
| 1:23:45| Those are exactly, and just I think as I look at what we're charged with doing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=5025)|
| 1:23:51| raising those issues is precisely what we're asked to do to make sure that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=5031)|
| 1:23:57| every question gets answered before we have to make a decision, before the school board has to make a decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=5037)|
| 1:24:05| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=5045)|
| 1:24:06| So those are helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=5046)|
| 1:24:07| Somebody down here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=5047)|
| 1:24:08| I have a question about transportation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=5048)|
| 1:24:11| If on busing you have to keep the social distancing, and I realize, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=5051)|
| 1:24:15| when they said that the numbers are pretty even to what they have been in the past,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=5055)|
| 1:24:19| people who say they'll actually be using the buses, but if you have to, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=5059)|
| 1:24:23| I know my kid's school bus was always jam-packed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=5063)|
| 1:24:26| So is there a plan in place for getting kids to school?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=5066)|
| 1:24:33| Well, of course, the transportation, it's up to the parent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=5073)|
| 1:24:37| You know, we do provide transportation, but it's really, you know, up to the parent to get their child to school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=5077)|
| 1:24:42| So it might be a situation, and again, we're having those conversations too, but it might be a situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=5082)|
| 1:24:48| It's hard to have social distancing on a bus unless you just put a lot fewer children on that bus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=5088)|
| 1:24:55| So would it be a situation maybe with masks that there would be a requirement, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=5095)|
| 1:25:01| if you're going to ride the bus, you know, you're going to have to, and I'm not saying that's what it is today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=5101)|
| 1:25:06| So I know we have media here. I don't want to say tonight, well, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=5106)|
| 1:25:09| the superintendent says every child that rides the bus has got to have a mask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=5109)|
| 1:25:12| But those are some of the things we're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=5112)|
| 1:25:15| You know, if you're going to get on the bus, we can't practice the social distancing or physical distancing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=5115)|
| 1:25:20| then you're going to have to take these other precautions to keep others safe on that bus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=5120)|
| 1:25:27| So those are lots of good questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=5127)|
| 1:25:31| Y'all are having a lot of the same questions that I'm getting from a focus group, you know, people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=5131)|
| 1:25:37| So I appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=5137)|
| 1:25:41| Are there other questions, observations, comments based on what we've heard tonight?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=5141)|
| 1:25:48| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=5148)|
| 1:25:51| Dr. Eskew, can I say one more thing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=5151)|
| 1:25:53| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=5153)|
| 1:25:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=5154)|
| 1:25:55| Thank you to each one of you for being willing to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=5155)|
| 1:25:59| It's just heartwarming to me that the folks in our community will come out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=5159)|
| 1:26:05| and serve on a task force like this to help us to get ready for the opening of schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=5165)|
| 1:26:11| So I don't know how many opportunities I'll have to say thank you to you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=5171)|
| 1:26:14| but I'll take every one I get.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=5174)|
| 1:26:17| So thank you so much, and I look forward to being back with you, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=5177)|
| 1:26:21| Go get us some money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=5181)|
| 1:26:26| So Monday night we'll be meeting again, Monday evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=5186)|
| 1:26:31| The question, I think the charge that we've all got is to go back and climb into the data,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=5191)|
| 1:26:38| see if there are any obvious questions that need to be answered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=5198)|
| 1:26:44| If you have suggestions about somebody from the administration you'd like to have here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=5204)|
| 1:26:53| like I'm going to have some questions about, let me know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=5213)|
| 1:26:57| and I'll work with Ms. Kelly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=5217)|
| 1:27:00| and we will make sure that whomever we need to have here to answer those questions will be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=5220)|
| 1:27:06| The one thing I don't want is for us to not be able to ask questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=5226)|
| 1:27:10| because we didn't have the right administrator here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=5230)|
| 1:27:13| So if you know you're going to be asking about a specific area, please let me know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=5233)|
| 1:27:19| and Ms. Kelly and I will work together to make sure someone will be here who can answer the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=5239)|
| 1:27:26| No, and we really don't want to blindside anybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=5246)|
| 1:27:29| We want this to be as open as it can possibly be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=5249)|
| 1:27:35| Next week, or Monday, one of the things I will ask you to consider is what would you like for me to say?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=5255)|
| 1:27:44| We have someone from the school system who is taking notes tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=5264)|
| 1:27:47| and capturing all of the questions and comments that we're making.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=5267)|
| 1:27:51| After we answer all of our questions on Monday based on what we've seen in the data,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=5271)|
| 1:27:57| and our charge is to respond to the data, but since we've got a platform,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=5277)|
| 1:28:02| we need to ask whatever we have on our hearts because we are representing the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=5282)|
| 1:28:06| I would love for you to think about some key points that you would like me to make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=5286)|
| 1:28:11| when I go to the workshop to make sure that our concerns are all represented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=5291)|
| 1:28:15| So feel free to write those down and bring them up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=5295)|
| 1:28:20| and then anything you want me to say on our behalf, I can almost guarantee you I'll say it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=5300)|
| 1:28:27| So is there anything else for the good of the order tonight that you'd like to make sure we cover?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=5307)|
| 1:28:38| All right, we're adjourned until Monday. Thank you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200624-community-task-force?start=5318)|
