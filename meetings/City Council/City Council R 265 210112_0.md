| 0:07:09| So, as I've been starting for the last several times, as allowed by Governor Lee's executive orders in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, unless I hear objection, I'm going to rule that by acclamation, Council agrees that this meeting is being conducted electronically in order to protect the public health.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=429)|

| 0:07:34| We haven't seen each other in a meeting since we celebrated the coming of 2021.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=454)|

| 0:07:46| As I indicated at our December meeting, despite all the challenges of 2020, we managed as a city and as a governing body to get a lot of good things done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=466)|
| 0:07:57| So, thank you for your help and good ideas and collaboration in making our care move forward despite the challenges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=477)|
| 0:08:06| And I know we have opportunities and challenges ahead of us in 2021, and I'm looking forward to working together on this with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=486)|
| 0:08:14| A couple of staff announcements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=494)|
| 0:08:16| I'm really excited to welcome Kelly Drummond to the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=496)|
| 0:08:20| She started this past week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=500)|
| 0:08:22| Oh, there she is, Dr. Drummond, is our new Director of HR.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=502)|
| 0:08:28| So, it's the first HR department we've had as a city in decades.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=508)|
| 0:08:33| Dr. Drummond is a familiar face around our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=513)|
| 0:08:36| She's served with the Boys and Girls Club of the Tennessee Valley for more than 20 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=516)|
| 0:08:41| And I'm so excited that she's on board, and I know she'll be instrumental in helping employees and managers get the training, career development, recruitment assistance, and workplace support they need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=521)|
| 0:08:53| So, the newly established HR department is possible because of your vote last June.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=533)|
| 0:08:59| So, thank you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=539)|
| 0:09:00| I think it's going to be – there's a lot of work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=540)|
| 0:09:02| I know Dr. Drummond is already aware that there's a lot of work to be done in this transition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=542)|
| 0:09:07| And I just also want to thank all the people along the way who've been helping with this transition and helping Dr. Drummond get started on the right foot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=547)|
| 0:09:14| So, thank you to council for helping us start an HR department, and welcome to Kelly Drummond, who's leading it for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=554)|
| 0:09:22| Another exciting change is Kendra Brewer, who many of you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=562)|
| 0:09:28| I appointed her as the city's Director of Special Events.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=568)|
| 0:09:31| As you know, Judith retired at the end of November.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=571)|
| 0:09:35| And Kendra has been her deputy for many years and has worked for the city for more than 15 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=575)|
| 0:09:41| And now, this last year, she's played a formative role in establishing and developing – well, over the last 15 years, she's helped establish and develop several new city events and traditions, including the Christmas time celebration of lights and the festival on the 4th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=581)|
| 0:09:56| which is the city's largest annual event and features the city's largest fireworks display.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=596)|
| 0:10:01| So, Ms. Brewer has also been key this particular year in working with organizers throughout the pandemic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=601)|
| 0:10:08| And we all look forward to her leadership of this department as we eagerly await holding big events in Knoxville again as soon as it's safe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=608)|
| 0:10:15| So, welcome – not welcome exactly, but we're glad to have Kendra firmly on board leading that important department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=615)|
| 0:10:24| I don't know if she's on the call, but she can wave if she is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=624)|
| 0:10:28| It's hard to tell on Zoom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=628)|
| 0:10:32| Last – you had a workshop last week, and one of the subjects that came up was Title VI, which is a really important part of our city's equity efforts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=632)|
| 0:10:42| So, just as a follow-up, I wanted to make sure to those of you who weren't aware or to those members of the public who might not have been aware that we do have a very strong Title VI program led by Tasha Harris.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=642)|
| 0:10:55| And you all should have received – Tasha produced and published and shared with you all in November a copy of the 2020 Title VI report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=655)|
| 0:11:03| It's also available to all members of the public on the Title VI webpage for anyone who's interested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=663)|
| 0:11:09| And I invite members of council to reach out to Ms. Harris if you have any questions about the report or other work she does related to Title VI.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=669)|
| 0:11:16| She and Charles Lomax would welcome an opportunity to talk with you about the many ways that Community Empowerment is working alongside our internal – with our internal and external partners to promote equity and address disparities that exist in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=676)|
| 0:11:31| So, I'm really grateful for Tasha's work on that, and you guys can give her a call or email if you have any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=691)|
| 0:11:40| Another thing I wanted to mention, a report that I wanted to make sure you're aware of is the release of the draft sidewalk study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=700)|
| 0:11:48| Some of you will recall the series of public meetings held in 2019 before – you know, some of you were already on council, others were probably paying attention, but not from a council perspective yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=708)|
| 0:12:00| Numerous public meetings were held to gather feedback and hear ideas from residents about ways to make a safer and more comprehensive sidewalk network.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=720)|
| 0:12:08| Our residents and neighborhoods care about sidewalks a lot, as do I.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=728)|
| 0:12:12| Sidewalks are critical infrastructure and a major investment in our annual budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=732)|
| 0:12:16| The draft sidewalk study includes a comprehensive inventory of the existing sidewalk network and establishes a framework to inform sidewalk investment and help the city identify project priorities over the short and long term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=736)|
| 0:12:31| The engineering team would like a chance to present to council during a workshop, review the draft study in more detail with you if that's – if council wishes to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=751)|
| 0:12:39| It's a pretty thick, complex document with a lot of details and ideas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=759)|
| 0:12:45| And, you know, so if you all want to have a workshop to go into that in greater detail, the Department of Engineering is ready to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=765)|
| 0:12:52| Let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=772)|
| 0:12:56| In the meantime, you can review the draft report and be in touch with Director Harold Cannon for additional discussion on a one-on-one basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=776)|
| 0:13:04| You can find the report at KnoxvilleTN.gov forward slash sidewalks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=784)|
| 0:13:10| And last, I just wanted to – Councilman Roberto alluded to this in the invocation, but last week, you know, we all witnessed some very upsetting events that happened in our nation's capital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=790)|
| 0:13:21| And I just want to say I'm very grateful for the law enforcement officers who protected our members of Congress and lament the tragic loss of life that occurred.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=801)|
| 0:13:31| I also want to urge the people of our community right here in the city of Knoxville to look out for each other during these tumultuous times and work towards peaceful resolutions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=811)|
| 0:13:42| As we are about to celebrate our annual recognition of the great work of Martin Luther King, I know that we have challenges with conflict.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=822)|
| 0:13:52| But I know that he has taught us, and as have many other people who followed in his footsteps, that there are ways to pursue justice and be peaceful at the same time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=832)|
| 0:14:02| So that's what I'm encouraging all of us to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=842)|
| 0:14:06| That concludes my mayor's report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=846)|
| 0:14:09| And are there any reports of councilmembers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=849)|
| 0:14:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=855)|
| 0:14:17| Councilmember Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=857)|
| 0:14:19| I just wanted to also on January 20th, we've got an inauguration, but also the chamber as part of its path to prosperity and supporting local businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=859)|
| 0:14:29| And as it relates to equities, launching 100 Knoxville kickoff event is January 20th at 9 a.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=869)|
| 0:14:37| 100 Knoxville is a program to support Black-owned businesses in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=877)|
| 0:14:43| And so it's the events online and free to the public, 9 a.m. on the 20th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=883)|
| 0:14:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=890)|
| 0:14:52| Thank you, Councilmember Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=892)|
| 0:14:54| Any other announcements?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=894)|
| 0:15:00| There are, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=900)|
| 0:15:02| Oh, Councilmember Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=902)|
| 0:15:04| Yeah, I'd just like to, I believe this is something I talked to our attorney, Rob Frost, with, as well as with the mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=904)|
| 0:15:15| I think there was a bit of confusion in our last meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=915)|
| 0:15:19| We actually have rules in the city ordinances for how we conduct our business and discuss agenda items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=919)|
| 0:15:29| And I think what's a little bit challenging for us is we haven't had a retreat with this new council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=929)|
| 0:15:39| We haven't been able to be with each other for a long time, and we haven't been able to hold our retreats and unfortunately had to be canceled multiple times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=939)|
| 0:15:49| But I'd like to say how much I'd like for us to be able to do that in some manner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=949)|
| 0:15:57| Because at the last council meeting, we had, I think the confusion is that many of us and even myself, we haven't had to necessarily invoke our rules about order of operations for being able to speak and how we take turns and how much time we get allotted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=957)|
| 0:16:17| And that led to some frustration and I think some misunderstanding with the public in terms of following Robert's rules of order and calling the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=977)|
| 0:16:26| And so I hope that we can review that in a workshop in the future and maybe be able to pass the torch and have our questions answered and be able to discuss things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=986)|
| 0:16:40| But in Section 7.5-79, Rule 18, Order of Debate, we have actual rules about what order that we speak in, in terms of whose names are on things and how long we get to speak and how long there is for rebuttal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=1000)|
| 0:17:00| And I think we've talked about reviewing public forum, but I think this is something that we need to touch on so we don't end up in the situation we ended up at the last meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=1020)|
| 0:17:11| Thank you, Council Member Ryder. Just for council's knowledge, I have reviewed this rule as your presiding officer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=1031)|
| 0:17:23| I think I read it during the first month of my administration, but I reviewed it just in this interim period and will certainly do my best to make sure to preside in a way that is consistent with your rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=1043)|
| 0:17:37| So thanks for bringing that up, Council Member Ryder. And if you guys have any particular questions or want review before you can have a retreat, I know your attorney, Frost, can walk you through the particularities of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=1057)|
| 0:17:52| Thank you. Council Member Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=1072)|
| 0:18:11| I'm going to be a part of a discussion on January 18th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=1091)|
| 0:18:39| That's being hosted, I believe, by multiple organizations, but United Campus Workers is one of the lead groups.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=1119)|
| 0:18:48| And I'm just one of very many speakers, but it's an important topic about the effects of austerity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=1128)|
| 0:18:58| And I hope that folks will join us as we're starting a new year. And I imagine, you know, more and more discussions about the upcoming city budget will be taking place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=1138)|
| 0:19:12| And there's a lot on the community's mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=1152)|
| 0:19:15| So I expect a good discussion that day. And then just in response, I really do not think any of the concerns that I heard from the community and my frustration certainly was not around a lack of understanding of rules, but a lack of consistency with how our meetings have been run,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=1155)|
| 0:19:38| especially on a very important topic that would not receive a second opportunity for discussion. I didn't understand why, you know, I felt my voice was silenced in that moment. I still have a lot of questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=1178)|
| 0:19:54| And honestly, actually, I just have to say really quickly, at our last meeting, I did note that it was my preference that we had a workshop on the item before it was brought to a vote because there were many questions to explore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=1194)|
| 0:20:16| Since making that statement, county commissioners have suggested that a joint workshop based on my suggestion might be a good idea going forward. I just want to go on record to clarify that my request of a workshop was before we would have the vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=1216)|
| 0:20:36| Moving forward, I do not think that is a topic of top priority for us to be discussing as a joint government. I believe, you know, we should be discussing how we continue jointly to respond and then ultimately recover from the current pandemic. So I just wanted to go on the record as saying that I'm not calling for a workshop. The time has passed on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=1236)|
| 0:21:00| Okay. Thank you, Councilmember Parker. Just to direct Councilmembers and anyone who may be watching who's interested in the Martin Luther King Day events, you can read about and find the details about all the events that are planned at MLKKnoxville.com. And the very first event is tomorrow at noon. It's an interfaith prayer service, and it's being held virtually. So please tune in if you have time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=1260)|

| 0:33:38| Any questions or discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=2018)|
| 0:33:39| Councilmember Parker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=2019)|
| 0:33:40| I had a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=2020)|
| 0:33:41| Just, you know, considering the limitations on engaging the community during the pandemic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=2021)|
| 0:33:51| what will be the plan for implementing this master planning process?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=2031)|
| 0:33:58| Mr. Bentley?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=2038)|
| 0:34:00| Yeah, that's a wonderful question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=2040)|
| 0:34:04| Thank you, Councilwoman Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=2044)|
| 0:34:05| So, we actually, within our budget, we have allotted tablets, an amount of money to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=2045)|
| 0:34:13| able to either purchase tablets or at least rent tablets to provide to residents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=2053)|
| 0:34:18| Throughout these processes, HUD and our organization view that resident stakeholder as the most| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=2058)|
| 0:34:25| important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=2065)|
| 0:34:26| So, there's going to be that sort of virtual access, and then also coupled with drop-bys| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=2066)|
| 0:34:32| at outdoor locations that are socially distanced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=2072)|
| 0:34:35| So, those are the two most successful ways that we've seen these kind of things done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=2075)|
| 0:34:39| in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=2079)|
| 0:34:41| It's not perfect, but that's, I think, we can keep the community safe while also getting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=2081)|
| 0:34:46| good feedback and input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=2086)|
| 0:34:48| And can you remind me of what the timeline is for that input from the community?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=2088)|
| 0:34:54| Yeah, so this will be about a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=2094)|
| 0:34:57| So, this, you know, timelines do change with the events that happen on the ground, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=2097)|
| 0:35:03| it'll be about a year process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=2103)|
| 0:35:04| So, we would hope to get this underway in the next month or so, and it would run through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=2104)|
| 0:35:09| the end of 2021.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=2109)|
| 0:35:12| That's strange to say, but yeah, the end of 2021.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=2112)|
| 0:35:15| I would say that's my only major concern with starting this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=2115)|
| 0:35:21| You know, definitely don't want to delay improvements to the community, but we want to make sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=2121)|
| 0:35:28| that those communities are well-informed by the residents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=2128)|
| 0:35:33| And so, that will be my only concern and hope that there's some flexibility to, as you said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=2133)|
| 0:35:41| timelines and to make sure that input is prioritized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=2141)|
| 0:35:45| Yes, absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=2145)|
| 0:35:46| That was the only question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=2146)|
| 0:35:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=2148)|

| 0:35:51| And I'll just say to KCDC folks, if you need extra help from our Office of Neighborhoods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=2151)|
| 0:35:57| or Community Empowerment team, you know, they're here to assist in that effort as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=2157)|
| 0:36:02| I also just wanted to mention to council members that this brings the city's investment in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=2162)|
| 0:36:08| affordable housing during this fiscal year to $6.4 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=2168)|
| 0:36:13| And we expect that total to get up to $11 million in the coming weeks and months as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=2173)|
| 0:36:18| the city brings to council additional projects seeking support from the Affordable Rental| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=2178)|
| 0:36:22| Development Fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=2182)|
| 0:36:23| So, this investment is significant, and it's reflective of my and our continued commitment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=2183)|
| 0:36:29| to invest in projects that support healthy and connected neighborhoods and preserve affordable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=2189)|
| 0:36:33| options even as we welcome new growth and investment in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=2193)|
| 0:36:39| Any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=2199)|
| 0:36:40| Yep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=2200)|
| 0:36:41| Council Member Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=2201)|
| 0:36:42| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=2202)|
| 0:36:43| I just wanted to ask Mr. Bentley, would this include the area that's vacant from the previous| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=2203)|
| 0:36:48| housing that was demolished?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=2208)|
| 0:36:50| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=2210)|
| 0:36:51| So, the site is about 80 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=2211)|
| 0:36:54| It would include that vacant land that is currently underutilized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=2214)|
| 0:36:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=2219)|
| 0:37:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=2220)|
| 0:37:04| Any further questions or comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=2224)|
| 0:37:08| I have just a question that I think you've asked and answered this, but does this include| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=2228)|
| 0:37:13| the rural high school property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=2233)|
| 0:37:15| I know...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=2235)|
| 0:37:16| No, I'll just stop with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=2236)|
| 0:37:19| So, at the current point, that is still owned by the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=2239)|
| 0:37:24| And so, we don't assume that that will be part of our specific planning in terms of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=2244)|
| 0:37:29| deciding a future use for that site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=2249)|
| 0:37:31| But it is in the neighborhood, so obviously, we have to consider our housing site as well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=2251)|
| 0:37:37| as all of the connections in the surrounding areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=2257)|
| 0:37:40| And there may be potential at some point to look at that site for redevelopment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=2260)|
| 0:37:43| But right now, we don't have a plan for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=2263)|
| 0:37:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=2269)|
| 0:37:50| Any other questions or comments from Council?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=2270)|

| 0:38:46| Motion made to approve by Council Member Fugate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=2326)|
| 0:38:50| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=2330)|
| 0:38:51| Seconded by Council Member Testerman and Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=2331)|
| 0:38:55| I think Testerman said it first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=2335)|
| 0:38:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=2339)|
| 0:39:00| So, this contract rounds out over $3 million that we have allocated to date toward helping| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=2340)|
| 0:39:06| local residents and partners address critical housing needs that have been exacerbated by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=2346)|
| 0:39:10| the COVID-19 pandemic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=2350)|
| 0:39:11| So, I want to thank the Knoxville Area Urban League, as well as all the other subgrantees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=2351)|
| 0:39:16| who have stepped up to administer federal funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=2356)|
| 0:39:19| As the pandemic continues to impact our community, the staff and Housing and Neighborhood Development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=2359)|
| 0:39:23| are working hard to get these and additional funds out the door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=2363)|
| 0:39:27| And thank you to that team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=2367)|
| 0:39:28| Becky Wade is here to address any questions that Council may have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=2368)|
| 0:39:34| Council Member Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=2374)|
| 0:39:35| I had some questions that I sent to both Becky and Linda and the Urban League around this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=2375)|
| 0:39:47| because I was concerned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=2387)|
| 0:39:48| There's language in our packet, you know, that states that project priorities will be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=2388)|
| 0:39:54| for this funding will be the homeless and folks receiving homelessness services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=2394)|
| 0:40:02| But when I look through the funding that we've approved, it seems, you know, the $3 million,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=2402)|
| 0:40:09| it seems like the majority is going towards prevention of homelessness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=2409)|
| 0:40:15| And these are all important things for us to fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=2415)|
| 0:40:19| What I would encourage us to do as a city is to commit additional local funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=2419)|
| 0:40:25| The federal funds are not going to be enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=2425)|
| 0:40:28| And I'm sure the, you know, the rest of you are also hearing reports of individuals freezing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=2428)|
| 0:40:35| to death on our streets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=2435)|
| 0:40:38| This is the time of year last month when homeless service agencies, you know, do a commemoration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=2438)|
| 0:40:45| to the folks who've passed away in our community due to lack of access to shelter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=2445)|
| 0:40:52| And so, I just want us to do more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=2452)|
| 0:40:57| If we can't do it with these federal funds, then we've got to allocate more from our local| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=2457)|
| 0:41:02| funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=2462)|
| 0:41:03| In our recent meeting, the Audit Committee meeting, we saw a surplus of funds that was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=2463)|
| 0:41:09| not anticipated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=2469)|
| 0:41:10| So, that's, you know, there's not much I can do as a member of City Council, but call on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=2470)|
| 0:41:15| the administration, you know, to bring more projects committing local funding to supporting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=2475)|
| 0:41:23| those who are homeless, currently homeless and sleeping in these elements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=2483)|
| 0:41:30| VICE CHAIR TERRELL.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=2490)|
| 0:41:32| Thank you, Council Member Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=2492)|
| 0:41:33| Any, did you have a particular question for Becky Wade or did any council members want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=2493)|
| 0:41:40| to ask?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=2500)|
| 0:41:41| Becky Wade's on the call, and so is Phyllis Nichols from the Urban League.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=2501)|
| 0:41:43| MS.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=2503)|
| 0:41:44| NICHOLS.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=2504)|
| 0:41:45| The only question I didn't get answered was a better understanding of the work that the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=2505)|
| 0:41:48| Urban League does with households earning under $25,000 that would meet that very low-income| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=2508)|
| 0:41:55| HUD standard and at-risk for homelessness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=2515)|
| 0:41:58| MS.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=2518)|
| 0:41:59| NICHOLS.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=2519)|
| 0:42:00| Hi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=2520)|
| 0:42:01| This is Phyllis Nichols.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=2521)|
| 0:42:04| And the, and thank you for the question, Council Member Parker, because one of the things that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=2524)|
| 0:42:11| I want the community, as well as our funding partners, to understand the work that we are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=2531)|
| 0:42:18| doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=2538)|
| 0:42:19| The Emergency Solutions Grant has several initiatives that are required for federal funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=2539)|
| 0:42:30| And one of the, what our initiative is, or our focus under this federal funding, is to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=2550)|
| 0:42:38| make sure that low-income residents who are facing eviction or are having to be in multiple,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=2558)|
| 0:42:52| crowded households, that we can use this fund to address those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=2572)|
| 0:42:59| I think that your question, and I appreciate your intent on looking at the currently homeless| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=2579)|
| 0:43:10| is not the part that we are addressing under this particular initiative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=2590)|
| 0:43:16| The part that the Urban League is serving as a HUD-certified housing counseling, meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=2596)|
| 0:43:22| those requirements of HUD, to try to keep people from being evicted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=2602)|
| 0:43:27| And if those things happen, then we will help to find affordable housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=2607)|
| 0:43:33| The resources help to pay for rent and those kinds of assistance that people are, are needed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=2613)|
| 0:43:41| because they've lost their jobs doing COVID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=2621)|
| 0:43:45| Let me also add that a value add for the Urban League is while we're helping people with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=2625)|
| 0:43:52| their housing, we also help with their, with their employment needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=2632)|
| 0:43:57| You asked a specific question about what the Urban League does for the low, the low,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=2637)|
| 0:44:09| the very low-income.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=2649)|
| 0:44:10| I have also asked that our HUD-certified counselor, Felix Harris, be on the call so that he can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=2650)|
| 0:44:18| answer your concerns about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=2658)|
| 0:44:21| So for those who have a low income, we work, we have always worked with them from the standpoint| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=2661)|
| 0:44:31| of housing, from the standpoint of, because all low income, they may own a home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=2671)|
| 0:44:37| So we do foreclosure prevention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=2677)|
| 0:44:39| We work from, from the standpoint of financial education and financial coaching.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=2679)|
| 0:44:46| So our main thing is we want to make sure that we prevent homelessness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=2686)|
| 0:44:50| So like I said, we do foreclosure counseling, we do financial education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=2690)|
| 0:44:54| Yeah, we do those other things also that you had mentioned, but we, we are about, we work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=2694)|
| 0:45:00| with all income levels and we always have, and especially right now due to COVID, basically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=2700)|
| 0:45:07| most of our people are very low income, but they're needing rental assistance, utility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=2707)|
| 0:45:12| assistance, and all other types of assistance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=2712)|
| 0:45:16| Thank you for the clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=2716)|
| 0:45:20| I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=2720)|
| 0:45:21| Thank you, Ms. Nichols and Mr. Harris.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=2721)|
| 0:45:26| Council members, I just wanted to mention just to add a little clarity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=2726)|
| 0:45:31| First, if you all wanted to get a more thorough briefing with details on homeless issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=2731)|
| 0:45:37| I invite you, we'd be happy to plan with you all at your request at workshop or in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=2737)|
| 0:45:45| times past council has had meetings with various departments in the five o'clock hour before| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=2745)|
| 0:45:49| the six o'clock council meeting starts, we could do that on a more informal basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=2749)|
| 0:45:56| If you ask, we'll, we'll make it happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=2756)|
| 0:45:58| So that's, just wanted to mention that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=2758)|
| 0:46:01| Also, I just wanted to make sure you all knew that first, you know, KPD does give plenty| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=2761)|
| 0:46:08| of notice, 72 hours, if there's any complaints about tent encampments, that's when KPD responds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=2768)|
| 0:46:16| they do so at first with verbal messaging and connecting people to services and trying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=2776)|
| 0:46:22| to get people into housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=2782)|
| 0:46:25| And now of course we have the co-response pilot where they have access to a social worker| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=2785)|
| 0:46:30| to go on those visits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=2790)|
| 0:46:32| And we have, thanks to the funding that you have approved, VMC, one of our partners has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=2792)|
| 0:46:38| now I think six or more street outreach workers who are doing this work in partnership and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=2798)|
| 0:46:45| collaboration with other providers and with our police officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=2805)|
| 0:46:49| So our police are not raiding anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=2809)|
| 0:46:51| There's no surprises.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=2811)|
| 0:46:52| There's no destruction of property or slashing of tents or anything like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=2812)|
| 0:46:58| Also, they do try to direct people, it is cold weather and tents are not going to provide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=2818)|
| 0:47:02| enough protection during these very cold times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=2822)|
| 0:47:05| So I wanted to let you know that our shelter, our emergency shelters do have capacity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=2825)|
| 0:47:09| The most recent update from CARM is that they're 73% full in the men's shelter and 58% in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=2829)|
| 0:47:16| women's shelter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=2836)|
| 0:47:17| That was as of Sunday night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=2837)|
| 0:47:19| The foyer has eight beds available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=2839)|
| 0:47:22| There's a place that serves for youth under 18 that has four beds available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=2842)|
| 0:47:28| The health department is working to provide housing for homeless, houseless individuals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=2848)|
| 0:47:34| who need to be in quarantine, either at the guest house or if that is full, then they're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=2854)|
| 0:47:39| putting them up in other accommodations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=2859)|
| 0:47:42| Salvation Army is 50% capacity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=2862)|
| 0:47:45| So there's room for people off the streets and in safe, heated places.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=2865)|
| 0:47:50| And all of these partners have made every effort to make things safer and more spaced| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=2870)|
| 0:47:57| out and ventilated due to COVID, just like we all have in our work and other environments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=2877)|
| 0:48:03| So anyhow, I just wanted to make sure that you were aware of those, that there are places| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=2883)|
| 0:48:09| for the unhoused people to go to get out of the elements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=2889)|
| 0:48:12| It's not perfect and we need to keep working on affordable housing and issues around mental| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=2892)|
| 0:48:17| health and substance misuse, but there are places for people to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=2897)|
| 0:48:23| So that's the main things I wanted to mention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=2903)|
| 0:48:28| And any other questions for Director Wade or the Urban League folks?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=2908)|
| 0:48:36| Okay, seeing none, please conduct a roll call vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=2916)|

| 0:49:07| And Councilman Thomas?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=2947)|
| 0:49:11| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=2951)|

| 0:49:57| Motion to approve by Councilmember Thomas, seconded by Councilmember Singh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=2997)|
| 0:50:01| Any questions or discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=3001)|
| 0:50:02| Councilmember Thomas?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=3002)|
| 0:50:03| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=3003)|
| 0:50:04| I had a question, possibly for Ms. Wade or possibly for someone in codes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=3004)|
| 0:50:12| I see where this particular parcel is subject to the infill housing design guidelines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=3012)|
| 0:50:18| And of course, we all want this to go smoothly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=3018)|
| 0:50:21| And I just wanted to ask what would be the process to monitor the construction of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=3021)|
| 0:50:28| house and also to be able to provide assistance to Habitat to make sure that these guidelines| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=3028)|
| 0:50:37| were followed and the construction proceeded as it should?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=3037)|
| 0:50:43| Who is able to answer his questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=3043)|
| 0:50:53| Ms. Wade, are you on the call still?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=3053)|
| 0:50:59| I am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=3059)|
| 0:51:02| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=3062)|
| 0:51:03| This is about the Habitat for Humanity property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=3063)|
| 0:51:07| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=3067)|
| 0:51:08| Maybe this is a question more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=3068)|
| 0:51:09| Yeah, could you speak to Councilmember Thomas's questions or maybe if you could repeat them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=3069)|
| 0:51:15| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=3075)|
| 0:51:16| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=3076)|
| 0:51:17| Mayor, I could jump in as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=3077)|
| 0:51:18| This is David Braccio.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=3078)|
| 0:51:21| So I think obviously the compliance requirements when Habitat moves forward, building inspection,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=3081)|
| 0:51:29| Peter Ahrens and the team in building inspections will work with them along with Knox Planning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=3089)|
| 0:51:36| The Homemakers Program, and Ms. Wade can talk more about this, that program as well, there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=3096)|
| 0:51:40| a connection with community development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=3100)|
| 0:51:42| So the compliance will happen through building inspections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=3102)|
| 0:51:48| But again, Ms. Wade and her team want to make sure that these properties that go through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=3108)|
| 0:51:52| Homemakers meet the guise of that program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=3112)|
| 0:51:56| And I believe there is a clawback provision if that doesn't happen, correct, Ms. Wade?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=3116)|
| 0:52:01| Yes, that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=3121)|
| 0:52:02| Becky Wade, Director of Housing and Neighborhood Development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=3122)|
| 0:52:06| There is a clawback provision if properties are not developed as they are intended to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=3126)|
| 0:52:14| that the city can take the property back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=3134)|
| 0:52:17| But this property is in the Lonsdale redevelopment area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=3137)|
| 0:52:20| It's in the infill overlay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=3140)|
| 0:52:22| So there is a committee that reviews the design to make sure that the design of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=3142)|
| 0:52:28| house does fit with the surrounding architecture of the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=3148)|
| 0:52:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=3152)|
| 0:52:33| Yeah, I just wanted to make sure, obviously, we don't want to have to take this property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=3153)|
| 0:52:39| back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=3159)|
| 0:52:40| It could be working with the Homemakers Program and Habitat, there's an opportunity there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=3160)|
| 0:52:44| for someone to get housing, of course, which doesn't have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=3164)|
| 0:52:47| But I would just like to see that it's monitored as it goes forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=3167)|
| 0:52:53| And also that Habitat has offered whatever assistance that they may have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=3173)|
| 0:52:57| We want this project to be a success without any hiccups.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=3177)|
| 0:53:01| And so that's why I'm putting it to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=3181)|
| 0:53:04| Thank you, yes, we want successful projects as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=3184)|
| 0:53:10| Okay, thank you, Council Member Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=3190)|
| 0:53:13| Council Member Putnam.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=3193)|
| 0:53:14| Did I read in the materials that this is the first time Habitat for Humanity has applied| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=3194)|
| 0:53:20| to Homemakers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=3200)|

| 0:53:28| Okay, that's all I know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=3208)|
| 0:53:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=3210)|
| 0:53:31| Okay, any other questions or comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=3211)|
| 0:53:34| Mayor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=3214)|
| 0:53:35| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=3215)|
| 0:53:36| I wasn't sure if you could hear me or not, but this is Kathy Ellis with the Community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=3216)|
| 0:53:41| Development Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=3221)|
| 0:53:43| And I administer the Homemakers Program for that department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=3223)|
| 0:53:47| So I just wanted to touch a little bit on Mr. Thomas's question as far as infill goes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=3227)|
| 0:53:55| Habitat has already gone through the infill process through the Planning Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=3235)|
| 0:54:02| They went through that process in December.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=3242)|
| 0:54:06| Because we do not transfer any property until we make sure that it meets the eligibility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=3246)|
| 0:54:14| for planning or any infill guidelines, and that they have all of their funding together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=3254)|
| 0:54:21| in order to make the build successful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=3261)|
| 0:54:24| So with the Homemakers Program, we had the property ready to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=3264)|
| 0:54:32| And but they were also aware that it would not move forward until they got a certificate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=3272)|
| 0:54:38| of appropriateness from the infill department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=3278)|
| 0:54:42| And I think Bill Terry is on the call as well with Habitat if there were any specific questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=3282)|
| 0:54:50| on this particular property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=3290)|
| 0:54:53| It is a property that is going to be conveyed to them in addition to a lot right next door,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=3293)|
| 0:55:03| which is actually in the redevelopment area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=3303)|
| 0:55:09| This particular one is a tax sale parcel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=3309)|
| 0:55:12| So it's in the city's name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=3312)|
| 0:55:14| All properties in redevelopment areas that are in redevelopment areas are actually in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=3314)|
| 0:55:20| KCDC's name, and they are conveyed by their board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=3320)|
| 0:55:24| Anything in the city's name is conveyed by the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=3324)|
| 0:55:27| So I make sure that all of these applicants have everything they need in order to get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=3327)|
| 0:55:34| through the process, and I follow them closely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=3334)|
| 0:55:39| They have to start construction within 180 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=3339)|
| 0:55:41| It has to be completed within one year of transfer of the deed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=3341)|
| 0:55:46| That's when the time starts clicking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=3346)|
| 0:55:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=3347)|

| 1:00:04| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=3604)|
| 1:00:05| Just very briefly on behalf of the Roseberry City neighborhood, that's a neighborhood that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=3605)|
| 1:00:13| is historic, but it had kind of lost its identity somewhat over the years, and just a small| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=3613)|
| 1:00:18| amount of money here makes a big difference in that neighborhood trying to reclaim itself| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=3618)|
| 1:00:24| and its history and identity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=3624)|
| 1:00:26| So it's very much appreciated, even though we deal often in larger amounts of money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=3626)|
| 1:00:33| just this small amount really makes a difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=3633)|
| 1:00:35| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=3635)|
| 1:00:38| Thank you, Councilmember Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=3638)|
| 1:00:39| Councilmember Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=3639)|
| 1:00:40| I have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=3640)|
| 1:00:43| It was the bus shelter project for Vestal, is that just a, is that a bus shelter?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=3643)|
| 1:00:52| Who knows?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=3652)|
| 1:00:54| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=3654)|
| 1:00:55| Yes, that is a, they're trying to work with the Sustainable Futures Center to have a bus| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=3655)|
| 1:01:04| shelter there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=3664)|
| 1:01:05| Part of the reason being, there's a lot of individuals that catch the bus there, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=3665)|
| 1:01:14| they've been out in the rain and the weather, and so the two are working together for a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=3674)|
| 1:01:18| bus shelter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=3678)|
| 1:01:19| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=3679)|
| 1:01:20| I just thought it was, you know, it was unfortunate that they weren't able to do something like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=3680)|
| 1:01:25| fun.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=3685)|
| 1:01:26| You know, it's like the other communities got to, you know, have something that's a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=3686)|
| 1:01:32| really community-building activity, and it seemed like we, as the city, could have another| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=3692)|
| 1:01:38| fund that would support the bus shelters, and then they wouldn't have to use their neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=3698)|
| 1:01:42| grant for a bus shelter, but we would cover that expense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=3702)|
| 1:01:46| Is this not something that the city, an expense the city generally covers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=3706)|
| 1:01:52| It's new for the city to do this, normally it would be CAT that would provide bus shelter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=3712)|
| 1:02:00| funding, but there have been a couple of neighborhoods, this is the second one, Vestal's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=3720)|
| 1:02:06| the second one who's asked for that, and it's definitely something that they wanted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=3726)|
| 1:02:13| So we definitely saw the need and are happy with the committee's approval of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=3733)|
| 1:02:20| So we would want to, part of, I think, if I'm not mistaken, I need to go back and reread| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=3740)|
| 1:02:27| the application, but part of what we do in our grant program is we want them to work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=3747)|
| 1:02:35| on community engagement, and so I think part of what they'll do is they'll do a celebration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=3755)|
| 1:02:41| to do a ribbon-cutting with it, so they will get some fun with their event, but I do understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=3761)|
| 1:02:49| what you're saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=3769)|
| 1:02:50| This is Erin Gale, if I can jump in very quickly just to also clarify that this is a bus shelter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=3770)|
| 1:02:56| that, again, was proposed by Sustainable Future to be located on their private property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=3776)|
| 1:03:02| So I think that's another important distinction in drawing a line between bus shelters that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=3782)|
| 1:03:07| are located in public right-of-way versus this proposal, which is located on the private| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=3787)|
| 1:03:11| property of Sustainable Futures and was their request to us, which I think is a great one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=3791)|
| 1:03:16| Well, but they're fulfilling a need because there are outreach workers located at Sustainable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=3796)|
| 1:03:22| Futures that our homeless community members are accessing, and I've gotten calls from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=3802)|
| 1:03:28| homeless folks hiding in the ditch around Sustainable Futures because they were afraid| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=3808)|
| 1:03:34| to be harassed, afraid to be arrested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=3814)|
| 1:03:37| There was only private land for them to stand on, so it makes sense, but this is not a Sustainable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=3817)|
| 1:03:45| Futures issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=3825)|
| 1:03:47| This is a city issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=3827)|
| 1:03:48| That's the only issue I wanted to raise up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=3828)|
| 1:03:50| Of course, I support these neighborhood grants, but I also think this is not the neighborhood's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=3830)|
| 1:03:56| issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=3836)|
| 1:03:57| This is something we as a city should be paying for out of another budget or another long| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=3837)|

| 1:06:06| Any questions or comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=3966)|
| 1:06:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=3967)|
| 1:06:08| Council Member Singh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=3968)|
| 1:06:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=3969)|
| 1:06:10| Good evening, Mr. Ryerson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=3970)|
| 1:06:11| You and I had had a conversation earlier today that I know that the United Way and Urban League| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=3971)|
| 1:06:23| serves men and women, but bringing to the table the Family Justice Center, since women| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=3983)|
| 1:06:31| so often, so many women can get stuck in relationships because they have no financial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=3991)|
| 1:06:37| way out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=3997)|
| 1:06:38| So, I'm excited to hear that you're also inviting them to the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=3998)|
| 1:06:42| Yeah, absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=4002)|
| 1:06:44| Thank you, Council Member Singh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=4004)|
| 1:06:47| You know, as the Mayor mentioned, this is a planning grant, and initially, we just needed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=4007)|
| 1:06:53| a few letters of support for the application, for the purpose of the application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=4013)|
| 1:06:58| But in the materials, the goal would be to create an implementation proposal, which ultimately| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=4018)|
| 1:07:04| can lead to an additional grant for implementation of Financial Empowerment Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=4024)|
| 1:07:08| And there's actually a requirement to identify and secure a minimum of eight programmatic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=4028)|
| 1:07:12| partnerships.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=4032)|
| 1:07:14| And we'd probably look beyond that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=4034)|
| 1:07:16| And I think the organization you're talking about and the community it would serve is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=4036)|
| 1:07:21| ideal for this type of work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=4041)|
| 1:07:23| And so, while the Urban League is kind of a foundational partner, they do this work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=4043)|
| 1:07:28| every day, all the time, this could be a potential expansion and serve more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=4048)|
| 1:07:33| So, absolutely, our hope is that we receive the grant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=4053)|
| 1:07:38| And once we receive the grant, we can start the planning process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=4058)|
| 1:07:41| And that's when I think we'll really recruit and pursue a much broader partnership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=4061)|
| 1:07:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=4067)|
| 1:07:49| Thank you, Mr. Ryerson, Council Member Fugate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=4069)|
| 1:07:56| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=4076)|
| 1:07:57| So, I understand that this is just a planning grant, but I talked to Dr. Lomax this afternoon| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=4077)|
| 1:08:05| a little bit about the city's role in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=4085)|
| 1:08:11| In the, the city is the fiduciary, and is responsible for making sure that all the funds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=4091)|
| 1:08:16| get appropriated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=4096)|
| 1:08:19| In this planning grant, at some point, someone's going to have to own the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=4099)|
| 1:08:27| And so, yes, you can have collaborators, but someone has to be responsible for the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=4107)|
| 1:08:35| And I understand from Mr. Lomax that the United Way brought this opportunity to us because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=4115)|
| 1:08:41| the United Way in Nashville does it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=4121)|
| 1:08:43| Is the intent that this will be a United Way program that will, or will it be, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=4123)|
| 1:08:51| I know we've got to figure that out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=4131)|
| 1:08:52| I'm just asking, there must be some kind of idea about how that might look with partners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=4132)|
| 1:08:59| at the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=4139)|
| 1:09:00| Yeah, that's a great question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=4140)|
| 1:09:02| Thank you, Council Member.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=4142)|
| 1:09:03| But, you know, it's probably premature, as you're alluding to, in the planning grant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=4143)|
| 1:09:08| process to evaluate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=4148)|
| 1:09:10| That model works in Nashville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=4150)|
| 1:09:14| And they have really been strong advocates for here, for us here in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=4154)|
| 1:09:18| When I say here in Knoxville, I mean the community of Knoxville, not the United Way in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=4158)|
| 1:09:23| We could certainly play that role.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=4163)|
| 1:09:26| It's also possible that wouldn't be necessary, or someone else would play that role.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=4166)|
| 1:09:31| To be honest with you, I'd love to see this happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=4171)|
| 1:09:34| I think it's exciting what the potential is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=4174)|
| 1:09:37| I think United Way, our goal is to play whatever role best suits the successful implementation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=4177)|
| 1:09:45| of this program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=4185)|
| 1:09:46| So, the answer would be, yes, we'd be willing and able, but I think the planning process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=4186)|
| 1:09:50| could sort that out, and it might work better here in a different model, and we'd be open| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=4190)|
| 1:09:56| to that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=4196)|
| 1:09:57| Well, I mean, I'll just say, I mean, I absolutely support this initiative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=4197)|
| 1:10:02| I mean, as a former finance professional myself, the need for folks to have financial advice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=4202)|
| 1:10:10| and help beyond just how to repair bad credit so that you can own a home, which is primarily| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=4210)|
| 1:10:18| what we offer in our community on the path to home ownership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=4218)|
| 1:10:23| But I see this as a way to go into wealth building and savings and actually moving people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=4223)|
| 1:10:30| up levels of the rung of financial prosperity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=4230)|
| 1:10:38| So, I think that that's a nice layer to add into the community above and beyond just how| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=4238)|
| 1:10:46| do I buy my house?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=4246)|
| 1:10:50| Then what do I do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=4250)|
| 1:10:51| Yes, absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=4251)|
| 1:10:52| So, I think it's really needed, and I don't know, but it sounds a little like, I told| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=4252)|
| 1:10:59| Mr. Lomax, that sounds a little like SCORE, how they have retired business executives| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=4259)|
| 1:11:04| that help people start small businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=4264)|
| 1:11:07| Interfaith draws on pro bono doctors to work at Interfaith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=4267)|
| 1:11:13| So, in my mind, that sounds kind of like what this is talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=4273)|
| 1:11:17| You get maybe financial planners and folks who do some pro bono work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=4277)|
| 1:11:21| Is that kind of what we're talking about as a piece of this program?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=4281)|
| 1:11:26| Yeah, it could be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=4286)|
| 1:11:27| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=4287)|
| 1:11:29| To be exact, you know, I think that is a model that's been utilized out there, and a part| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=4289)|
| 1:11:32| of it can be financial counselors or managers that are actually part of the program with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=4292)|
| 1:11:39| the additional supports, financial planners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=4299)|
| 1:11:42| I love where we're going here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=4302)|
| 1:11:44| And like the mayor said, we're in the baby stages, but I think it's got great potential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=4304)|
| 1:11:48| I love the idea that there's actually a grant process that gives you a little money to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=4308)|
| 1:11:52| the planning so that you can really line that up for what's culturally best for us here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=4312)|
| 1:11:56| in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=4316)|
| 1:11:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=4317)|
| 1:11:58| Thank you, Councilmember Fuga.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=4318)|
| 1:11:59| I'll just say that these ideas are very much consistent with what my goals are for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=4319)|
| 1:12:06| city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=4326)|
| 1:12:07| And this grant will allow us to sort through who does it, how it's done, and how it gets| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=4327)|
| 1:12:13| to the people who need it most.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=4333)|
| 1:12:14| So those are all good questions that, you know, if we get this grant, we could help| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=4334)|
| 1:12:19| answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=4339)|
| 1:12:20| Councilmember Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=4340)|
| 1:12:21| Yeah, I just wanted to say to Mr. Ryerson, this is – it'll be interesting to see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=4341)|
| 1:12:28| how the work is accomplished.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=4348)|
| 1:12:30| I do hope you guys get the grant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=4350)|
| 1:12:32| But this need has been discussed in the past, so I'm glad that there's, you know, a way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=4352)|
| 1:12:37| to fund this discussion and launch something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=4357)|
| 1:12:41| A while back, well before me, previous council passed local ordinance to try and limit some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=4361)|
| 1:12:48| of the predatory lending because we're really over-endowed with that here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=4368)|
| 1:12:56| And one of the conversations was how to locate counseling, financial services counseling,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=4376)|
| 1:13:03| other help services near those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=4383)|
| 1:13:07| And the number of predatory lending institutions – and I know they're not going to like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=4387)|
| 1:13:12| it that I said that, but it is what it is – was actually identified over the map of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=4392)|
| 1:13:16| the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=4396)|
| 1:13:17| And there was kind of a conversation about which major areas of the city had more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=4397)|
| 1:13:24| Because different council members felt like their district had more, and so there was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=4404)|
| 1:13:29| a surprising conversation about where the majority of them – who won, I should say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=4409)|
| 1:13:33| that negative competition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=4413)|
| 1:13:36| So we're really overdue for something like this to kind of help people get away from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=4416)|
| 1:13:41| that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=4421)|
| 1:13:42| These institutions, these businesses keep locating on our major corridors in some of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=4422)|

| 1:13:54| it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=4434)|
| 1:13:55| So we're way past overdue for something like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=4435)|
| 1:13:57| So I hope that it can launch and foster and grow into something that will remedy and move| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=4437)|
| 1:14:03| us away from that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=4443)|
| 1:14:05| Not by itself, of course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=4445)|

| 1:14:08| In fact, what's really interesting, the Nashville model actually – it's titled| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=4448)|
| 1:14:14| the Financial Empowerment Center, but they actually had multiple sites to address those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=4454)|
| 1:14:19| very issues, to address neighborhoods that may likely have transportation issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=4459)|
| 1:14:25| All sorts of things can go into the planning around this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=4465)|
| 1:14:27| So it's pretty exciting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=4467)|
| 1:14:28| There's even a program that had kind of that payday loan buyback program, where there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=4468)|
| 1:14:34| was an offer – because some people get in that cycle and they can't get out because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=4474)|
| 1:14:38| of the fees and interest and all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=4478)|
| 1:14:40| That there's actually buyback programs where a third party can buy back that loan and set| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=4480)|
| 1:14:45| up terms that are more manageable for the individual to really get back level set.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=4485)|
| 1:14:50| So anyways, that's a little off track, but yeah, there's a lot of exciting elements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=4490)|
| 1:14:54| of what this could be going forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=4494)|

| 1:19:20| If Mr. Cannon would just give us a summary of- of what this resolution was for and why| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=4760)|

| 1:19:24| Mr. Cannon, you were speaking at the-| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=4764)|
| 1:19:28| Yes, Mayor Harold Cannon, Director of Engineering, City of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=4768)|
| 1:19:34| Councilman Thomas, this is in support of our existing real estate staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=4774)|
| 1:19:40| staff. We have a number of projects that require numerous acquisitions, either by fee simple| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=4780)|
| 1:19:47| or by easement, in order for the projects to proceed successfully, the number of which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=4787)|
| 1:19:53| is really overwhelming for the staff that we have, at times that we have. And they do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=4793)|
| 1:20:00| a great job, let me assure you of that. Under this resolution, we will enter into a contract| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=4800)|
| 1:20:08| on an on-call basis with Vaughan and Melton, and they've served in this capacity before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=4808)|
| 1:20:15| where they will supplement our staff as needed, and that the $300,000 is a cap. That is not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=4815)|
| 1:20:23| the amount they will get, but it basically, it is an hourly contract, and that's the threshold| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=4823)|
| 1:20:29| that they cannot cross over this next three-year period without council's approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=4829)|
| 1:20:37| Does that answer your question, I hope?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=4837)|
| 1:20:38| If you could elaborate a little bit on what kind of acquisitions are supplemented, what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=4838)|
| 1:20:39| part of the infrastructure that we're trying to augment. I'm getting to that, but I'm not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=4839)|
| 1:20:40| sure whether or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=4840)|
| 1:20:41| I'm getting it as well, sir. And hopefully, it's not on my end. If it is, let me apologize| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=4841)|
| 1:20:42| to all of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=4842)|
| 1:20:44| On a typical roadway project, as an example, there's a fixed roadway, and that's a roadway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=4844)|
| 1:20:50| project, and that's a roadway project, and that's a roadway project, and that's a roadway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=4850)|
| 1:20:57| project, and that's a roadway project, and that's a roadway project, and that's a roadway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=4857)|
| 1:21:04| to, in a manner that provides accessibility to all. There is not enough room within our,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=4864)|
| 1:21:27| what I will call our existing property, to accommodate that. So, we have to go out and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=4887)|
| 1:21:32| acquire that right-of-way. On greenway projects, we acquire by fee simple or easement through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=4892)|
| 1:21:38| properties. That gives us the right to not only do the construction, but continue with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=4898)|
| 1:21:46| the long-term maintenance of those areas. Severe Avenue, as an example, requiring easements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=4906)|
| 1:21:53| for utilities, relocation, as well as the relocation of storm sewers through that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=4913)|
| 1:22:01| So, it varies from project to project, but what we end up with is the rights not only| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=4921)|
| 1:22:07| to construct, but to take care of what we have constructed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=4927)|
| 1:22:10| CHAIRPERSON WEEKS Okay. Thank you, Mr. Powell. I just thought| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=4930)|
| 1:22:15| it was important that the public got a little bit more of a view about why we're doing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=4935)|
| 1:22:25| So, thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=4945)|
| 1:22:26| COUNCILMEMBER PARKER I'm assuming since this is coming to us as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=4946)|
| 1:22:40| a resolution, this is something that was included in the budget we approved over the summer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=4960)|
| 1:22:45| Is that correct? CHAIRPERSON WEEKS Yes, ma'am. I believe that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=4965)|
| 1:22:50| is correct. Bear with me just one moment, please. The funding actually will come from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=4970)|
| 1:23:04| each capital project. For this particular work, it will come from the projects themselves,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=4984)|
| 1:23:10| which you have approved in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=4990)|
| 1:23:12| COUNCILMEMBER BRACE Councilmember Parker, this is David Brace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=4992)|
| 1:23:16| When items come on council, there's a review through purchasing and through the finance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=4996)|
| 1:23:19| department to make sure that the funds are adequate and available and approved in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=4999)|
| 1:23:23| budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=5003)|
| 1:23:24| COUNCILMEMBER BRACE I just wanted to ask that clarifying question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=5004)|
| 1:23:28| because I just didn't notice it as a part of the budget. But, you know, I imagine it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=5008)|
| 1:23:35| didn't get a line item. So, thank you for that clarification. The only thing I wanted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=5015)|
| 1:23:40| to lift up was that, I don't know, this just struck me as an extraordinary agenda item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=5020)|
| 1:23:50| I've heard so much from community members who are overwhelmed with development projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=5030)|
| 1:23:57| And now we know that the amount of capital projects we're pursuing has exceeded the capacity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=5037)|
| 1:24:04| of our city. I just find that extraordinary. And I would say, you know, that maybe we should| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=5044)|
| 1:24:12| listen to some of those community members who are saying, please slow down in my area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=5052)|
| 1:24:16| You know, we want progress in South Knoxville, but we feel overrun by development at the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=5056)|
| 1:24:21| same time. And I know a lot of those capital dollars are going to South Knoxville on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=5061)|
| 1:24:25| waterfront.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=5065)|
| 1:24:27| It's clear from this agenda item that the need for this additional help is to be able| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=5067)|
| 1:24:34| to reach out and engage those who are directly affected by the development going on. So,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=5074)|
| 1:24:41| this represents for us not only city officials who are, you know, engaging with, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=5081)|
| 1:24:51| the public, but a whole nother crew of people that we're bringing in to engage and get information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=5091)|
| 1:24:57| and with the public. And so, you know, just keep in front of mind that folks might be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=5097)|
| 1:25:02| a little overwhelmed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=5102)|
| 1:25:03| Mayor, may I speak to that just briefly, please, ma'am?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=5103)|
| 1:25:08| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=5108)|
| 1:25:09| Councilwoman Parker, I understand your point. And the great news is, is that any of these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=5109)|
| 1:25:17| projects come through council before they can be implemented. So, you all control the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=5117)|
| 1:25:24| key that turns this on or off. I will say that a lot of the work that will be done by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=5124)|
| 1:25:31| Vaughn and Melton is for public projects, not tied to development, but for improvements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=5131)|
| 1:25:38| to our own infrastructure to create the greenways, the sidewalks, improve the roadways as they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=5138)|
| 1:25:45| should be done. It is not just development tied. And quite frankly, we're seeing some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=5145)|
| 1:25:52| progress on projects that have been logjammed for a few years that I think you'll be very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=5152)|
| 1:25:58| pleased to see coming to the forefront when we start talking about them at budget time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=5158)|
| 1:26:03| Thank you, Director Cannon. Mr. Bray, did you have something to add to clarify?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=5163)|
| 1:26:10| Just one other comment. Great point, Councilwoman Parker. And obviously, part of this is actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=5170)|
| 1:26:16| to work with engaging the community. I just want to note that we utilize contract services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=5176)|
| 1:26:21| routinely and they come before council. Our engineering department contracts with design| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=5181)|
| 1:26:26| professionals, civil engineers on a regular basis. In the private sector, even though| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=5186)|
| 1:26:31| we have civil engineers on staff, we contract with a private garbage collection service,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=5191)|
| 1:26:37| even though we have sanitation workers to pick up downtown. So, there's a real balance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=5197)|
| 1:26:41| between what we do in-house and what we do through contractors. And again, as projects| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=5201)|
| 1:26:47| warrant, we'll ramp up and we'll utilize contractors for certain needs. And then oftentimes, those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=5207)|
| 1:26:56| contracts will go on for multiple years. So, it's not uncommon, but hopefully this will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=5216)|
| 1:27:01| allow our folks to engage with community members through that right-of-way process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=5221)|
| 1:27:06| Thank you, Mr. Bray. So, any further questions, comments, or discussion? Seeing none, Mr. Johnson,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=5226)|
| 1:27:14| please come back to roll call vote. Councilman Thomas?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=5234)|
| 1:27:18| Yes. Councilwoman Hugot?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=5238)|

| 1:45:23| Chester Avenue in Knoxville, zip code 37915. Thank you for the opportunity to speak this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=6323)|
| 1:45:33| I wanted to speak about the stadium, specifically the taxpayer funding of the stadium. I missed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=6333)|
| 1:45:40| the previous meeting that you guys had where you guys discussed the sports authority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=6340)|
| 1:45:45| But some of the things I wanted to talk about tonight was the next steps moving forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=6345)|
| 1:45:51| So, one of the things I wanted to mention was in Nashville, when they did their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=6351)|
| 1:46:01| minor league baseball stadium, one of the things that happened was they went over budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=6361)|
| 1:46:08| on the stadium itself by $10 million. And then they also did not calculate for $21 million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=6368)|
| 1:46:15| in infrastructure done around the stadium. So, they did a report, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=6375)|
| 1:46:20| why were their budget numbers so off by $31 million? And what their report said was they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=6380)|
| 1:46:28| rushed it. That's why. So, I think that's an important lesson that Knoxville can learn from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=6388)|
| 1:46:33| Nashville is that when we're talking about spending tens of millions of dollars, possibly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=6393)|
| 1:46:40| an upwards to $80 million, you know, let's take our time here. It's an important decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=6400)|
| 1:46:47| We have to figure out what's in the best interest of the community. And it's really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=6407)|
| 1:46:54| be reckless to rush it. And there's really no advantage for our community to rush it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=6414)|
| 1:47:00| So, that's an important thing. Another thing is what's going to be the application process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=6420)|
| 1:47:06| for the sports authority. I just looked on the city of Knoxville's website, where people can go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=6426)|
| 1:47:12| to join boards. I don't see any link up there for people to apply. Vice Mayor McKenzie just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=6432)|
| 1:47:22| pointed out a process that you guys are going to be announcing for the restoration task force.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=6442)|
| 1:47:29| Maybe I missed it. If there was an announcement made about the sports authority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=6449)|
| 1:47:33| So far, I haven't seen anything publicly. You know, this is important because who's going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=6453)|
| 1:47:40| be on the board? Is it going to be, yes, people for the project? Or is it going to be taxpayer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=6460)|
| 1:47:44| watchdogs? People looking out for the community's interest. And then specifically, people who are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=6464)|
| 1:47:50| looking out for the interest of the community around the baseball stadium. So, I think that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=6470)|
| 1:47:56| important, too. Another thing is we're talking, again, about spending $80 million on a,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=6476)|
| 1:48:06| you know, I think by any perspective, whether you're for it or against it, it's a risky project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=6486)|
| 1:48:11| when you're talking about spending that much money and spending it on this type of a project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=6491)|
| 1:48:17| And I'm not aware that any feasibility study has been done. And by that, I mean a truly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=6497)|
| 1:48:22| independent feasibility study looking at, you know, alternatives. Does the scale of the project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=6502)|
| 1:48:29| make sense for our community? Does the dollar amount of the project make sense for our community?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=6509)|
| 1:48:35| Could our community actually be prioritizing our infrastructure in other ways?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=6515)|
| 1:48:41| So, again, you know, I hope we're not being reckless by skipping over something that would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=6521)|
| 1:48:48| seem like if a private developer was doing this type of development, independent feasibility study| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=6528)|
| 1:48:54| would probably be one of the first things they would have done before going out and getting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=6534)|
| 1:48:59| funding and financing options to consider. And then another thing, you know, has been in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=6539)|
| 1:49:06| news recently, minor league baseball has contracted. I think it's about 40 teams fewer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=6546)|
| 1:49:14| As we've seen examples in other cities, there's no guarantee that once you build a stadium that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=6554)|
| 1:49:21| the team will stay. Teams can go bankrupt. The minor league baseball can contract again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=6561)|
| 1:49:29| And so, some discussions I've heard, I'm not sure if this was mentioned at a city council meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=6569)|
| 1:49:35| but definitely at a county commission workshop or meeting, they were talking about a 30-year bond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=6575)|
| 1:49:41| 30-year bond. I think a more financially responsible approach would be looking at a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=6581)|
| 1:49:47| 20-year bond because, again, you know, the current owner of the Smokies, he has wanted to leave| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=6587)|
| 1:49:55| Kodak, I think, less than 25 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=6595)|
| 1:49:57| 30 seconds left, Mr. Wyatt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=6597)|
| 1:50:00| Thank you, Mayor. And so, it's just something to consider, I think, moving forward as far| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=6600)|
| 1:50:04| as a more financially responsible approach is to look at a 20-year option as opposed to a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=6604)|
| 1:50:11| 30-year option. And again, I just want to say thank you for the opportunity to speak tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=6611)|
| 1:50:19| That's all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=6619)|
| 1:50:21| Okay. Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=6621)|
| 1:50:23| Next person signed up to speak is Stephen White. Mr. White, are you on the call?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=6623)|
| 1:50:35| Stephen White, are you on the Zoom call? Mr. Johnson, do you know if he's...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=6635)|
| 1:50:40| Yes, I'm here. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=6640)|
| 1:50:42| Okay. Mr. White, if you could start by stating your name and address for the record,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=6642)|
| 1:50:45| and you'll have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=6645)|
| 1:50:48| My name is Stephen White, and my address is 3418 Lansing Avenue, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37914.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=6648)|
| 1:50:56| So, starting out, it's Mayor Kincannon, Vice Mayor McKenzie, Council Members Ameda Parker,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=6656)|
| 1:51:02| Seema Singh, Charles Thomas, Janet Sessoman, Lynn Bugate, Law Writer Andrew Roberto,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=6662)|
| 1:51:09| Tommy Smith, and recorders Will Johnson and Angela Hopper, and Dr. Charles Lomax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=6669)|
| 1:51:17| I'd like to introduce myself to some and reintroduce myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=6677)|
| 1:51:21| I am, again, Stephen White, and I am the co-founder and CEO of All-in-One.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=6681)|
| 1:51:27| I want to first thank you all for your dedicated service. I know it takes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=6687)|
| 1:51:32| a lot of effort to get things done, and happy New Year's as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=6692)|
| 1:51:37| Starting out, All-in-One is a startup. It is a minority-owned social media-based credit union| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=6697)|
| 1:51:44| startup. Our goal or our mission is to help as many people become financially literate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=6704)|
| 1:51:52| to increase their wealth, and to help people just overall experience life as happily as they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=6712)|
| 1:51:57| possibly can. I'm presenting today to suggest, one, that I would like to be a part of the equity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=6717)|
| 1:52:07| team. And after Vice Mayor McKenzie's update, I'm more aware of how to actually apply for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=6727)|
| 1:52:16| And I would like to just present a little bit about who All-in-One is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=6736)|
| 1:52:22| as well as present how interested we are in securing funding. I think it would be really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=6742)|
| 1:52:31| awesome to secure funding via the Knoxville's budget, the Knox County's budget, the state of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=6751)|
| 1:52:38| Tennessee's budget, and the allotment, if it's coming from private vendors as well, to help| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=6758)|
| 1:52:48| provide a business accelerator. I'm not really sure how many people are familiar with the business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=6768)|
| 1:52:55| accelerator, but the goal of it is to help entrepreneurs that are in the idea stage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=6775)|
| 1:53:03| as well as those businesses that are already established, to be supported via consultation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=6783)|
| 1:53:09| and capital. So, with that being said, I think that Knoxville has a major opportunity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=6789)|
| 1:53:18| and not just Knoxville, but Tennessee as a whole, considering it has four major cities in Memphis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=6798)|
| 1:53:25| Nashville, Knoxville, and Chattanooga. And then there are places like Sevierville and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=6805)|
| 1:53:33| some of the other resorts that can really contribute to a thriving economy, probably| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=6813)|
| 1:53:40| unlike any other city or region globally. And in support of that understanding, I think that it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=6820)|
| 1:53:48| would be really awesome as we move forward in determining allocation of funds for African| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=6828)|
| 1:53:56| American-owned businesses and just businesses of color as a whole. I think it could be most| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=6836)|
| 1:54:04| beneficial to further tap into the excellency or the resource of the Knoxville Entrepreneurship| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=6844)|
| 1:54:16| Center. All in all, I just wanted to suggest that I think a business accelerator to go along with a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=6856)|
| 1:54:25| minority-owned financial institution that can provide educational technology that helps| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=6865)|
| 1:54:31| entrepreneurs to better understand what they're good at, what they're great at, maybe some of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=6871)|
| 1:54:39| their weaknesses as well. And overall, what they can do to thrive during a time where there are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=6879)|
| 1:54:47| many unknowns in regards to income and just revenue as well. So...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=6887)|
| 1:54:52| You have about a minute left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=6892)|
| 1:54:54| Awesome. So I just want to say thank you all for listening. Our website is www.weareallinone.com,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=6894)|
| 1:55:04| and that's spelled A-L-L-I-N-W-O-N. So that's weareallinone.com. And we have a commercial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=6904)|
| 1:55:12| that we just released, and hopefully it'll give you a better understanding about what we want to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=6912)|
| 1:55:18| do and what the future of finance and minority-owned businesses can look like. And when| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=6918)|
| 1:55:26| I say minority-owned, that includes everyone. I think there are benefits to just more inclusiveness| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=6926)|
| 1:55:37| and diversity as a whole. So thank you all. Thank you, Mr. White. Last person signed up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=6937)|
| 1:55:43| for public forum is Mr. Bentley Marlowe. Mr. Marlowe, you're on the call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=6943)|
| 1:55:53| Hi there. My name is Bentley Marlowe. I live at 322 Douglas Avenue, 37921. Happy new year to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=6953)|
| 1:56:01| everyone. I just wanted to briefly let you all know that we are kind of in the midst of a lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=6961)|
| 1:56:08| of gun violence here in Mechanicsville. It seems to be pretty rampant throughout the entire city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=6968)|
| 1:56:14| but I'm sitting here hearing the gunshots on a daily basis here in Mechanicsville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=6974)|
| 1:56:20| And on the wee hours of New Year's Day, I had a very candid and productive conversation with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=6980)|
| 1:56:29| Lieutenant DeBow with the Knoxville Police Department. And I know that there's a lot of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=6989)|
| 1:56:38| national sentiment against the police. But at some point, and I think the situation that unfolded in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=6998)|
| 1:56:47| D.C. last week highlights the very real need for well-trained, well-staffed, well-equipped police| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=7007)|
| 1:56:56| officers and police forces. And I hope that's not lost in all of the anger and frustration that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=7016)|
| 1:57:06| experienced by people on all sides of the aisle. I believe the city of Knoxville needs to take a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=7026)|
| 1:57:13| long and hard look at how it recruits and how it pays and how it treats its police officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=7033)|
| 1:57:22| I believe that we have a shortage of officers. Perhaps there's a good time to also think about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=7042)|
| 1:57:32| maybe not limiting the total number of officers by something as rigid as the city charter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=7052)|
| 1:57:38| that perhaps as this city is growing, we need more flexibility to grow our police force.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=7058)|
| 1:57:44| But I guess before we start that kind of conversation, we need to talk about how we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=7064)|
| 1:57:47| can even staff it at the levels that we're supposed to have. And I think that is a process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=7067)|
| 1:57:54| that will take some time, but I hope that there is a willingness both with the council and with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=7074)|
| 1:58:01| citizens of Knoxville to seriously look at and talk about how we can better attract and retain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=7081)|
| 1:58:09| quality police officers so that we can get some of this gun violence and gang violence and drug| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=7089)|
| 1:58:15| crimes under control. I just wanted to voice my support and opinion of that, and hopefully,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=7095)|
| 1:58:24| we can find the public and political will to move forward. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=7104)|
| 1:58:27| VICE CHAIR TERRELL. Thank you, Mr. Marley. Council members, that concludes public forum,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=7107)|
| 1:58:34| and so I move that we adjourn this meeting, and we'll see each other in two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=7114)|
| 1:58:40| MS. MCDOWELL. Stay well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=7120)|
| 1:58:42| VICE CHAIR TERRELL. Thank you. I'll be safe. Have a good evening. Goodbye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210112?start=7122)|
