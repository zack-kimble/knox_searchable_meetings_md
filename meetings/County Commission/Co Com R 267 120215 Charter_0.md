| 0:00:00| It is time to call into session this initial meeting of the Charter Review Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=0)|
| 0:00:03| My name is Mike Hammond. I'm Chairman of the Knox County Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=3)|
| 0:00:06| Thanks to each of you for being here. Thanks to each of you for being willing to serve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=6)|
| 0:00:10| You have a very important task in front of you, and that is to review the Charter of Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=10)|
| 0:00:15| and to make recommendations which will be put before our citizens for a vote in November.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=15)|
| 0:00:20| The reason I mention November is we don't think that you will have sufficient time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=20)|
| 0:00:24| to do your work and have it completed by the August ballot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=24)|
| 0:00:27| It needs to be 60 days prior to an election, so if it were in August,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=27)|
| 0:00:31| that means you'd have to have your work done by June,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=31)|
| 0:00:34| and we just feel that you're going to need some time to do your work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=34)|
| 0:00:38| and so that's why we're looking at August.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=38)|
| 0:00:40| But if you feel that you can get it done before that, please let us know, and we will take a look at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=40)|
| 0:00:45| So again, we're looking at a November date, which means that your work would need to be done by the end of July| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=45)|
| 0:00:50| because ballots have to go out to our military within 45 days of Election Day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=50)|
| 0:00:54| so we want to make sure that everything is done properly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=54)|
| 0:00:57| The way that it will work is if you vote to put something on the ballot for our citizens to vote on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=57)|
| 0:01:03| it will go directly to the Election Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=63)|
| 0:01:06| There had been some question as to whether or not that would come before County Commission for review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=66)|
| 0:01:10| The answer, as I believe Mr. Jarrett, is no, and he's going to talk about this a little later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=70)|
| 0:01:14| You will go directly to the Election Commission with whatever you vote to decide,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=74)|
| 0:01:18| and again, the work you do is extremely important because you're going to be helping shape our government| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=78)|
| 0:01:23| for years to come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=83)|
| 0:01:25| Commissioner Smith, do you have a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=85)|
| 0:01:26| A quick question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=86)|
| 0:01:27| You're talking about the Election Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=87)|
| 0:01:28| Let's say we come up with seven or eight different things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=88)|
| 0:01:30| Do they put seven different items out, or are they going to be all grouped as to one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=90)|
| 0:01:35| No, they'll treat each individual item as a separate ballot initiative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=95)|
| 0:01:39| No more bundling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=99)|
| 0:01:40| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=100)|
| 0:01:41| So this will be separate, and again, he'll go over this as far as your responsibilities and so forth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=101)|
| 0:01:48| but again, I just want to say thank you for serving because this is something that's vital and needed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=108)|
| 0:01:53| and the work that you do is extremely important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=113)|
| 0:01:55| Our first item of business is to select a chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=115)|
| 0:01:59| The way we will do this is we are going to call the roll first to make sure that we have a correct number of folks here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=119)|
| 0:02:06| and we have a quorum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=126)|
| 0:02:07| After that, we will be asking each of you, we'll be calling on each of you individually,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=127)|
| 0:02:11| to select the name of a chair to chair this charter review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=131)|
| 0:02:14| After we have selected a chair, we will select a vice chair,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=134)|
| 0:02:17| and then we will select a secretary for this group as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=137)|
| 0:02:22| So first of all, let's call the roll and determine that we have a quorum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=142)|
| 0:02:27| I know we do, but we'll call the roll.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=147)|

| 0:03:09| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=189)|

| 0:03:15| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=195)|
| 0:03:21| Mr. Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=201)|
| 0:03:22| You want to go around, you said, on nomination like we're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=202)|
| 0:03:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=205)|
| 0:03:26| Twenty members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=206)|
| 0:03:27| Twenty members are present, so we do have a quorum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=207)|
| 0:03:29| So the way we will do this is we will call each name individually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=209)|
| 0:03:31| If you have someone you'd like to place a nomination for chair, please do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=211)|
| 0:03:35| We will then vote, and we will continue voting until one person gets a majority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=215)|
| 0:03:39| And so if someone does not get a majority and we have more than one name,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=219)|
| 0:03:43| we will drop off the name that has the lowest number of votes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=223)|
| 0:03:46| and we'll continue until we get someone who has the sufficient number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=226)|
| 0:03:51| Also, Mr. Jarrett, the fact that we have 20, I believe, 21 people here now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=231)|
| 0:03:57| do we need a majority of the 21 or a majority of the 27?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=237)|
| 0:04:00| No, sir, you'll need a majority of the committee as a whole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=240)|
| 0:04:03| It's 27, so that means 14.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=243)|
| 0:04:05| Correct, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=245)|
| 0:04:06| So someone will need to get 14 votes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=246)|
| 0:04:08| So, clerk, we'll start with each person,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=248)|
| 0:04:13| and if you have a name to place a nomination, please feel free to do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=253)|
| 0:04:20| Sam McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=260)|
| 0:04:21| Pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=261)|
| 0:04:23| Keith Lindsey is not here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=263)|
| 0:04:26| Ian Hennessey is not here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=266)|
| 0:04:28| Amy Broyles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=268)|
| 0:04:29| I'd like to nominate Sam McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=269)|
| 0:04:36| Renee Hoyas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=276)|
| 0:04:38| Sam McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=278)|
| 0:04:42| If the name has already been put in nomination, you don't need to do it again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=282)|
| 0:04:45| but thank you for doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=285)|

| 0:25:38| All right. What we'll do is we'll listen to the presentation by the law director,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=1538)|
| 0:25:43| and then we'll come back and we'll convene to have maybe a brief discussion about when our next meeting would be and maybe how we press on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=1543)|
| 0:25:54| Mr. Law Director, it's all yours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=1554)|
| 0:26:24| Thank you. We we good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=1584)|
| 0:26:34| Okay. Well, good evening again, folks, and welcome to the inaugural meeting of the Charter Review Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=1594)|
| 0:26:42| I don't want to speak for the mayor because he's in the back of the room, but on behalf of the mayor, the county commission, welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=1602)|
| 0:26:49| This is the epitome of participative governments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=1609)|
| 0:26:51| This is the opportunity to actually serve on a committee that has substance and that does a great service for the people of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=1611)|
| 0:26:59| Knox County Charter, in essence, is a mini constitution, and it's the manner in which we rule and guide the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=1619)|
| 0:27:05| And it can affect the way citizens enjoy their county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=1625)|
| 0:27:08| And it likewise assists us in understanding and appreciating those changes that may be warranted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=1628)|
| 0:27:15| So we'll go over a few of those things tonight, a little bit about the Sunshine Law and some ethics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=1635)|
| 0:27:20| I'll get you out of here quickly and as painlessly as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=1640)|
| 0:27:23| I know when a lawyer says that, you get nervous, but I can't pass the blake as I work for government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=1643)|
| 0:27:27| So starting off, the reason this is up here, this is my screensaver.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=1647)|
| 0:27:33| It's when I was stationed on the then West German-Czech-Slovakian border, you know, in a tank.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=1653)|
| 0:27:38| And I was giving a talk recently to a bunch of young people, and I said, I'll stand for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=1658)|
| 0:27:43| We were talking about governance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=1663)|
| 0:27:44| And in the end, I said, I'll stand for questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=1664)|
| 0:27:46| So, of course, the comedian in the front row says, dude, do you still have the tank?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=1666)|
| 0:27:51| I said, well, two things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=1671)|
| 0:27:52| One, call me dude again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=1672)|
| 0:27:53| I'm going to slap you in the head.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=1673)|
| 0:27:54| And I said, two, yeah, genius.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=1674)|
| 0:27:55| I bought it on the county purchasing card.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=1675)|
| 0:27:58| How long do you think it took for me to get a call?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=1678)|
| 0:28:01| Mr. Jarrett, I understand you just bought yourself a vehicle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=1681)|
| 0:28:04| My point is this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=1684)|
| 0:28:06| This is a Sunshine Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=1686)|
| 0:28:08| This committee operates in full view of the general public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=1688)|
| 0:28:11| What you say, what you do is subject to public scrutiny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=1691)|
| 0:28:16| The documents we pass around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=1696)|
| 0:28:18| My point is this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=1698)|
| 0:28:19| This is a high-profile committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=1699)|
| 0:28:21| It has the interest of the general public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=1701)|
| 0:28:23| So that puts an extra emphasis and a responsibility on us to ensure that we follow the rule of law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=1703)|
| 0:28:37| Mr. Mayor, did you want to say anything before we begin?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=1717)|
| 0:28:40| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=1720)|
| 0:28:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=1721)|
| 0:28:43| Now, just real quickly, three types of governance in Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=1723)|
| 0:28:47| We have the constitutional or the standard form of county government based, of course,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=1727)|
| 0:28:51| although all of our forms of government are based on the Constitution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=1731)|
| 0:28:55| When we hear people talk about a constitutional form of governance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=1735)|
| 0:28:58| we're essentially talking about a county that doesn't have a charter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=1738)|
| 0:29:02| and that essentially just gets its rule of law from case law and, of course, from the Tennessee Code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=1742)|
| 0:29:09| Then there is what you've also heard as city-county consolidation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=1749)|
| 0:29:12| the consolidation of both a city, a municipality, and a county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=1752)|
| 0:29:16| otherwise known as a metropolitan form of government,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=1756)|
| 0:29:18| and you'll see that, of course, in Metro-Davidson County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=1758)|
| 0:29:22| Then the third provided by our Constitution is, of course, the charter form of government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=1762)|
| 0:29:27| Ninety-five charters, ninety-five counties, rather, two charters, Shelby and Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=1767)|
| 0:29:34| So you can see we're a very unique form of government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=1774)|
| 0:29:40| Now, under a charter form of government, what is the power and authority?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=1780)|
| 0:29:44| Why do we even bother?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=1784)|
| 0:29:45| Who cares about home rule?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=1785)|
| 0:29:46| Well, in essence, it's this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=1786)|
| 0:29:48| First of all, we can pass resolutions and ordinances, and the distinction being this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=1788)|
| 0:29:53| an ordinance is essentially a local law that the commission would pass,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=1793)|
| 0:29:58| whereas a resolution is more the express will of the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=1798)|
| 0:30:02| But we can pass both of those,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=1802)|
| 0:30:04| and we don't have to ask the legislature for permission like other counties do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=1804)|
| 0:30:09| However, understand that these laws we pass, these ordinances,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=1809)|
| 0:30:14| cannot be inconsistent or violate state law,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=1814)|
| 0:30:18| and that becomes important because a lot of people will have a lot of good ideas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=1818)|
| 0:30:22| and we'll get calls in my office all the time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=1822)|
| 0:30:24| why doesn't the commission do an ordinance on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=1824)|
| 0:30:26| or why don't we do a charter petition to do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=1826)|
| 0:30:29| Well, if it's inconsistent with state law or if it violates federal or state law,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=1829)|
| 0:30:34| we can't do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=1834)|
| 0:30:35| For instance, the state and the federal government oftentimes preempt certain laws.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=1835)|
| 0:30:40| They'll say, for instance, only the state can deal with interstate commerce| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=1840)|
| 0:30:43| or only the federal government can deal with immigration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=1843)|
| 0:30:46| So there are limitations on that which we can do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=1846)|
| 0:30:49| and of course county ordinances cannot affect the manner in which a municipality,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=1849)|
| 0:30:53| in other words a city, conducts its business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=1853)|
| 0:30:58| Now, as you know, the way our charter reads,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=1858)|
| 0:31:01| our charter does call for the Charter Review Committee, hence your reason for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=1861)|
| 0:31:07| Now, notice the duty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=1867)|
| 0:31:09| Give ample opportunity to county officeholders| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=1869)|
| 0:31:12| and members of the general public to make suggested changes to the charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=1872)|
| 0:31:16| So that implies that you're going to, of course,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=1876)|
| 0:31:18| be interacting with members of the general public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=1878)|
| 0:31:21| They'll know you're on the committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=1881)|
| 0:31:22| and they'll probably suggest to you things that you may want to bring to the full committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=1882)|
| 0:31:29| Also, these, as Commissioner and Chairman Mike Hammond alluded to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=1889)|
| 0:31:35| we did not pass Go Here, Collect $200.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=1895)|
| 0:31:38| It goes from you to the Election Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=1898)|
| 0:31:42| Now, obviously we have to ensure that these laws are valid and legal and supportable before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=1902)|
| 0:31:50| You know, we just don't send the Election Commission anything we prefer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=1910)|
| 0:31:54| What you essentially send them is those laws that are going to be valid and supported by law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=1914)|
| 0:32:01| So it requires due diligence, and I'll ask you to be as diligent as we possibly can be, of course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=1921)|
| 0:32:10| But again, they go straight to the Election Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=1930)|
| 0:32:13| They submit these charter amendments and certify them, and they put them on the ballot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=1933)|
| 0:32:18| You'll essentially follow Robert's Rules of Procedure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=1938)|
| 0:32:21| but the County Commission Rules of Procedure are streamlined at this point somewhat,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=1941)|
| 0:32:26| and they default to Robert's Rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=1946)|
| 0:32:28| Don't worry about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=1948)|
| 0:32:29| We'll handle that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=1949)|
| 0:32:31| But again, you know, there is a process we'll follow to ensure motions are properly made and things are passed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=1951)|
| 0:32:38| So I just ask you to be as diligent, in fact, as diligent as I was when I was in the military.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=1958)|
| 0:32:44| Okay, bad example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=1964)|
| 0:32:45| But my point is this is an important committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=1965)|
| 0:32:49| We want to make sure we do our due diligence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=1969)|
| 0:32:52| So where does this leave us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=1972)|
| 0:32:53| This is a sunshine committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=1973)|
| 0:32:55| This is open government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=1975)|
| 0:32:56| Why?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=1976)|
| 0:32:57| Because it's formed in such a manner that you are actually doing a governmental function.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=1977)|
| 0:33:01| So that means you have to follow the sunshine law, which is not just merely for elected officials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=1981)|
| 0:33:07| So what does the Open Meetings Act talk about?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=1987)|
| 0:33:09| It basically says no meetings is secret.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=1989)|
| 0:33:12| Where two or more of you are gathered, there is a public meeting in your midst.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=1992)|
| 0:33:16| So be very careful talking to one another about anything that goes on in the committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=1996)|
| 0:33:22| Make sure it's during an open meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=2002)|
| 0:33:24| Now, that doesn't mean if you see one another at a function or if you're in a grocery store,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=2004)|
| 0:33:28| you have to run in opposite directions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=2008)|
| 0:33:30| Just don't discuss committee business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=2010)|
| 0:33:33| That's done in an open forum where the public can be present and participate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=2013)|
| 0:33:39| And the commission is probably real weary of hearing this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=2019)|
| 0:33:42| But notice the way the law reads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=2022)|
| 0:33:45| It says all meetings of any governing body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=2025)|
| 0:33:47| Now, you presume to think we're a committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=2027)|
| 0:33:49| We're not a governing body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=2029)|
| 0:33:51| But the way the law reads essentially, again, any decisions or recommendations to a public body| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=2031)|
| 0:33:58| makes you basically, in essence, a governing body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=2038)|
| 0:34:01| So you are covered under the Open Government Act, the government of sunshine law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=2041)|
| 0:34:05| If you have any questions about any of these things whatsoever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=2045)|
| 0:34:08| don't feel you have to get on the computer and do research.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=2048)|
| 0:34:10| You call me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=2050)|
| 0:34:11| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=2051)|
| 0:34:16| I'll sell those at the end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=2056)|
| 0:34:19| You've got to pay me personally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=2059)|
| 0:34:21| Before you leave tonight, I have copies of the charter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=2061)|
| 0:34:23| I have copies of the Open Government Sunshine Law,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=2063)|
| 0:34:26| and I have copies of the ethics policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=2066)|
| 0:34:28| So you'll get all three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=2068)|
| 0:34:29| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=2069)|
| 0:34:36| Is that the sunshine meeting that's going to take place tonight?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=2076)|
| 0:34:40| Is there an office that you can go out to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=2080)|
| 0:34:44| Yes, a good question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=2084)|
| 0:34:46| Let's say three committee members want to meet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=2086)|
| 0:34:48| They want to discuss an issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=2088)|
| 0:34:50| That is a sunshine meeting, which means it has to be noticed, there has to be an agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=2090)|
| 0:34:54| and the public has to be welcome as the media, and you need at least 48 hours' notice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=2094)|
| 0:35:00| But that will go through the commission office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=2100)|
| 0:35:02| The best bet is to call me, and we'll get you set up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=2102)|
| 0:35:05| I don't want you to feel you're out there having to do anything on your own.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=2105)|
| 0:35:07| We'll handle the administrivia and also help coordinate your calendar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=2107)|
| 0:35:12| Again, adequate public meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=2112)|
| 0:35:15| We'll worry about getting these meetings noticed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=2115)|
| 0:35:17| We'll worry about ensuring that minutes are taken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=2117)|
| 0:35:20| Tonight, graciously, the clerk is here, so this is being recorded,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=2120)|
| 0:35:23| so we actually have a record of what's going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=2123)|
| 0:35:26| No secret votes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=2126)|
| 0:35:27| You vote publicly, just like you did a public vetting for your officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=2127)|
| 0:35:31| You'll vote on these things that go forward, and that's how it will work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=2131)|
| 0:35:35| Now, there are some exceptions to the sunshine rule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=2135)|
| 0:35:38| If a single member of this committee decides to speak at a rotary club,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=2138)|
| 0:35:42| she or he can do that as long as there's not another member present| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=2142)|
| 0:35:45| and you're not deliberating or discussing business of the committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=2145)|
| 0:35:50| Chance meetings that I discussed earlier, you both end up going to the same function.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=2150)|
| 0:35:54| Again, one of you does not have to run from the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=2154)|
| 0:35:57| Just don't discuss committee business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=2157)|
| 0:36:01| Also, lunch meetings, people ask about that all the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=2161)|
| 0:36:05| Again, all of these things are required.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=2165)|
| 0:36:07| You know, the point is this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=2167)|
| 0:36:09| You're going to be doing a lot of difficult and technical work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=2169)|
| 0:36:12| If you violate the sunshine law, it's not so much that you're going to get arrested,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=2172)|
| 0:36:16| but what it will do, it will nullify your efforts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=2176)|
| 0:36:19| and a court will step in and say, whatever you decided to do is now null and void.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=2179)|
| 0:36:23| Scrap it and start all over again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=2183)|
| 0:36:25| Okay, this is Bert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=2185)|
| 0:36:28| This is my blind cat, and I have no idea why he's in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=2188)|
| 0:36:31| But I like Bert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=2191)|
| 0:36:32| Moving on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=2192)|
| 0:36:33| Okay, penalties for noncompliance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=2193)|
| 0:36:36| Actions in violation of the sunshine law are void.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=2196)|
| 0:36:39| In other words, gone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=2199)|
| 0:36:40| So all your hard work goes in vain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=2200)|
| 0:36:43| And, again, people can sue in court for these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=2203)|
| 0:36:48| The courts take a very jaundiced eye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=2208)|
| 0:36:51| They don't like these cases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=2211)|
| 0:36:52| They expedite them, and they usually react harshly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=2212)|
| 0:36:55| So, again, it's better to be a little paranoid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=2215)|
| 0:36:57| Just be very careful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=2217)|
| 0:36:58| If you have a question, call me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=2218)|
| 0:37:00| Again, don't feel you have to sit there and try to muddle through the Tennessee Code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=2220)|
| 0:37:06| Okay, real quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=2226)|
| 0:37:07| Open records.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=2227)|
| 0:37:08| Again, as I mentioned earlier, the documentation you produce as a body are public records.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=2228)|
| 0:37:14| And you'll hear a lot of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=2234)|
| 0:37:15| There's always a lot of people out there who make presumptions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=2235)|
| 0:37:17| Well, I marked draft on it, so it's not too bad, so sad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=2237)|
| 0:37:20| If you generate a document that is intended to be circulated to the committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=2240)|
| 0:37:24| and published, it's a public document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=2244)|
| 0:37:30| Now, this body of law is constantly evolving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=2250)|
| 0:37:34| What is a public document?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=2254)|
| 0:37:35| Well, it just keeps getting better and better and better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=2255)|
| 0:37:37| That means what about my e-mails?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=2257)|
| 0:37:39| You bet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=2259)|
| 0:37:40| What about a letter I send?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=2260)|
| 0:37:41| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=2261)|
| 0:37:42| What about notes I take?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=2262)|
| 0:37:44| Very possibly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=2264)|
| 0:37:45| So, really, most anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=2265)|
| 0:37:47| Just presume to think that anything you do is subject to public scrutiny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=2267)|
| 0:37:52| So be careful what you say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=2272)|
| 0:37:53| Be careful what you commit to writing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=2273)|
| 0:37:55| Presume someone is going to look at it and they're going to publish it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=2275)|
| 0:38:03| Now, public access to records.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=2283)|
| 0:38:05| Again, don't worry about public records requests.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=2285)|
| 0:38:07| If someone calls you and says, I noticed you were at the committee the other day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=2287)|
| 0:38:11| I'm a concerned citizen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=2291)|
| 0:38:13| Can I see whatever those documents were that you were given or that you handed out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=2293)|
| 0:38:17| You call me because we'll handle that as your records custodian.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=2297)|
| 0:38:21| We will deal with people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=2301)|
| 0:38:22| And, again, our law is pretty clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=2302)|
| 0:38:25| You have to be a Tennessee citizen to have access to the records anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=2305)|
| 0:38:28| Oftentimes, people out of state will look for documents, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=2308)|
| 0:38:32| They're not entitled to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=2312)|
| 0:38:34| But the point is, don't fear you're going it alone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=2314)|
| 0:38:37| You have a question, you call me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=2317)|
| 0:38:41| And, again, just call us if you have a problem or a question with anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=2321)|
| 0:38:45| Sunshine law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=2325)|
| 0:38:46| Open records law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=2326)|
| 0:38:47| That's why we're here, to give you that advice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=2327)|
| 0:38:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=2331)|
| 0:38:52| Real quickly, I'm just going to go through the ethics code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=2332)|
| 0:38:54| And the reason I say quickly, because the ethics code applies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=2334)|
| 0:38:59| However, really where you're going to have to be concerned about, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=2339)|
| 0:39:02| primarily is conflicts of interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=2342)|
| 0:39:04| So what's the dilemma?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=2344)|
| 0:39:08| The most recent study we have, these are the kind of things people see and have reported.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=2348)|
| 0:39:13| Conflicts of interest in patronage, abusive behavior.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=2353)|
| 0:39:16| These are the kind of things that the general public has complained about when dealing with government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=2356)|
| 0:39:20| So we always try to avoid any kind of ethics dilemma by complying strictly with the law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=2360)|
| 0:39:26| Now, we're required to have an ethics policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=2366)|
| 0:39:30| We're required, likewise, to have ethical standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=2370)|
| 0:39:33| And, again, I'll give you a copy of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=2373)|
| 0:39:36| Ours is on the website.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=2376)|
| 0:39:38| But here's some of the things you have to worry about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=2378)|
| 0:39:40| Misuse of official position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=2380)|
| 0:39:42| You're in a position now where you're going to be making some very determinative,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=2382)|
| 0:39:45| important decisions about the future of the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=2385)|
| 0:39:48| That means if someone calls you and asks you to abuse your position| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=2388)|
| 0:39:52| or tries to get you to vet something that you feel is inappropriate or threatens you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=2392)|
| 0:39:57| not that any of those scenarios would arise, but if you ever feel that something's amiss,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=2397)|
| 0:40:01| you call my office and we will step in and we will handle it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=2401)|
| 0:40:04| So, again, for all intents and purposes, during the course of your service,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=2404)|
| 0:40:08| we will watch over you and protect you during this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=2408)|
| 0:40:15| Disclosing conflict of interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=2415)|
| 0:40:17| If you're up here and you're in voting mode, you're going to vote on something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=2417)|
| 0:40:20| and somebody proposes a charter amendment and you're directly affected by it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=2420)|
| 0:40:24| either monetarily or through family or whatever, disclose it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=2424)|
| 0:40:29| Come to me and say, look, I'm not comfortable voting on this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=2429)|
| 0:40:32| because you're trying to change the pension plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=2432)|
| 0:40:35| and I've got two sons and a daughter that are vested in that plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=2435)|
| 0:40:38| and I have a bias, I don't want this to go through or I want it to go through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=2438)|
| 0:40:43| You disclose that, it's over, no issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=2443)|
| 0:40:45| Disclose the conflict of interest, then you stay away from the vote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=2445)|
| 0:40:48| you stay away from the discussion, you're protected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=2448)|
| 0:40:52| So those are really the big things we worry about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=2452)|
| 0:40:55| abuse of official position and any potential conflict of interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=2455)|
| 0:40:59| Again, the ethics policy is more in-depth, you'll get a copy of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=2459)|
| 0:41:02| but it deals with all kinds of things that are really related to whistleblowing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=2462)|
| 0:41:06| proprietary information that really is more towards employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=2466)|
| 0:41:09| and people strictly with the government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=2469)|
| 0:41:12| But again, kind of wordy, but the bottom line is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=2472)|
| 0:41:15| when we talk about a conflict of interest, as you can see,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=2475)|
| 0:41:19| if it affects the officials or employees' vote on the measure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=2479)|
| 0:41:22| may, to the extent allowed by law, recuse him or herself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=2482)|
| 0:41:26| In other words, don't get in that position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=2486)|
| 0:41:28| If something's coming up, you're not comfortable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=2488)|
| 0:41:30| you call me and say, is this a conflict of interest,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=2490)|
| 0:41:32| and I'll give you a ruling on it, and then we can just state it for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=2492)|
| 0:41:35| There are many times county commissioners will come to me before a meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=2495)|
| 0:41:38| and say, we've got a resolution coming up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=2498)|
| 0:41:41| do you think I have a conflict of interest?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=2501)|
| 0:41:43| And I will tell them, no, you do not, but we'll still put it on the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=2503)|
| 0:41:46| Commissioner so-and-so had a concern, appreciate the disclosure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=2506)|
| 0:41:49| but however, the commissioner can vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=2509)|
| 0:41:53| And again, the misuse of official position I alluded to earlier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=2513)|
| 0:41:57| you can see verbatim what it reads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=2517)|
| 0:42:00| Do not use your influence or position or violate the position of trust| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=2520)|
| 0:42:06| to get a special privilege for yourself or others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=2526)|
| 0:42:09| And hopefully we won't have any of these issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=2529)|
| 0:42:11| but every now and then someone wants an accommodation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=2531)|
| 0:42:13| and someone wants a favor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=2533)|
| 0:42:15| And this is the time to say, I cannot help you, I cannot accommodate you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=2535)|
| 0:42:19| because again, the charter is the ruling guide for the manner in which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=2539)|
| 0:42:23| the county commission enacts its legislation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=2543)|
| 0:42:27| That's the duty and responsibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=2547)|
| 0:42:29| And the duty and responsibility for which you've assigned yourselves| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=2549)|
| 0:42:32| is a very important one, and one, again, that does affect the manner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=2552)|
| 0:42:37| in which we protect the people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=2557)|
| 0:42:40| So if you have any questions, you call my office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=2560)|
| 0:42:44| We will handle it for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=2564)|
| 0:42:46| Anything whatsoever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=2566)|
| 0:42:48| Don't ever think it's too trivial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=2568)|
| 0:42:49| That's why we're here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=2569)|
| 0:42:50| You call us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=2570)|
| 0:42:51| Say I've got a problem, I've got this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=2571)|
| 0:42:53| Regardless of how innocuous it may be, give us a call and we'll deal with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=2573)|
| 0:42:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=2579)|
| 0:43:00| That's kind of it in a nutshell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=2580)|
| 0:43:02| Now, again, this is not something you need to commit to memory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=2582)|
| 0:43:05| I will have all the documentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=2585)|
| 0:43:06| I will give you a copy of the charter tonight, a copy of the ethics policy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=2586)|
| 0:43:10| and a document that explains in great detail open records and open government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=2590)|
| 0:43:16| Questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=2596)|
| 0:43:17| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=2597)|
| 0:43:22| Yes, and for some reason I thought I had cards with me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=2602)|
| 0:43:25| and we'll post this on the web, but 215-2327, best way to reach me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=2605)|
| 0:43:34| But, again, we'll get you that contact information as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=2614)|
| 0:43:37| Other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=2617)|
| 0:43:39| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=2619)|
| 0:43:43| CTV will probably be doing them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=2623)|
| 0:43:46| That's our understanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=2626)|
| 0:43:48| And it wouldn't be unusual, folks, for the media to show up as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=2628)|
| 0:43:52| Besides our print media, you may also see Channel 8, Channel 6 may show up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=2632)|
| 0:43:56| They may ask you for a soundbiter to go on camera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=2636)|
| 0:43:59| You're not obligated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=2639)|
| 0:44:01| If you want to, fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=2641)|
| 0:44:04| We're really blessed in this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=2644)|
| 0:44:06| The media doesn't take pot shots at us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=2646)|
| 0:44:08| so they'll normally ask you a straightforward question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=2648)|
| 0:44:10| I understand you're vetting this change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=2650)|
| 0:44:12| Why did you do it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=2652)|
| 0:44:13| If you're not comfortable talking to the media,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=2653)|
| 0:44:15| you tell them I really don't want to go on camera or call me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=2655)|
| 0:44:19| Other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=2659)|
| 0:44:23| Well, Mr. Chair, if you want to adjourn back up to the dais| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=2663)|
| 0:44:25| and start looking at calendars, I'll start getting the handouts ready.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=2665)|
| 0:44:27| Thank you for your indulgence, folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=2667)|
| 0:44:58| No, I've got to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=2698)|
| 0:45:01| I nominate Amy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=2701)|
| 0:45:23| Is there an issue with Marko's call on the roll?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=2723)|
| 0:45:27| Are you going to address that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=2727)|
| 0:45:33| I'm going to go ahead and open up the floor for if anybody has any questions about really anything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=2733)|
| 0:45:41| as far as this body is going to do or any suggestions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=2741)|
| 0:45:47| Two, three, two, seven.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=2747)|
| 0:45:48| Any concerns?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=2748)|
| 0:45:51| I have one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=2751)|
| 0:45:52| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=2752)|
| 0:45:53| We've got 18 folks up here who I'm assuming don't have a parking card.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=2753)|
| 0:46:00| Are we going to make any arrangements for the citizens who come| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=2760)|
| 0:46:03| and serve on this committee for parking?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=2763)|
| 0:46:05| I think there needs to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=2765)|
| 0:46:06| Is the mayor still here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=2766)|
| 0:46:09| What about in the top level open?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=2769)|
| 0:46:12| They can come from this side and park on the top?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=2772)|
| 0:46:15| They can't get in the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=2775)|
| 0:46:16| They have to walk all the way around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=2776)|
| 0:46:17| Mr. Chairman, PBA's board chair is here, Mr. Stokes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=2777)|
| 0:46:21| Maybe he can help you with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=2781)|
| 0:46:25| Thank you, Mr. Roundtree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=2785)|
| 0:46:28| PBA would be happy to look at it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=2788)|
| 0:46:30| and I'll talk to Dale tomorrow and have Dale Smith get a hold of you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=2790)|
| 0:46:33| and see about getting cards issued, and then we'll see how to get them distributed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=2793)|
| 0:46:36| I think that would be a good idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=2796)|
| 0:46:37| I mean, because there might be meetings that we might meet during the day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=2797)|
| 0:46:45| I don't know if that's something that this committee will need to discuss,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=2805)|
| 0:46:49| if we're going to have all our meetings after hours| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=2809)|
| 0:46:51| or if we might have some meetings during the day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=2811)|
| 0:46:57| You know, there's always a possibility that a committee member may need to come in before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=2817)|
| 0:47:04| so I think having them with a pass would be a good idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=2824)|
| 0:47:11| Commissioner Broyles, you have your light on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=2831)|
| 0:47:14| Yes, I have a question about process, about how| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=2834)|
| 0:47:20| and when items will be added to the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=2840)|
| 0:47:23| Is there going to be a cutoff time for new things to be considered as possible charter changes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=2843)|
| 0:47:32| I'm curious about what our process is going to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=2852)|
| 0:47:35| And I think that's going to be something that's going to have to evolve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=2855)|
| 0:47:38| Obviously, it's going to be, you know, as this body determines,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=2858)|
| 0:47:43| is it going to be something such as the way the commission runs their business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=2863)|
| 0:47:49| as turning in agenda items by a certain time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=2869)|
| 0:47:54| I tend to think that this type of body with this type of work may work a little different than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=2874)|
| 0:48:02| I think that if someone comes in, this is just my opinion, okay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=2882)|
| 0:48:08| that if committee members have suggestions that they would like to bring forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=2888)|
| 0:48:13| I think they should be able to bring those forward at our meetings and then they can be discussed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=2893)|
| 0:48:21| and then maybe we put those off and vote on those types of things at a future meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=2901)|
| 0:48:27| Because I really want to make sure that every member of this body has a chance to have their views| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=2907)|
| 0:48:37| and their opinions respected and brought forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=2917)|
| 0:48:41| I think it's very important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=2921)|
| 0:48:43| I think we are all here because we do bring a wide range of perspectives and opinions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=2923)|
| 0:48:51| and we need to bring that forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=2931)|
| 0:48:53| But, you know, we're going to move this as a body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=2933)|
| 0:48:56| We're going to move it forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=2936)|
| 0:48:58| It's not going to be my way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=2938)|
| 0:49:00| It's going to be the committee's way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=2940)|
| 0:49:02| And that's just sort of my thoughts on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=2942)|
| 0:49:06| And if anybody has any thoughts on that, they're welcome to voice them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=2946)|
| 0:49:11| Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=2951)|
| 0:49:12| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=2952)|
| 0:49:14| The one thing, though, that I think we should have all picked up out of the presentation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=2954)|
| 0:49:18| is that we do have to have an agenda and it has to be 48 hours old.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=2958)|
| 0:49:23| And the reason for that is so that if there are items on the agenda a citizen would like to discuss,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=2963)|
| 0:49:31| they'll know to be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=2971)|
| 0:49:33| If there are not items of importance to citizens of a specific nature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=2973)|
| 0:49:39| And it might be that we start out a very general type of agenda, like we're going to open it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=2979)|
| 0:49:48| And until we sort of go through the process and that we actually have ideas of where we think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=2988)|
| 0:49:54| or if committee members think that here's an item that we need to discuss.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=2994)|
| 0:50:00| And I would refer to that as brainstorming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=3000)|
| 0:50:02| And then for the next meeting after that we would have an agenda item which would encapsulate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=3002)|
| 0:50:09| whatever that might be that we should discuss.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=3009)|
| 0:50:12| And then we could always still, once we have some of those items,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=3012)|
| 0:50:15| I still think we probably need to still have that sort of brainstorming type of item on the agenda| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=3015)|
| 0:50:22| because as we go through this I can see that new ideas will come forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=3022)|
| 0:50:28| and we need to allow ourselves a chance to add things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=3028)|
| 0:50:36| Then we could put it maybe on the more formal agenda for the next time we meet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=3036)|
| 0:50:42| Those are just some thoughts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=3042)|
| 0:50:44| And I think this is going to be an evolving process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=3044)|
| 0:50:47| And that's why I think the fact that we're going to give ourselves, I think, until the November election,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=3047)|
| 0:50:55| it gives us the time for this body to evolve and make sure that we're moving forward in a direction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=3055)|
| 0:51:02| that will be good for all citizens of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=3062)|
| 0:51:06| Barbara.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=3066)|
| 0:51:07| Chairman Lithow, it occurs to me, well, this, of course, is just my thinking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=3067)|
| 0:51:14| but it's also my experience because I kind of worked on charters in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=3074)|
| 0:51:20| And the assumption I would make would be that we are going to review the charter in sections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=3080)|
| 0:51:27| Would that be a correct assumption?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=3087)|
| 0:51:29| Well, that would be a good idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=3089)|
| 0:51:31| And I think that's something that we could get the law director to maybe put forth an idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=3091)|
| 0:51:41| Mr. Law Director, do you think that would be something that your office could do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=3101)|
| 0:51:45| Well, the reason I suggest that is because it gives us that opportunity to know what the agenda is going to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=3105)|
| 0:51:53| So we know it's going to involve the next meeting will involve a certain area of the charter or a certain section.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=3113)|
| 0:52:01| And then, consequently, there will be people from the public who would like, perhaps, to address that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=3121)|
| 0:52:10| I presumed in a public forum because of the sunshine provisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=3130)|
| 0:52:16| So that seems to me to be an orderly way in which to do it so that we don't interject only our thinking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=3136)|
| 0:52:25| But if we review it in sections, some sections can be quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=3145)|
| 0:52:30| And that's a good idea?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=3150)|
| 0:52:31| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=3151)|
| 0:52:32| I mean, the key is to become familiar with the charter enough to see that there are some portions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=3152)|
| 0:52:36| that just really don't merit any change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=3156)|
| 0:52:38| And that's the key, trying to discern the difference between that which requires change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=3158)|
| 0:52:42| and that which is presently fine and functions well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=3162)|
| 0:52:46| But, yeah, any time you can compartmentalize it and take it in small chunks, it just makes it less onerous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=3166)|
| 0:52:53| And that assists us in being able to sunshine our agendas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=3173)|
| 0:52:57| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=3177)|
| 0:53:02| Ms. Javonsky.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=3182)|
| 0:53:04| Yes, I just wanted to question if we have any set format for the entire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=3184)|
| 0:53:10| If you lean too far forward, you hit the mute button.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=3190)|
| 0:53:13| Oh, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=3193)|
| 0:53:16| Just if we're going to have any sort of set format as to the process of this committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=3196)|
| 0:53:21| This kind of follows with what Ms. Broyles and Ms. Pilow said about the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=3201)|
| 0:53:27| Also, other than Robert's rules, do we have some regulations concerning what is our quorum?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=3207)|
| 0:53:38| You know, members who do not meet, you know, two or three times in a row.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=3218)|
| 0:53:46| I mean, Robert's does set out how someone is removed because failure to perform their duties, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=3226)|
| 0:53:54| Other than Robert's regulations, which I will disclose, I am a certified parliamentarian.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=3234)|
| 0:54:00| But I know that everybody is not that familiar with all of the ins and outs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=3240)|
| 0:54:05| Are we going to establish our own rules of process?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=3245)|
| 0:54:11| Mr. Law Director, I assume we'll be following Robert's rules unless we make up our own.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=3251)|
| 0:54:17| Yeah, those are the choices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=3257)|
| 0:54:18| I mean, the charter doesn't address that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=3258)|
| 0:54:20| The charter merely reads that the county commission may establish its own rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=3260)|
| 0:54:25| If you actually have, you know, between Mr. Luthold and yourself both having familiarity with Robert's rules,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=3265)|
| 0:54:33| that would probably be the best course of action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=3273)|
| 0:54:36| And what I can do is provide to all the members, I'll mail you a copy of basically Robert's rules in a nutshell,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=3276)|
| 0:54:43| which it handles, you know, it's an 800-page tome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=3283)|
| 0:54:46| However, as you know, there are the basic motions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=3286)|
| 0:54:50| And we can start with that, but that will, I think, establish at least some semblance of order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=3290)|
| 0:54:56| Unless, of course, you know, again, as a body you decide we're going to set it aside and do something totally different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=3296)|
| 0:55:04| And that could be an item that we discuss at our next meeting as to whether we want to just abide by Robert's rules| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=3304)|
| 0:55:10| or if we want to come up with our own.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=3310)|
| 0:55:14| I think that that might be a good idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=3314)|
| 0:55:16| Just go ahead and have that on the agenda for our next meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=3316)|
| 0:55:22| Just as a redress, address rather, I think that having Robert's rules as your basis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=3322)|
| 0:55:29| obviously I'm in favor of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=3329)|
| 0:55:34| But there are certain aspects such as has been said before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=3334)|
| 0:55:39| the 48-hour rule of something to appear on the agenda, public notice of the agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=3339)|
| 0:55:46| those types of things which would not be covered in Robert's but that could, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=3346)|
| 0:55:53| help us again, as it said, with the Sunshine Law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=3353)|
| 0:55:56| I mean, obviously, I think the first thing we have to do is abide by the laws set forth by the State of Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=3356)|
| 0:56:03| as far as Open Meetings Act.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=3363)|
| 0:56:06| But, Mr. Law Director, do you have anything else that you'd like to add to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=3366)|
| 0:56:11| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=3371)|
| 0:56:12| We'll ensure that the agenda is properly set.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=3372)|
| 0:56:14| You don't have to worry about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=3374)|
| 0:56:15| If you send something in and it's not timely, we'll just move it to the next agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=3375)|
| 0:56:19| And, of course, you can convene whenever you'd like if you give sufficient notice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=3379)|
| 0:56:23| so you're not even stuck to your own calendar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=3383)|
| 0:56:25| If something comes up and you feel that you need an emergency meeting, well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=3385)|
| 0:56:28| we can certainly affect that as long as it's more than 48 hours notice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=3388)|
| 0:56:34| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=3394)|
| 0:56:36| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=3396)|
| 0:56:39| One of the things we've got to decide, as you mentioned earlier, is the frequency of meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=3399)|
| 0:56:44| This has to be done by August to get on the November ballot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=3404)|
| 0:56:49| It's certainly going to have to be more than one meeting a month to get that accomplished| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=3409)|
| 0:56:53| because, you know, that's only six months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=3413)|
| 0:56:56| So we need to establish whether it's going to be once a week, once every two weeks, what have you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=3416)|
| 0:57:02| and preferable times, whether it's, you know, one week it's a day meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=3422)|
| 0:57:06| and the next one it's an evening or what have you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=3426)|
| 0:57:08| Well, let me just real quickly, just so we can sort of knock this out maybe, do most people show,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=3428)|
| 0:57:17| I guess maybe a show of hands, I mean, does the evenings work best?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=3437)|
| 0:57:21| Do day meetings work or does it or does either work?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=3441)|
| 0:57:28| So, I mean, I'm open to however we do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=3448)|
| 0:57:35| So do we have any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=3455)|
| 0:57:37| Commissioner Smith, former Commissioner Smith, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=3457)|
| 0:57:42| I don't know if you were asking us to raise your hands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=3462)|
| 0:57:45| Well, you know, does anybody have any thoughts on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=3465)|
| 0:57:48| I mean, anybody would like to interject?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=3468)|
| 0:57:52| Amy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=3472)|
| 0:57:54| I think since the majority of this committee are citizens who probably have regular nine to five jobs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=3474)|
| 0:58:04| and also we want as much public input as possible,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=3484)|
| 0:58:07| I think having these meetings starting no earlier than 5 or 5.30 probably is going to be the best way to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=3487)|
| 0:58:15| I'm certainly open to meeting at any time, but out of respect for the citizens who are here volunteering their time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=3495)|
| 0:58:22| I think we need to make it as painless on them as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=3502)|
| 0:58:26| So I'd like to recommend we have all of our meetings beginning no later than, you know, 5, 5.30.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=3506)|
| 0:58:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=3513)|
| 0:58:34| Commissioner Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=3514)|
| 0:58:36| I just was going to say the same thing Amy did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=3516)|
| 0:58:38| I think in the evening, so working people can get here, it's both not a burden on us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=3518)|
| 0:58:43| and also if citizens wish to come down here and speak, they have that opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=3523)|
| 0:58:48| And the perception is so critical to this being successful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=3528)|
| 0:58:52| I totally agree with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=3532)|
| 0:58:54| Ms. Hoyes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=3534)|
| 0:58:56| Yeah, I was also going to add to that that we might want to consider moving the meetings around if that's possible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=3536)|
| 0:59:02| so that folks don't have to drive all the way into town and try to find parking in order to participate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=3542)|
| 0:59:09| The only thing that we've run into that is that, like, tonight's meeting, I believe, is on TV,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=3549)|
| 0:59:15| and not many locations would be able to accommodate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=3555)|
| 0:59:20| There are a few, but we can try that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=3560)|
| 0:59:22| Although I do agree with the notion of going out into the public and holding meetings out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=3562)|
| 0:59:28| and it may be that, like, if you're a member of a homeowner's group or some type of group,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=3568)|
| 0:59:35| it might be beneficial for, you know, members to go out and speak and be at these types of meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=3575)|
| 0:59:42| and maybe you can get forth a discussion out of those groups so that you can bring that back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=3582)|
| 0:59:49| So I'm not trying to tell anybody what to do, but it would be, I think, you know, as we go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=3589)|
| 0:59:54| And then I think as we come back and we actually have some hard type of here's where we're, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=3594)|
| 1:00:04| here's some things that we're looking at putting on the ballot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=3604)|
| 1:00:08| and then maybe, you know, members going out to some of these larger groups| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=3608)|
| 1:00:14| and to be there to answer questions and hear concerns, I think that would be a good thing as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=3614)|
| 1:00:23| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=3623)|
| 1:00:25| Amy, were you there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=3625)|
| 1:00:26| I have another matter I want to speak on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=3626)|
| 1:00:28| Go ahead and talk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=3628)|
| 1:00:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=3629)|
| 1:00:30| Amy, did you have anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=3630)|
| 1:00:31| I wanted to talk more about meeting days and times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=3631)|
| 1:00:34| I was running through my head the list of community groups that I'm aware of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=3634)|
| 1:00:41| not just neighborhood associations but organizations like COIN and City Council and MPC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=3641)|
| 1:00:48| and it seems to me if we're going to meet, like Commissioner Brown mentioned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=3648)|
| 1:00:54| we're going to need to meet more than once a month to get this done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=3654)|
| 1:00:57| I'd like to go ahead and make a motion that we meet the second| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=3657)|
| 1:01:00| and fourth Thursdays of each month at 5.30 p.m. to give people time to get here from work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=3660)|
| 1:01:07| Thursdays are not evenings that are typically overburdened with other community meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=3667)|
| 1:01:12| and having a regular schedule that we can go ahead and put on our calendar far in advance, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=3672)|
| 1:01:21| especially those of us with families and other obligations to plan around that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=3681)|
| 1:01:27| We have a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=3687)|
| 1:01:28| Do we have a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=3688)|
| 1:01:29| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=3689)|
| 1:01:30| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=3690)|
| 1:01:31| I'll second that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=3691)|
| 1:01:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=3692)|
| 1:01:33| We've got a second so we can discuss that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=3693)|
| 1:01:34| Mr. Law Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=3694)|
| 1:01:35| I know I don't have a vote here, but Thursdays is a night I'm not normally available,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=3695)|
| 1:01:40| and I think I should personally be to these, and I think Ed Shouse likewise said Thursdays are better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=3700)|
| 1:01:45| Wednesday's not good?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=3705)|
| 1:01:47| How about Tuesdays?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=3707)|
| 1:01:49| Anybody have a problem with Tuesday evenings?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=3709)|
| 1:01:51| No, you'll encounter city council meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=3711)|
| 1:01:53| City councils are on Tuesdays?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=3713)|
| 1:01:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=3714)|
| 1:01:55| And Thursdays are workshops for city council is one of the difficulties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=3715)|
| 1:02:01| On the Thursday where council does not meet on Tuesday, does that make sense, you will have a workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=3721)|
| 1:02:08| So every other week it's Tuesday and Thursday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=3728)|
| 1:02:11| I can amend that, too, if I know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=3731)|
| 1:02:15| Our family attends fellowship meals at church on Wednesday nights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=3735)|
| 1:02:18| I know a lot of other groups do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=3738)|
| 1:02:20| However, I'm willing to give that up twice a month to choose a night that doesn't conflict with city council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=3740)|
| 1:02:26| with school board, or with, you know, all the other community and neighborhood groups.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=3746)|
| 1:02:30| Nobody meets on Wednesdays because that's typically a church night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=3750)|
| 1:02:34| So if we stake out Wednesday nights, we're probably not going to conflict with anyone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=3754)|
| 1:02:38| and I can give up fellowship meals twice a month to come and fellowship with all of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=3758)|
| 1:02:44| Well, then, of course, you also get a potluck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=3764)|
| 1:02:47| But, Amy, you also have the public out there that might have the conflict on Wednesday nights| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=3767)|
| 1:02:51| and may not show up on Wednesday nights, is the thought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=3771)|
| 1:02:55| If you meet early enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=3775)|
| 1:02:57| If you meet at 5 o'clock, churches are at 7, so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=3777)|
| 1:03:01| Not mine, but.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=3781)|
| 1:03:03| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=3783)|
| 1:03:04| I was going to ask, there's nothing to stop us if we schedule these regularly scheduled meetings to later on add meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=3784)|
| 1:03:10| such as a public input meeting where when we do have things on the agenda| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=3790)|
| 1:03:15| or recommended that we could go out into the public, as suggested earlier, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=3795)|
| 1:03:20| at a different time of day, especially if we get into summer, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=3800)|
| 1:03:24| I mean, there's nothing to keep us from adding meetings on later down the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=3804)|
| 1:03:29| Leigh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=3809)|
| 1:03:30| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=3810)|
| 1:03:31| Yeah, I understand meeting earlier or later and the public coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=3811)|
| 1:03:35| I mean, my preference would be meeting during the day or meeting at 4 o'clock| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=3815)|
| 1:03:40| so that if our meetings are, you know, running later, you know, I have little ones, and that's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=3820)|
| 1:03:46| But 4 o'clock people could kind of get here, and then if we're, you know, church night,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=3826)|
| 1:03:50| then that would give people time to get home and get to church or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=3830)|
| 1:03:55| So it's kind of a compromise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=3835)|
| 1:03:56| I would just rather not meet at 530 and then have to be out of here at 9 o'clock at night or 10 or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=3836)|
| 1:04:03| One thing to consider about that is the fact that 430 of these folks that work in this building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=3843)|
| 1:04:09| 90% of them leave at 430.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=3849)|
| 1:04:12| At 4 or 5, you can find a parking place at 4 o'clock and you might not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=3852)|
| 1:04:16| That's so true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=3856)|
| 1:04:17| There's a mass exodus at 430.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=3857)|
| 1:04:18| I mean, it's horrendous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=3858)|
| 1:04:20| It might be easier to meet at fine parking at 2 o'clock than it is opposed to trying to come in at 4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=3860)|
| 1:04:28| But, you know, duly noted your wishes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=3868)|
| 1:04:31| And it might be that we may have to change it up from time to time depending on the availability of this room,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=3871)|
| 1:04:39| you know, that Ms. Pelow had talked about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=3879)|
| 1:04:45| Sam?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=3885)|
| 1:04:48| I just want to kind of piggyback on what Commissioner Schmidt was talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=3888)|
| 1:04:55| I think we all realize a lot of this is going to be boring and monotonous| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=3895)|
| 1:05:00| and people aren't going to just dig in and show up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=3900)|
| 1:05:04| But there's some aspects of this process that's going to draw public attention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=3904)|
| 1:05:08| So kind of like he was saying, and we probably know what those areas are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=3908)|
| 1:05:12| we could just set official public meetings to discuss this one issue, this one contentious thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=3912)|
| 1:05:21| That way, you know, we can schedule those other ones as appropriate and have due diligence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=3921)|
| 1:05:28| And if someone cares about Article 12, Section D of the commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=3928)|
| 1:05:33| they'll make a point to show up for that particular scheduled meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=3933)|
| 1:05:36| But I think we can, and as this evolves, we'll figure out which ones the public are really going to dig into.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=3936)|
| 1:05:43| That's my thought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=3943)|
| 1:05:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=3946)|
| 1:05:47| Ms. Starbuck?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=3947)|
| 1:05:48| I would just like to add, you know, that, yes, public input is very important,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=3948)|
| 1:05:53| but that we should also take advantage of electronic means of communication.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=3953)|
| 1:05:57| So I would like to see a special e-mail address advertised or publicized so that people who would like to comment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=3957)|
| 1:06:07| but maybe can't come to a meeting or something like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=3967)|
| 1:06:11| that they have a specific way that they can, you know, provide input without having to come to a meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=3971)|
| 1:06:19| I'll have to research that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=3979)|
| 1:06:20| Quite frankly, the legislature did make an exception for certain electronic communication,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=3980)|
| 1:06:25| but right now it's restricted to county commissions and to school boards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=3985)|
| 1:06:29| So that may not be appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=3989)|
| 1:06:34| But, again, this is your committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=3994)|
| 1:06:35| You know, I'll, of course, rearrange my schedule to accommodate you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=3995)|
| 1:06:40| So, you know, again, this is your committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=4000)|
| 1:06:42| When you say you're going to meet, I'm here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=4002)|
| 1:06:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=4005)|
| 1:06:46| Did you have something to add to that, Amy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=4006)|
| 1:06:47| Well, I was just going to say I had a motion on the floor for us to meet on the second and fourth Wednesdays.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=4007)|
| 1:06:54| And right now I think we've, I believe we still, you know, we need to, you're right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=4014)|
| 1:07:00| we need to hold our discussions on the item for the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=4020)|
| 1:07:05| I'll second that motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=4025)|
| 1:07:07| I think we have a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=4027)|
| 1:07:08| I have a substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=4028)|
| 1:07:09| Of the substitute, you needed a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=4029)|
| 1:07:11| Did you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=4031)|
| 1:07:12| He changed it to Wednesday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=4032)|
| 1:07:14| Yeah, I changed it to Wednesday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=4034)|
| 1:07:15| To Wednesday nights, the second and fourth Wednesdays, is that what you're saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=4035)|
| 1:07:19| Sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=4039)|
| 1:07:20| I was seconding that motion as amended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=4040)|
| 1:07:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=4043)|
| 1:07:24| Is that okay, Larry?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=4044)|
| 1:07:25| I was just going to make, you know, we can sit here and talk all night,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=4045)|
| 1:07:28| but until Craig checks and see what the availability of the room is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=4048)|
| 1:07:31| we need to find out what that is first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=4051)|
| 1:07:33| And then I don't have a problem with what you're doing there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=4053)|
| 1:07:36| but we need to see what's available to us first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=4056)|
| 1:07:39| Normally, Wednesdays, like I said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=4059)|
| 1:07:41| it's an open night because everyone assumes that everyone's going to be at church.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=4061)|
| 1:07:45| So can we go ahead and set our regular meeting times to be on Wednesdays| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=4065)|
| 1:07:50| and then tomorrow morning we can call and check PBA records and see if we're.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=4070)|
| 1:07:55| I'll check and make sure Wednesday nights will be available| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=4075)|
| 1:07:57| or whatever night we end up saying, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=4077)|
| 1:08:00| Does that motion include the time too?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=4080)|
| 1:08:04| Five o'clock?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=4084)|
| 1:08:07| Or 530?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=4087)|
| 1:08:08| Is 530 or five?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=4088)|
| 1:08:10| Five, so people can get out and get to church if we wrap it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=4090)|
| 1:08:15| Can I, can we, let's give a time from five to another period,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=4095)|
| 1:08:19| because I think we do have to be respectful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=4099)|
| 1:08:21| And that also gives us a deadline so people aren't rambling on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=4101)|
| 1:08:25| And if we don't finish, it goes to the next meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=4105)|
| 1:08:28| Good point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=4108)|
| 1:08:29| Five to seven.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=4109)|
| 1:08:30| Five to seven.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=4110)|
| 1:08:32| Amy, are you okay with that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=4112)|
| 1:08:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=4114)|
| 1:08:38| Ed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=4118)|
| 1:08:39| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=4119)|
| 1:08:41| Before, guys, probably the worst thing I do is try to remember names.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=4121)|
| 1:08:46| So if I get it wrong, I'm learning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=4126)|
| 1:08:49| and I'll try to get everybody's name down here as quickly as I can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=4129)|
| 1:08:53| By August, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=4133)|
| 1:08:55| By August, hopefully.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=4135)|
| 1:08:57| I thought Mr. McKenzie had a good point that some of this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=4137)|
| 1:09:00| there may be interest and some there may not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=4140)|
| 1:09:02| And I was going to suggest maybe an alternating time of one Wednesday is a five| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=4142)|
| 1:09:07| and one is maybe an afternoon to help accommodate some people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=4147)|
| 1:09:15| Would that be unreasonable to alternate the?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=4155)|
| 1:09:20| I don't have a problem with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=4160)|
| 1:09:22| I think, you know, obviously, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=4162)|
| 1:09:26| if you would wish to make that as a form of a substitute motion as to the motion that we have before us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=4166)|
| 1:09:34| then you're willing to, you know, you have that right to make that as a substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=4174)|
| 1:09:39| Of course, it's not going to be in stone, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=4179)|
| 1:09:41| I mean, if we see that there's a tremendous interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=4181)|
| 1:09:43| Obviously, this body could, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=4183)|
| 1:09:47| even if we make a motion that we're going to meet the second and fourth Wednesday from five to seven from now on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=4187)|
| 1:09:56| we could always change that as a body as we move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=4196)|
| 1:09:59| And if we see that there's a need to change times or change days of the week or meet more or less often,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=4199)|
| 1:10:06| we can always do that as we proceed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=4206)|
| 1:10:10| And it might, you know, as we go forward, it might become more clear to us how often| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=4210)|
| 1:10:15| and that sort of thing that we need to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=4215)|
| 1:10:18| On the 15th, we might decide we need to meet every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=4218)|
| 1:10:22| That could be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=4222)|
| 1:10:24| Commissioner Smith, did you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=4224)|
| 1:10:25| After the vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=4225)|
| 1:10:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=4226)|
| 1:10:28| Ms. Pelo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=4228)|
| 1:10:29| I'll just comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=4229)|
| 1:10:30| I don't want to muddy the water, but I understand what you're saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=4230)|
| 1:10:33| And the experience I've had in the past with this kind of charter review is that definitely there will be other times we need to meet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=4233)|
| 1:10:43| Because it's our responsibility to educate the community at some point on what we're going to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=4243)|
| 1:10:50| if we are going to put something before the public for a vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=4250)|
| 1:10:54| So my experience was that we often had to break in small groups| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=4254)|
| 1:10:59| or as a whole the commission would go to one school or different locations where we could meet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=4259)|
| 1:11:07| And then, you know, that might move your hour to 7 o'clock at night when they're meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=4267)|
| 1:11:12| or whatever time would be best for that group to be able to have the opportunity to ask questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=4272)|
| 1:11:19| and participate in the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=4279)|
| 1:11:21| So it's kind of a moving target that I don't think we'll know until we.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=4281)|
| 1:11:27| Why don't we just let the chairman use his discretion rather than try to determine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=4287)|
| 1:11:32| We spent a lot of time tonight on just this one issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=4292)|
| 1:11:35| I think this just gives us a framework and a structure moving forward that we can go ahead and put it on our calendars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=4295)|
| 1:11:41| with the understanding that there will be probably times that we're going to want to set an extra special meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=4301)|
| 1:11:47| specifically for public input if we see a hot issue coming up on the horizon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=4307)|
| 1:11:53| So this just gives us a structure and a framework so that we can go ahead and move forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=4313)|
| 1:11:58| and have something on our calendars that we can plan around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=4318)|
| 1:12:05| Mr. Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=4325)|
| 1:12:06| Mr. Chairman, the second Wednesday of next month is actually four weeks away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=4326)|
| 1:12:12| Why don't we just sort of direct ourselves toward picking our next meeting date?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=4332)|
| 1:12:24| The fifth Wednesday of February is two weeks away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=4344)|
| 1:12:31| That's the 29th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=4351)|
| 1:12:33| Maybe that's what we're looking at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=4353)|
| 1:12:34| Maybe we need to see if, well, and surely February the 29th is available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=4354)|
| 1:12:40| I mean, there's not many reoccurring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=4360)|
| 1:12:43| Sleepy year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=4363)|
| 1:12:45| Snow day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=4365)|
| 1:12:47| So we can set the fifth Wednesday as our first meeting and then the second and fourth Wednesdays after that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=4367)|
| 1:12:52| That would allow the chairman to figure out what dates are available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=4372)|
| 1:12:56| I'm good with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=4376)|
| 1:12:58| Is that your motion now that our next meeting be the 29th?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=4378)|
| 1:13:02| Well, that our next meeting be the fifth Wednesday of February| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=4382)|
| 1:13:06| and the second and fourth Wednesdays of each month thereafter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=4386)|
| 1:13:10| Well, why don't we, and that's probably fine,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=4390)|
| 1:13:13| and then by the time we get to the end of March we might have a better idea as to if we need to meet more often,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=4393)|
| 1:13:19| less often, different dates, different times, have a better feel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=4399)|
| 1:13:28| So, Ms. Brawls, will you restate your motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=4408)|
| 1:13:33| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=4413)|
| 1:13:34| That our next meeting be on the fifth Wednesday of February, which is Leap Day, the 29th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=4414)|
| 1:13:41| and going forward it would be the second and fourth Wednesdays of each month at 5 p.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=4421)|
| 1:13:52| So our next three meetings would be February 29th, then March 14th, then March 28th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=4432)|
| 1:14:00| and then going forward, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=4440)|
| 1:14:02| From 5 to 7.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=4442)|
| 1:14:04| 5 to 7.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=4444)|
| 1:14:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=4446)|
| 1:14:08| Do we have any further discussion as far as this motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=4448)|
| 1:14:14| He's going to talk about something else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=4454)|
| 1:14:16| Oh, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=4456)|
| 1:14:17| We'll just do this as a voice vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=4457)|
| 1:14:19| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=4459)|
| 1:14:21| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=4461)|
| 1:14:22| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=4462)|
| 1:14:23| Ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=4463)|
| 1:14:24| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=4464)|
| 1:14:25| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=4465)|
| 1:14:26| Just real quick, Mr. Chairman, you sort of alluded to it just a second ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=4466)|
| 1:14:29| We've got 27 people on this committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=4469)|
| 1:14:31| Not everybody knows everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=4471)|
| 1:14:34| I'd be willing, if you wanted to get together, maybe have a lunch or a dinner before a meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=4474)|
| 1:14:37| just so we can go around and say who we are and what we do, because I want to get to know everybody,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=4477)|
| 1:14:41| and I'd be happy to set that up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=4481)|
| 1:14:43| Maybe a lunch, since we're going to meet at 5, maybe a lunch meeting the day of that or just whenever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=4483)|
| 1:14:49| If you all would like to do that, I'll set it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=4489)|
| 1:14:52| As long as we sunshine it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=4492)|
| 1:14:54| How about a beer after the meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=4494)|
| 1:14:56| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=4496)|
| 1:14:57| I'll just, you know, we'll just tell the law directors off and he would get it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=4497)|
| 1:15:01| Well, Commissioner Smith, if you'd like to do something like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=4501)|
| 1:15:04| then just get with the law director and set up that time and that date so that it can be properly sunshined.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=4504)|
| 1:15:13| And I don't know if you're off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=4513)|
| 1:15:15| Mr. Law Director, will your office get notices out or the Commission's office?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=4515)|
| 1:15:20| We'll work with the Commission's secretary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=4520)|
| 1:15:22| because I want her to make sure she puts in the notice that Commissioner Smith is buying lunch for everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=4522)|
| 1:15:26| What about just go ahead on the 29th?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=4526)|
| 1:15:28| Let's just do it on that day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=4528)|
| 1:15:29| The 29th, and we're meeting at 5, so do you want to have maybe, are you saying 4 o'clock somewhere?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=4529)|
| 1:15:38| Who wants to eat dinner at 4 o'clock?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=4538)|
| 1:15:41| Well, we don't have to, it could just be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=4541)|
| 1:15:43| Why don't we come out before and then it's just one trip?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=4543)|
| 1:15:46| We'll be here at 4 and we could set something up in the small assembly room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=4546)|
| 1:15:52| That might be the easiest way to do it since we only have an hour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=4552)|
| 1:15:55| I just want people to go around and say who they are, where they work, what they do, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=4555)|
| 1:15:58| a little introduction type of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=4558)|
| 1:16:00| As long as we get some of that good prison food.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=4560)|
| 1:16:02| Yeah, we can get the sheriff to bring something up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=4562)|
| 1:16:05| You want them to do, you want me to set that up then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=4565)|
| 1:16:07| If you'd like to set that up, then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=4567)|
| 1:16:09| You want to do that at 4 o'clock?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=4569)|
| 1:16:10| Mr. Law Director, we don't need to make that as a form of motion, do we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=4570)|
| 1:16:15| Or we can just go ahead and we'll put notice out that there could be more than one member of this committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=4575)|
| 1:16:23| might be here at 4 o'clock for sort of a meet and greet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=4583)|
| 1:16:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=4587)|
| 1:16:29| We'll handle it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=4589)|
| 1:16:30| Eat and greet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=4590)|
| 1:16:31| Is it possible for those of us that have short-term memories, that happens as you get younger,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=4591)|
| 1:16:38| I'm thinking a little name, just those cardboard names.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=4598)|
| 1:16:44| Done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=4604)|
| 1:16:45| Name cards, we'll get it done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=4605)|
| 1:16:46| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=4606)|
| 1:16:47| That could be really helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=4607)|
| 1:16:49| Excellent idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=4609)|
| 1:16:50| We'll get it done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=4610)|
| 1:16:52| Now, just one more point that we need to remember as we move forward is that we are directed by the charter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=4612)|
| 1:16:59| that the office holders do need to be given the opportunity to come before us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=4619)|
| 1:17:06| such as the trustee, the clerk, the registrar of deeds, the mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=4626)|
| 1:17:11| So, you know, obviously we're going to be meeting at 5,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=4631)|
| 1:17:17| so we're going to be asking them to come, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=4637)|
| 1:17:20| after hours that they would normally be maybe heading off to some other direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=4640)|
| 1:17:24| But we'll have to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=4644)|
| 1:17:27| Mr. Law Director, how soon do you think that we need to be inviting those office holders?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=4647)|
| 1:17:31| After we get into it a little bit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=4651)|
| 1:17:35| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=4655)|
| 1:17:36| I mean, I can also contact them and just remind them that the committee is meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=4656)|
| 1:17:40| and they should start thinking about issues they want to discuss.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=4660)|
| 1:17:44| But I think your next meeting, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=4664)|
| 1:17:46| you're going to need time to just actually plow through the charter and start getting a feel for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=4666)|
| 1:17:50| But I'll put them on notice, as I have already, that you're meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=4670)|
| 1:17:53| and they need to start thinking about issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=4673)|
| 1:17:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=4676)|
| 1:17:57| And if they have any concerns that they have, and what I'm thinking is that what we'll do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=4677)|
| 1:18:02| if they could contact your office so that we can add them to the agenda| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=4682)|
| 1:18:07| so that the public will know that this office holder will be before us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=4687)|
| 1:18:13| so that if anybody has a concern about that particular office, they could be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=4693)|
| 1:18:17| I'll handle it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=4697)|
| 1:18:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=4698)|
| 1:18:19| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=4699)|
| 1:18:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=4700)|
| 1:18:21| Commissioner Burroughs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=4701)|
| 1:18:22| Yes, I just wanted to go back to something that was mentioned earlier| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=4702)|
| 1:18:26| about having an e-mail address for the public to contact us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=4706)|
| 1:18:30| We have our commission at KnoxCounty.org.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=4710)|
| 1:18:33| If someone e-mails something to the commission, it gets,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=4713)|
| 1:18:37| Julie in the commission office gets that e-mail and immediately forwards it out to all 11 of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=4717)|
| 1:18:44| So to avoid the confusion of having another e-mail address| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=4724)|
| 1:18:49| or having to set up another e-mail address,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=4729)|
| 1:18:53| if the public could just send their comments or input to that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=4733)|
| 1:18:57| then I'm sure it wouldn't be any difficulty at all for Drew| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=4737)|
| 1:19:01| and Jolie to forward it to every member of this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=4741)|
| 1:19:04| Those need to be vetted through the law department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=4744)|
| 1:19:07| Well, I'm just thinking that we've got John Guston here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=4747)|
| 1:19:10| John, do you think it would be possible to set up an e-mail so that the citizens of Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=4750)|
| 1:19:19| if they have questions, concerns, that they can e-mail out a,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=4759)|
| 1:19:24| whether it be charter.review at KnoxCounty.org so that they can send their input in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=4764)|
| 1:19:33| and then those items can be distributed amongst all the members?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=4773)|
| 1:19:38| I see it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=4778)|
| 1:19:39| The answer is yes, we can create an e-mail address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=4779)|
| 1:19:43| The selection that you will need to make as a group is who will receive that e-mail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=4783)|
| 1:19:49| And subsequently, if you want a blast e-mail to be able to go out to everyone on this group,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=4789)|
| 1:19:55| we will need to be able to have an e-mail address for everybody on this group| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=4795)|
| 1:20:00| in order to populate that mass e-mail send.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=4800)|
| 1:20:04| So I just need to know where you want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=4804)|
| 1:20:09| I can create the e-mail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=4809)|
| 1:20:10| I will do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=4810)|
| 1:20:11| And I just need to know who you want to check that e-mail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=4811)|
| 1:20:14| And subsequently, if you want e-mail sent out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=4814)|
| 1:20:16| I need to know what e-mail addresses will populate that blast e-mail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=4816)|
| 1:20:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=4822)|
| 1:20:23| Well, that's something that if we could get everybody, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=4823)|
| 1:20:26| I don't know that we need to give everybody a Knox County e-mail account,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=4826)|
| 1:20:31| but whatever e-mail account that they wish to use and then we could get.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=4831)|
| 1:20:37| It would not need to be a Knox County e-mail address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=4837)|
| 1:20:40| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=4840)|
| 1:20:41| We would hope to use people's e-mail addresses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=4841)|
| 1:20:44| Their own e-mail addresses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=4844)|
| 1:20:46| But we need something, I think, that the public can send in their ideas or concerns or questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=4846)|
| 1:20:54| so that they can, you know, communicate to us in that way as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=4854)|
| 1:21:02| Any thoughts on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=4862)|
| 1:21:04| Doesn't the commission secretary, she already has that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=4864)|
| 1:21:08| She's already communicated with us with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=4868)|
| 1:21:11| But it's not that big a deal to set up a blast e-mail once you get the 47 names.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=4871)|
| 1:21:15| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=4875)|
| 1:21:16| Once everybody turns in their e-mail account, then she can send all those e-mails out to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=4876)|
| 1:21:21| What I'm talking about is setting up a new e-mail account, getting that out to the public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=4881)|
| 1:21:27| so that if they want to contact this committee, that it comes in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=4887)|
| 1:21:34| and then those, once they come in, there's someone in charge of getting those questions out to the committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=4894)|
| 1:21:42| From a perspective of keeping things simple for Jolie and those in the commission office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=4902)|
| 1:21:49| it would probably be expeditious for us to set up a new e-mail account| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=4909)|
| 1:21:53| so that incoming e-mail to Jolie is not commingled with other things that come to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=4913)|
| 1:21:59| Yeah, I think that's why I'm saying like charter.review at Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=4919)|
| 1:22:04| where it would be different, separate from commission type of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=4924)|
| 1:22:12| I have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=4932)|
| 1:22:14| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=4934)|
| 1:22:15| What about the citizens that don't have access to e-mail who like to call and leave a message?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=4935)|
| 1:22:20| What do we do about that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=4940)|
| 1:22:22| The law department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=4942)|
| 1:22:25| We'll work out those logistics in terms of the e-mail, telephone contact,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=4945)|
| 1:22:30| because, again, there's a difference between you getting a blast e-mail from me informing you of a citizen's concern| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=4950)|
| 1:22:36| and you communicating back and forth with one another| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=4956)|
| 1:22:38| because then you're starting to get into the sunshine law issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=4958)|
| 1:22:41| So we'll work out the mechanics of that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=4961)|
| 1:22:43| We'll report back to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=4963)|
| 1:22:47| Does anybody have a problem with that e-mail account going into the commission office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=4967)|
| 1:22:51| and then they can broadcast that out to everybody else, or do they want it to go somewhere else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=4971)|
| 1:23:01| Go to the commission office?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=4981)|
| 1:23:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=4983)|
| 1:23:04| Do we need a motion or a vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=4984)|
| 1:23:06| Just do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=4986)|
| 1:23:08| I'll just make an executive decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=4988)|
| 1:23:13| We'll set up an e-mail account that will go to the commission office and that they will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=4993)|
| 1:23:17| I guess what we need to do is get everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=4997)|
| 1:23:20| If they don't have your e-mail account already,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=5000)|
| 1:23:22| is to get it to either the law director or to the commission office so that they can get you that information out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=5002)|
| 1:23:30| so they can broadcast that to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=5010)|
| 1:23:32| Because the concern always is, you've got to remember, if you're using your personal e-mail,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=5012)|
| 1:23:38| the argument could be made, well, if you're using your personal e-mail for committee business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=5018)|
| 1:23:42| it's subject to all your e-mails to public scrutiny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=5022)|
| 1:23:45| That's why we want to make sure you're protected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=5025)|
| 1:23:47| Again, we'll work out the mechanics of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=5027)|
| 1:23:49| If you could get with John and work that out, that would be great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=5029)|
| 1:23:52| Mr. Chairman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=5032)|
| 1:23:53| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=5033)|
| 1:23:54| He has a blank sheet with all the names on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=5034)|
| 1:23:56| If we started warning them to pass it around there, put their e-mail address on there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=5036)|
| 1:23:59| then he's got it all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=5039)|
| 1:24:02| Does Joe Lee already have them all?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=5042)|
| 1:24:04| I think Joe Lee may have them all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=5044)|
| 1:24:06| Is everybody receiving them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=5046)|
| 1:24:08| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=5048)|
| 1:24:09| I received it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=5049)|
| 1:24:10| Did everybody receive an e-mail from Joe Lee from the commission office?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=5050)|
| 1:24:15| Then we may already have them all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=5055)|
| 1:24:16| I just want to make sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=5056)|
| 1:24:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=5059)|
| 1:24:20| Ms. Starbuck?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=5060)|
| 1:24:22| So we don't have a motion on the floor, so we can discuss whatever, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=5062)|
| 1:24:26| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=5066)|
| 1:24:28| Margo Klein was here earlier tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=5068)|
| 1:24:30| and evidently there's some issue with whether or not she's actually a committee member.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=5070)|
| 1:24:36| I noticed that the clerk did call her name, but she did not participate tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=5076)|
| 1:24:43| I know Mr. Law Director mentioned something to him about it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=5083)|
| 1:24:47| and he said he was looking into it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=5087)|
| 1:24:49| but I just felt like since she didn't get to participate tonight that we should get some information about that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=5089)|
| 1:24:58| and what we're going to do about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=5098)|
| 1:25:00| As I said earlier, we're investigating it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=5100)|
| 1:25:01| I don't know at this point what her status is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=5101)|
| 1:25:03| This is the first I heard about it was today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=5103)|
| 1:25:05| So we'll find out whose appointment she is and why she was not originally added.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=5105)|
| 1:25:11| I can't answer that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=5111)|
| 1:25:13| I talked with her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=5113)|
| 1:25:14| She was appointed by the mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=5114)|
| 1:25:17| She was a mayor appointee for the 3rd District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=5117)|
| 1:25:20| She actually lives in the 4th District, and I think there was a concern about that particular issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=5120)|
| 1:25:27| So I don't know if she feels like she needs to resign or she's been asked to resign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=5127)|
| 1:25:33| Those particulars I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=5133)|
| 1:25:35| Those are the particulars I'm working about as well because there's two things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=5135)|
| 1:25:38| One, the mayor agreed to appoint from districts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=5138)|
| 1:25:40| and two, the charter doesn't allow any one district to be district heavy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=5140)|
| 1:25:45| But we'll get that resolved in short order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=5145)|
| 1:25:53| Barbara?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=5153)|
| 1:25:54| I feel like I've just really said too much,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=5154)|
| 1:25:56| but I want to go back to our discussion about the elected officials inviting themselves to come and talk to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=5156)|
| 1:26:06| I just want to make a comment about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=5166)|
| 1:26:09| As we review this charter in different areas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=5169)|
| 1:26:14| it's going to be obvious to us the resources that we need to come and speak to us and be involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=5174)|
| 1:26:25| I don't know how to say this without it maybe being misinterpreted, and I don't intend for that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=5185)|
| 1:26:31| but I think it's important for us to be inviting them rather than them inviting themselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=5191)|
| 1:26:40| It just falls better when the discussion is on a certain area of the charter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=5200)|
| 1:26:47| that that's a good time for them to come speak to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=5207)|
| 1:26:50| And, I mean, they can come any time they want to as part of the public,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=5210)|
| 1:26:53| but I just think it's less confusing to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=5213)|
| 1:26:56| We're not all just that well educated on the charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=5216)|
| 1:27:00| And in trying to work through all of this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=5220)|
| 1:27:03| I think we'll know the times that we really need to have with us one of the elected officials| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=5223)|
| 1:27:10| or people from that department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=5230)|
| 1:27:12| That's just my thinking, and I'm just trying to keep it all organized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=5232)|
| 1:27:19| Duly noted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=5239)|
| 1:27:20| But I do believe, Mr. Law Director, the charter does tell us that we are to invite them and hear from them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=5240)|
| 1:27:27| Well, they're, of course, encouraged to and permitted to give input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=5247)|
| 1:27:31| You know, what I could do is give them a standing invitation to come| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=5251)|
| 1:27:36| and then give them a special notice when anything that's going to come up that's remotely applicable to their,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=5256)|
| 1:27:41| you know, let's say you're talking about term limits or what have you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=5261)|
| 1:27:45| so they'll know when the meeting schedule is that they can appear at any time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=5265)|
| 1:27:49| However, that we will give them a special alert for anything that could affect the manner in which they serve Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=5269)|
| 1:27:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=5276)|
| 1:27:57| And I think that if we know in advance that a particular office holder is going to be before us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=5277)|
| 1:28:04| that we have that on the agenda so that the public will have that opportunity to be here at those times,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=5284)|
| 1:28:10| that they know that they're going to hear from, you know, Office Holder A, for instance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=5290)|
| 1:28:18| Do I hear anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=5298)|
| 1:28:23| We're going to our next meeting will be then February 29th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=5303)|
| 1:28:28| We only get to do that once every four years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=5308)|
| 1:28:31| And I'm going to suggest to everybody, Mr. Wall, Director, said that he had the charter for everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=5311)|
| 1:28:39| So please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=5319)|
| 1:28:50| Everybody will read over the charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=5330)|
| 1:28:54| And I don't know that we have anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=5334)|
| 1:28:57| Mr. Waldron, I guess we'll get together and try to come up with an agenda for the first meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=5337)|
| 1:29:03| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=5343)|
| 1:29:05| We're adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=5345)|
| 1:29:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120215charter?start=5359)|
